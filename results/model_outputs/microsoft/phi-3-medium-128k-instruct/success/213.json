    "answer": " To determine the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023, I would need to see the specific chart you're referring to. However, I can guide you on how to calculate the average if you have the data.\n\n1. Look at the chart and note the number of meets for each month (April, May, June, and July).\n2. Add the number of meets for each month together.\n3. Divide the total by the number of months (in this case, 4).\n\nFor example, if the chart shows the following number of meets:\n\n- April: 10 meets\n- May: 12 meets\n- June: 15 meets\n- July: 13 meets\n\nThe calculation would be:\n\n(10 + 12 + 15 + 13) / 4 = 50 / 4 = 12.5\n\nSo, the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023 would be 12.5 meets per month.\n\nPlease provide the chart or the data for each month, and I can assist you further.",
