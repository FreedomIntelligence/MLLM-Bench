However, as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to view or analyze images directly.\n\nIf you can describe the position of the spoon in the image or provide any other details, I could help you calculate the bounding box coordinates based on the information you provide. Alternatively, you could use image processing tools or software to detect and locate the spoon in the image and then determine the bounding box coordinates.",
