However, facial expressions can generally be identified by observing the positioning of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and overall posture. If the woman's eyebrows are raised and her eyes are wide open, she might be surprised or shocked. If her eyebrows are furrowed and her mouth is turned downwards, she could be expressing sadness or displeasure. If her mouth is curved upwards and her eyes are bright, she might be happy or amused.
