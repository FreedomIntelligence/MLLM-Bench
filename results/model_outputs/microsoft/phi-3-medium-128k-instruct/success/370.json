Please provide details about the task, the picture, and the programming language you'd like to use.\n\nHowever, I can give you a general example of a Python program that reads an image file, converts it to grayscale, and saves the new image. This example uses the Pillow library, which is a popular library for image processing in Python.\n\nHere's an example program that does this:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef convert_to_grayscale(image_path, output_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads an image file, converts it to grayscale, and saves the new image.\n\n    Parameters:\n        image_path (str): The path to the input image file.\n        output_path (str): The path to save the grayscale image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Open the image file\n    image = Image.open(image_path)\n\n    # Convert the image to grayscale\n    grayscale_image = image.convert('L')\n\n    # Save the new grayscale image\n    grayscale_image.save(output_path)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Input and output paths\n    input_path = \"input_image.jpg\"\n    output_path = \"output_image.jpg\"\n\n    # Convert the picture.\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale\ngrayscale_image = image.convert('L')\n\n# Save the new grayscale image\ngrayscale_image.save(\"grayscale_image.jpg\")\n\nprint(\"Image converted to grayscale and saved successfully!\")\n```\n\nThis program will read an image file named `input_image.jpg`, convert it to grayscale, and save the new image as `grayscale_image.jpg`. You can modify the input and output paths as needed.\n\nPlease provide more details about your task and the picture you're referring to, so I can help you write a more specific program.",
