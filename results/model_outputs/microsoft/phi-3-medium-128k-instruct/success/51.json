The construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in the 12th century, specifically in the year 1173, during the Romanesque architectural period. It is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta. The tower's construction was completed in the 14th century, with the final bell-chamber installed in 1372. The iconic lean, which it is known for, began during its construction due to unstable foundation soil and has been corrected over the centuries.",
