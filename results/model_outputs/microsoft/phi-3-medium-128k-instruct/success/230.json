Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Google's BERT comes with multi-language support, including models trained on Spanish (bert-base-multilingual-cased) and Chinese (bert-base-chinese).\n\n2. Facebook's XLM-R (Cross-lingual Language Model - RoBERTa): XLM-R is a state-of-the-art multilingual model that has been pre-trained on 100 languages, including Spanish and Chinese.\n\n3. Microsoft's mBERT (Multilingual BERT): Similar to Google's BERT, mBERT has been pre-trained on 104 languages, offering support for both Spanish and Chinese.\n\n4. Hugging Face's Transformer models: Hugging Face provides a wide range of transformer models that support multiple languages. Notably, models like XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT are available and support both Spanish and Chinese.\n\n5. TensorFlow's T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): T5 has been trained on a large corpus of multilingual data, which includes both Spanish and Chinese.\n\nPlease note that the availability of models and specific language support can evolve rapidly, and it is recommended to check the latest documentation or repositories for the most current information.",
