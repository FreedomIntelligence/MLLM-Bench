    "answer": " Based on the description of extensive damage and utter chaos, it is challenging to determine the exact type of natural disaster without visual confirmation. However, I can provide a few possibilities:\n\n1. Earthquake: Significant structural damage to buildings, roads, and bridges, as well as landslides or ground ruptures, could indicate an earthquake.\n\n2. Flood: Widespread water damage, submerged buildings, and debris piles could suggest a severe flood, possibly caused by heavy rainfall, a storm surge, or a dam breach.\n\n3. Tornado: Destruction of structures, uprooted trees, and scattered debris could point to a tornado, particularly if the damage is concentrated in a narrow path.\n\n4. Hurricane: Coastal flooding, wind damage, and storm surge could imply a hurricane, especially if the village is located near a coast.\n\n5. Wildfire: Burned vegetation, destroyed buildings, and ash-covered ground could indicate a wildfire, particularly if the village is surrounded by forests or grasslands.\n\nRemember, this is just a speculative assessment based on the description provided. To accurately identify the natural disaster, visual confirmation or additional information would be necessary.",
