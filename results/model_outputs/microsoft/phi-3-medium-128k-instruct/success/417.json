Barrel: A gear that is attached to the mainspring and releases energy to the watch's movement.\n6. Escapement: A mechanism that regulates the release of energy from the barrel to the balance wheel.\n7. Balance Wheel: A wheel that oscillates back and forth, regulating the speed of the watch.\n8.

Escape Wheel: A gear that is regulated by the escape mechanism and controls the release of energy from the barrel.\n11. Anchor Escapement: The most common type of escapement mechanism, which uses an anchor-shaped piece to regulate the movement of the escape wheel.\n12. Jewels: Synthetic diamonds or other materials used to reduce friction and wear on the watch's moving parts.\n13. Bridge: A metal plate that supports the movement and connects the various components.\n14. Hands: The pointers that indicate the time on the watch face.\n15.
