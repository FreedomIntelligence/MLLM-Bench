    "answer": " CT Brain Examination Report:\n\nPatient Information:\nName: [Patient Name]\nAge: [Age]\nGender: [Gender]\nDate of Examination: [Date]\nReferring Physician: [Referring Physician Name]\n\nClinical History:\nThe patient presented with complaints of persistent headaches, dizziness, and occasional episodes of nausea. A CT scan of the brain was ordered to evaluate the potential causes of these symptoms.\n\nCT Findings:\n\n1. Brain Parenchyma:\nThere is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration. The gray-white differentiation is preserved. No acute infarcts or abnormal enhancement are seen within the brain parenchyma.\n\n2. Cerebral Hemispheres:\nThe cerebral hemispheres appear symmetrical. There are no focal abnormalities within the cerebral hemispheres.\n\n3. Basal Ganglia and Thalami:\nThe basal ganglia and thalami appear normal in size and density. No calcifications or abnormal signal intensities are noted.\n\n4. Cerebellum and Brainstem:\nThe cerebellum and brainstem structures are unremarkable, with no mass effect or abnormal signal intensity.\n\n5. Ventricular System:\nThe ventricles are of normal size and configuration, with no evidence of hydrocephalus or ventricular enlargement.\n\n6. Cranial Fossa:\nThe anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae are unremarkable.\n\n7. Skull:\nNo evidence of skull fracture or lytic lesions. The sella turcica appears normal.\n\n8. Paranasal Sinuses:\nThe paranasal sinuses are clear without evidence of inflammation, masses, or fluid levels.\n\n9. Extracranial:\nNo abnormalities are seen in the extra-axial spaces.\n\n10. Soft Tissues:\nThe soft tissues of the head and neck are unremarkable.\n\nImpression:\n\nThe CT scan of the brain reveals no acute intracranial pathology. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or focal abnormalities within the brain parenchyma, cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalami, cerebellum, brainstem, ventricular system, cranial fossa, or paranasal sinuses. The skull and soft tissues are unremarkable. The findings are within normal limits.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nGiven the negative CT scan, further evaluation for the patient's symptoms may be warranted. Consideration of additional imaging studies, such as an MRI of the brain, or consultation with a neurologist may be beneficial.\n\nRadiologist:\n[Radiologist Name], MD\n[Specialty: Radiology]\n[Date of Report]",
