    "answer": " When we observe images from left to right, the images appear to move in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is known as the \"motion parallax\" effect.\n\nMotion parallax is a depth cue that arises from the relative motion of objects as an observer moves. When an observer moves from left to right, objects that are closer to them appear to move faster than objects that are farther away. This apparent motion is due to the difference in the time it takes for light from the different objects to reach the observer's eyes.\n\nAs a result, when we observe a scene from left to right, objects that are closer to us appear to move to the right, while objects that are farther away appear to move to the left. This effect is used in various applications, such as in virtual reality and 3D movies, to create a sense of depth and immersion.\n\nIn summary, when we observe images from left to right, the images appear to move in the opposite direction due to the motion parallax effect. This effect helps us perceive depth and distance in a scene.",
