However, I can guide you on how to find the total quantity of products that customer 3449 bought on 12/31/1996 in an Excel table.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Excel file containing the table.\n2. Click on the column header that contains the customer IDs to select the entire column.\n3. Go to the \"Data\" tab, then click on \"Filter\" in the \"Sort & Filter\" group. This will add dropdown arrows to each column header.\n4. Click on the dropdown arrow in the customer ID column and select \"3449\" to filter the table for this customer.\n5. Now, click on the column header that contains the dates and select \"12/31/1996\" to filter the table for this specific date.\n6. The table should now only display rows where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n7. Look for the column that contains the product quantities and sum them up.\n\nIf you need a more automated way, you can use the SUMIFS function in Excel. Here's an example assuming the columns are arranged as follows:\n\nColumn A: Customer ID\nColumn B: Date\nColumn C: Product Quantity\n\nThe formula would look like this:\n\n1. Open the Excel file.\n2. Use the column headers.\n3. Go to the \"Data\" tab, then click on \"Product Quantity\" in the \"Sort & Filter\" group.\n\n4. Now, look for the column that contains the product quantities and sum them up the \"SUMIFS\" function in Excel. Here's an example, assuming the columns are arranged as follows: Column A: Customer ID Column B: SUMIFS:Product Quantity\n\nThe formula would look like this:\n\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A, \"3449\", B:B \"12/31/C:C, A:A \"3449\", B: Customer ID: 3449, B:B \"12/31/3449\", B:B \"12/31/1996\")\n\n\nThis formula will return the total quantity of products that customer 34449 bought on 12/31/1996. The formula would look like this:\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A, \"3449\", B:B, \"12/31/1996\")\n\nThis formula will add up all the quantities in column C where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n\nRemember to replace the column references (C:C, A:A, and B:B) with the actual column numbers where your data is located.\n\n6. The formula would look like this:\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A \"3449\", B:B \"12/31.\n\nThis formula will add up all the quantities in column C where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n\n\nRemember to replace the column references (C:C, A:A, and B:B) with the actual column numbers where your data is located.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please provide more details.",
