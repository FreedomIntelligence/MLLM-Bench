    "answer": " The Pink Queen is not an official chess piece; it's a playful term sometimes used to refer to the Queen piece when it's pink in color, usually in chess sets designed for children or decorative ones. In a standard chess set, the Queen is either white or black, and it starts on the square of its own color (d1 for white, d8 for black or black).\n\nIf you have a chess set where the Queen is pink, please refer to the standard chessboard coordinates to find its location. The Queen starts on the d-file, so if it's the white Queen, or on the d-file on the 8th rank, if it's the black Queen.\n\nRemember, the chessboard coordinates run from a1 for the first column, to h for the last, and from 1 for the first row, to 8 if you are using the algebraic notation.",
