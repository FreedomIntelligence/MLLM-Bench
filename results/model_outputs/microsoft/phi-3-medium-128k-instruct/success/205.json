A knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction (either horizontally or vertically) and then one square perpendicular to the first direction, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular to the first direction.\n\nLet's assume the black knight is at the bottom left corner of the board, which is the square a1. From this position, the knight can move to the squares b3 and c2.\n\nIf the black knight is on a different square, the accessible squares will change accordingly.
