However, as this is a text-based platform, I can't view images. But I can provide you with a general guide on how to identify the differences between meats based on these criteria.\n\n1. Type of meat: Different meats have distinct appearances. For example, beef is usually darker than pork, while chicken is lighter in color. Lamb is typically reddish-pink, and turkey is often pale and lean.\n\n2. Cuts of meat: Different cuts have varying amounts of fat. For example, a ribeye steak will have more fat than a sirloin steak. A pork loin is leaner than a pork shoulder.\n\n3. Marbling: This refers to the visible fat within the muscle tissue. Meats with more marbling, like Wagyu beef, have a higher fat content than meats with less marbling, like lean cuts of pork.\n\n4. Trimming: Some meats are trimmed of excess fat before cooking. Look for visible fat being removed from the edges of the meat.\n\n5. Preparation methods: The way the meat is prepared can also indicate its fat content. For example, a roasted chicken may have the skin removed, while a fried chicken will have the skin left on, increasing the fat content.\n\n6. Cooking style: The cooking method can affect the fat content of the meat. Grilling, broiling, or roasting can result in less fat retention than frying or braising.\n\n7. Portion size: Larger portions may contain more fat than smaller portions, especially if the meat is marbled.\n\nBy examining these factors, you should be able to spot the differences between the meats based on their fat content and the ways they are handled.",
