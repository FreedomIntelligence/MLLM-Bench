    "answer": " The cactus that is different from the others is the Baobab tree (Adansonia). While it may share some similarities with cacti, such as thick trunk and ability to store water, it is not a true cactus. Baobab trees belong to the Malvaceae family and are native to Madagascar, mainland Africa, and Australia. Other cacti, on the other hand, are native to the Americas and are part of the Cactaceae family.",
