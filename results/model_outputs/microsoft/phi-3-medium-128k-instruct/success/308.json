    "answer": " To determine which set of upper garments would provide better warmth in a -5°C environment, let's consider common types of clothing that are suitable for cold weather:\n\n1. A thick wool sweater and thermal long johns: Wool is an excellent insulator and can retain heat even when wet. Thermal long johns are designed to provide additional warmth by trapping body heat close to the skin. This combination would be very effective in maintaining warmth, making this a good choice for cold temperatures.\n\n2. A lightweight fleece jacket and regular cotton pants: Fleece is also a good insulator and is lightweight, which makes it comfortable. However, regular cotton pants are not as insulating as thermal underwear, so this combination might not be as warm as the first option.\n\n3. A down jacket and jeans: Down jackets are excellent for cold weather due to the high warmth-to-weight ratio of down. Jeans can be quite warm, but they are not as effective at insulating as thermal underwear.\n\n4. A heavy-duty parka and thermal leggings: A heavy-duty parka is designed for extreme cold and would provide substantial warmth, and thermal leggings would offer good insulation.\n\nBased on the options provided, the thick wool sweater and thermal long johns would likely provide the best overall warmth, especially if the sweater is thick and the long johns are of good quality. However, if the parka is specifically designed for extreme cold and the leggings are well-insulated, this could also be a very effective combination.\n\nIn conclusion, if the wool sweater is thick and the thermal long johns are of a high quality, it would likely be the best option for warmth in -5°C. If the parka is designed for extreme cold, the heavy-duty parka and thermal leggings could also be a strong contender. The choice between the two would depend on the specific materials and design of the garments.",
