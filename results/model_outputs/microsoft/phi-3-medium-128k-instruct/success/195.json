There are also patches of dry, cracked skin, which might indicate a more severe stage of the condition.\n\nEstimating the stage of the condition is challenging without additional information, such as the patient's medical history or duration of the symptoms. However, based on the severity of the inflammation and the extent of scaling, it could be considered a moderate-to-severe stage.
