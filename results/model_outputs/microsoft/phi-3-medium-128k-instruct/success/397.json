    "answer": " To predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression, we first need the data from the table. Assuming you have provided the data, here's a step-by-step process to predict the capital expenditure using linear regression:\n\n1. Organize the data: Arrange the capital expenditure data in a table with two columns: Year and Capital Expenditure.\n\n2. Plot the data: Create a scatter plot with Year on the x-axis and Capital Expenditure on the y-axis. This will help visualize the relationship between the two variables.\n\n3. Determine the linear regression equation: Linear regression aims to find the best-fit line through the data points. The equation for a linear regression line is y = mx + b, where y represents the dependent variable (Capital Expenditure), x represents the independent variable (Year), m represents the slope of the line, and b represents the y-intercept.\n\n4. Calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b): Use the least-squares method to calculate the slope and y-intercept. The formulas are:\n\n   m = (N * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (N * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\n   b = (Σy - m * Σx) / N\n\n   where N is the number of data points, Σ(xy) is the sum of the products of x and y, Σx is the sum of x values, Σy is the sum of y values, and Σ(x^2) is the sum of the squares of x values.\n\n5. Plug in the values: Once you have the slope (m) and y-intercept (b), plug in the value for the year 2023 into the linear regression equation to predict the capital expenditure.\n\n6. Interpret the result: The predicted capital expenditure for the year 2023 is the value you obtained in step 5.\n\nPlease provide the data from the table, and I can help you with the calculations.",
