    "answer": " To fill the vacant space on the far right, you should select the block that is visually distinct from the others and complements the overall design. Here are some features to consider when choosing the right block:\n\n1. Color and Pattern: Choose a block that has a color or pattern that contrasts with the existing blocks. This will help it stand out and draw attention to the empty space.\n\n2. Size and Shape: If the existing blocks are of different sizes and shapes, select a block that either matches or complements the current pattern. This will create a sense of balance and harmony in the design.\n\n3. Texture: If the blocks have a specific texture, choose a block that either matches or contrasts with the existing texture. This will add depth and interest to the design.\n\n4. Theme: If the blocks have a specific theme, select a block that either matches or complements the current theme. This will create a cohesive and unified design.\n\n5. Function: If the blocks have a specific function, select a block that either matches or complements the current function. This will ensure that the design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical and functional.\n\nOnce you have considered these features, select the block that best fits the criteria and place it in the vacant space on the far right. This will complete the design and create a visually appealing and balanced composition.",
