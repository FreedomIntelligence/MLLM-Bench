A ceiling fan is mounted on the ceiling and typically has a longer blade span, while a general fan, like a tabletop fan or a tower fan, is usually freestanding and smaller in size. Ceiling fans are designed to be installed on the ceiling, providing air circulation for a larger area, whereas general fans are portable and can be placed anywhere in the room. Additionally, ceiling fans often have a motor and blades mounted on a central hub, while general fans have a base and a single motor that drives the blades.",
