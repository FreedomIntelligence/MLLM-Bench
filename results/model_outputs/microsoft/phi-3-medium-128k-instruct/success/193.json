If you can provide me with a description of the cells and their characteristics, I'll do my best to help you determine the type of cells you're referring to.\n\nFor example, if the cells are described as being round or oval in shape, with a nucleus, and surrounded by a cell membrane, they could be eukaryotic cells. If they have a rigid cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, they might be plant cells. If they are irregular in shape and lack a nucleus, they could be prokaryotic cells. If they have a nucleus and are part of the immune system, they could be white blood cells. Please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist you further.",
