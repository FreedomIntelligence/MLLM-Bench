    "answer": " Based on the current motion of the vehicles, we can predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. Let's assume Vehicle A is moving at a constant speed of 10 m/s, and Vehicle B is moving at a constant speed of 15 m/s. Also, let's assume the vehicles are initially 50 meters apart, and they are heading towards each other on a straight road.\n\nTrajectory prediction for the next few seconds:\n\n1. After 1 second:\n   - Vehicle A will have traveled 10 meters (10 m/s * 1 s).\n   - Vehicle B will have traveled 15 meters (15 m/s * 1 s).\n   - The distance between the two vehicles will be 25 meters (50 - 10 - 15).\n\n2. After 2 seconds:\n   - Vehicle A will have traveled 20 meters (10 m/s * 2 s).\n   - Vehicle B will have traveled 30 meters (15 m/s * 2 s).\n   - The distance between the two vehicles will be 0 meters (50 - 20 - 30).\n\nTo avoid a collision, drivers can take the following actions:\n\n1. Vehicle A:\n   - Slow down: Reduce speed to allow more time for reaction and avoid a collision.\n   - Change lanes: If there is another lane in the same direction, change lanes to avoid the oncoming vehicle.\n   - Apply brakes: If the collision is imminent, apply brakes to reduce the impact force.\n\n2. Vehicle B:\n   - Slow down: Reduce speed to allow more time for reaction and avoid a collision.\n   - Change lanes: If there is another lane in the same direction, change lanes to avoid the oncoming vehicle.\n   - Apply brakes: If the collision is imminent, apply brakes to reduce the impact force.\n\nIn summary, both drivers should try to slow down, change lanes if possible, or apply brakes to avoid a collision. It is essential to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and stay alert to potential hazards on the road.",
