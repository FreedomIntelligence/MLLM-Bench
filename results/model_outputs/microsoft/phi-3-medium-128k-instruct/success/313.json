    "answer": " One possible combination to derive the numerical number found in the upper-left corner of the image (let's assume it's 123) is:\n\nHexagon: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nRounded square: +, *, -\n\nCombination: 1 * 2 * 3 + 4 - 5 = 123\n\nExplanation:\n1 * 2 * 3 = 6\n6 + 4 = 10\n10 - 5 = 5\n\nThis does not give us 123 as the result, so let's try another combination:\n\nCombination: 12 * 3 + 4 - 5 = 123\n\nExplanation:\n12 * 3 = 36\n36 + 4 = 40\n40 - 5 = 35\n\nThis still does not give us 123 as the result.
