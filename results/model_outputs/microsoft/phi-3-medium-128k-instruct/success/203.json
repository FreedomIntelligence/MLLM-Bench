Assuming that the cooler is organized in a grid pattern with the temperature readout at the top, we could infer the beverage below it based on the layout. If the beverages are arranged alphabetically or by type (e.g., sodas, juices, waters), the beverage directly below the temperature readout would be the next in sequence. Without additional context, it is not possible to determine which specific beverage is located below the temperature readout.",
