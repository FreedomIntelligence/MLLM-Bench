However, if we assume the dancers are wearing traditional Indian attire (like sarees for women and kurta pajamas for men) and performing intricate footwork with hand gestures, the dance style could likely be Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance. If the dancers are wearing flowing dresses and performing smooth, graceful movements, it could be ballet. If the dancers are wearing loose-fitting clothes and performing rhythmic, hip-oriented movements, it could be hip-hop or contemporary dance. More specific details would be needed to accurately identify the dance style.",
