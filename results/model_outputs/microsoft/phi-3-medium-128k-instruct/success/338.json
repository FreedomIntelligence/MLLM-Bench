    "answer": " The disaster type in question is a major earthquake. Earthquakes are natural disasters that occur when the Earth's crust experiences a sudden release of energy, resulting in seismic waves that cause the ground to shake. The impact of a major earthquake on structural and environmental health can be significant and multifaceted.\n\n**Impact on Structural Health:**\n\n1. Building Damage: Earthquakes can cause severe damage to buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure. The degree of damage depends on the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicenter, the type of soil, and the quality of construction. Buildings may suffer from cracked walls, collapsed roofs, or even complete structural failure.\n\n2. Infrastructure Disruption: Earthquakes can disrupt essential infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, and power lines. This can lead to transportation issues, power outages, and communication breakdowns, hampering rescue and recovery efforts.\n\n3. Hazardous Materials: Damaged buildings and infrastructure can release hazardous materials such as asbestos, lead, or chemicals, posing health risks to people and the environment.\n\n4. Fire and Gas Leaks: Earthquakes can cause fires and gas leaks, which can lead to further damage and pose additional risks to people and the environment.\n\n**Impact on Environmental Health:**\n\n1. Landslides and Avalanches: Earthquakes can trigger landslides and avalanches, which can bury homes, roads, and other infrastructure. These events can also damage ecosystems and disrupt habitats.\n\n2. Soil Liquefaction: In areas with loose, water-saturated soil, earthquakes can cause soil liquefaction, where the soil temporarily loses its strength and behaves like a liquid. This can cause buildings and infrastructure to sink or tilt, and can also disrupt ecosystems.\n\n3. Water Contamination: Earthquakes can cause water contamination by damaging water treatment facilities, releasing hazardous materials, or causing landslides that disrupt water sources. This can pose risks to human health and the environment.\n\n4. Ecosystem Disruption: Earthquakes can disrupt ecosystems by causing landslides, altering water sources, and damaging habitats. This can lead to the loss of biodiversity and the disruption of ecological processes.\n\nIn summary, a major earthquake can have a significant impact on both structural and environmental health. The extent of the damage depends on various factors, including the earthquake's magnitude, location, and the quality of construction and infrastructure in the affected area.",
