The shark receives cleaning service from these fish, which is why the latter are not attacked.\n4. Categorize the relationship as symbiosis.",

    "answer": " The interaction between the shark and the smaller fish swimming near it can be seen as a form of mutualism, specifically commensalism. In this scenario, the smaller fish, often referred to as cleaner fish, are not attacked by the shark because they provide a cleaning service by eating parasites and dead tissue off the shark's skin. This relationship is beneficial to the shark as it helps to keep them healthy and free from infections.\n\nThe smaller fish benefit from this relationship by gaining a source of food and protection, as the presence of the shark deters potential predators. The shark, on the other hand, benefits from the cleaning service provided by the smaller fish, which helps to maintain its health and well-being.\n\nThis type of interaction can be categorized as commensalism, as the smaller fish benefit from the relationship without causing any harm to the shark. The shark does not receive any direct benefits from the smaller fish, but it also does not suffer any harm, making this a mutually beneficial relationship for both species involved.",
