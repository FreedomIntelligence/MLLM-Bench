    "answer": " Let's analyze the correctness of each equation one by one:\n\n1. 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6\nThis equation is correct. It follows the distributive property of multiplication over addition, which states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6.\n\n2. 3(x - 2) = 3x - 6\nThis equation is also correct. It follows the same distributive property as the first equation. Thus, 3(x - 2) = 3x - 6.\n\n3. 4(x + 5) = 4x + 20\nThis equation is correct as well. It follows the distributive property of multiplication over addition. So, 4(x + 5) = 4x + 20.\n\n4. 5(x - 3) = 5x - 15\nThis equation is correct. It follows the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction, which states that a(b - c) = ab - ac. So, 5(x - 3) = 5x - 15.\n\n5. 6(x + 4) = 6x + 24\nThis equation is correct. It follows the distributive property of multiplication over addition. So, 6(x + 4) = 6x + 24.\n\nAll five equations are correct.",
