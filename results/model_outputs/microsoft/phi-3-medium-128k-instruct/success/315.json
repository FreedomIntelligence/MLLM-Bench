    "answer": " Let's simplify the equation 2x + 3x - 5 = 10.\n\nStep 1: Combine like terms\nThe equation has two terms with the variable x (2x and 3x). Combine them to get:\n5x - 5 = 10\n\nStep 2: Isolate the variable\nAdd 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable x:\n5x = 15\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nDivide both sides of the equation by 5 to find the value of x:\nx = 3\n\nSo, the simplified form of the equation is x = 3.",
