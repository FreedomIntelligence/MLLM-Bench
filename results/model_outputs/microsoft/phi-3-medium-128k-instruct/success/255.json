    "answer": " Upon examining the illustration of the big cats, we can identify several species-specific features that distinguish them from one another. Here are the main differences:\n\n1. Size: The first noticeable difference is the size of the big cats. The lion, for example, is the largest of the big cats, followed by the tiger, leopard, jaguar, and cheetah.\n\n2. Fur pattern: Each big cat species has a unique fur pattern that helps them blend into their environment. Lions have a golden-yellow coat with a faint tinge of brown and a distinctive mane around their necks. Tigers have bold black stripes on a reddish-orange coat, while leopards have a rosette pattern of black spots on a yellowish-brown coat. Jaguars have larger, more solid black spots known as rosettes, and cheetahs have a distinctive black tear stripe running down from their eyes.\n\n3. Facial features: The big cats also have distinct facial features. Lions have a broad, flat face with a short muzzle, while tigers have a more elongated face with a longer muzzle. Leopards have a more rounded face with a shorter muzzle, while jaguars have a broader, flatter face with a shorter muzzle. Cheetahs have a distinctive facial appearance with high-set eyes, small rounded ears, and a black tear stripe running down their face.\n\n4. Tail: The tails of the big cats also differ. Lions have a short, tufted tail, while tigers have a long, thick tail with a distinctive white tip. Leopards have a long, slender tail with a black tip, while jaguars have a short, thick tail with a black tip. Cheetahs have a long, slender tail with black spots.\n\n5. Habitat: Each big cat species is adapted to a specific habitat. Lions are found in grasslands and savannas, while tigers inhabit forests and grasslands. Leopards are adaptable and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and mountains. Jaguars are primarily found in tropical rainforests, and cheetahs inhabit grasslands and savannas.\n\n6. Hunting style: The big cats also have different hunting styles. Lions are social animals that hunt in groups, while tigers are solitary hunters. Leopards are solitary hunters that often stalk their prey, while jaguars are ambush predators that rely on their powerful jaws to kill their prey. Cheetahs are known for their incredible speed and use their speed to chase down their prey.\n\nBy examining these species-specific features, we can identify and differentiate between the big cats in the illustration.",
