    "answer": " If the container in the top left corner is filled with boiling water at 100째C, yes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle directly. Boiling water can cause severe burns upon contact with skin. The severity of the burns depends on the duration of contact and the amount of water that spills onto the skin. It is always recommended to handle hot containers with caution and use appropriate protective gear, such as oven mitts or heat-resistant gloves, to prevent scalding injuries.",
