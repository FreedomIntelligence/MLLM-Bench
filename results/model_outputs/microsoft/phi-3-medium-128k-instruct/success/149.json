The right image, on the other hand, exaggerates this challenge by depicting the same person grappling with a giant jar, almost the size of a building. This hyperbole is humorous because it takes a common, relatable frustration (struggling to open a jar, typically, a small jar) and escalates it to an absurdly large scale. The humor comes from the ridiculousness of the situation, as it'situates a simple, everyday problem into a Herculean task.",
