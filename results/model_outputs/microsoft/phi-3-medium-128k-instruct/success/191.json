Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.5 g/dL (Normal range: 12.0-15.5 g/dL for females and 13.5-17.5 g/dL for males)\n2. White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 18,000/mm³ (Normal range: 4,500-11,000/mm³)\n3. Platelet count: 350,000/mm³ (Normal range: 150,000-450,000/mm³)\n\nBased on these abnormal values, a possible diagnosis could be anemia, which is indicated by the low Hemoglobin level. The elevated White Blood Cell count suggests an infection or inflammation. The platelet count is within the normal range.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other laboratory results to make a more accurate diagnosis. Further investigations, such as a complete blood count with differential, blood smear, or additional tests, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of these abnormal values.",
