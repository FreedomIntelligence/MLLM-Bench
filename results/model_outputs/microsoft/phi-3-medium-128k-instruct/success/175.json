    "answer": " To place the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in a visually appealing and understandable location, you can consider placing it near the center of the image. Since the image has dimensions 675x900, you can calculate the center coordinates as follows:\n\nCenter X coordinate = (Width / 2) = (675 / 2) = 337.5\nCenter Y coordinate = (Height / 2) = (900 / 2) = 450\n\nSo, the approximate coordinates for placing the sign would be (337.5, 450). However, depending on the context and design of the image, you may want to adjust the position slightly. For example, if the lemons are displayed at the bottom of the image, you might want to place the sign slightly above the lemons to draw attention to the offer.",
