However, I can provide you with general information about sockets and their functionalities.\n\nIn the context of electrical systems, a socket is a device that allows electrical devices to be connected to a power supply. There are different types of sockets, which can be identified by their shapes, sizes, and the number of pins or prongs they have. Here are some common types of sockets and their functionalities:\n\n1. Type A (NEMA 1-15): This is the standard socket found in North America. It has two flat parallel pins and is used for low-power devices such as lamps, televisions, and small appliances. It provides 120 volts at 60 Hz.\n\n2. Type B (NEMA 10-30): This socket has two flat parallel pins and a grounding pin. It is typically used for high-power devices like electric ranges and dryers, providing 240 volts at 60 Hz.\n\n3. Type C (NEMA 5-15): This socket, also known as a NEMA 5-15P, has two flat parallel pins and is commonly used for standard wall outlets in homes and businesses. It provides 120 volts at 60 Hz.\n\n4. Type E (CEE 7/4): This socket is found in Europe and features two round pins and a grounding pin. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n5. Type F (CEE 7/7): Also known as Schuko, this socket is used in Europe and features two round pins and a grounding clip. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n6. Type G (BS 1363): This socket is used in the United Kingdom and features three rectangular pins. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n7. Type I (AS/NZS 3112): This socket is used in Australia, New Zealand, and China. It has two flat pins and a grounding pin. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n8. Type J (SANS 164-1): This socket is used in South Africa and features two round pins and a grounding pin. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n9. Type K (BS 1363-5): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices like electric stoves and provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n10. Type N (NBR 14136): This socket is used in Brazil and features two flat pins and a grounding pin. It provides 220 volts at 60 Hz.\n\n11. Type L (CEI 23-16): This socket is used in Italy and features three round pins. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n12. Type M (AS/NZS 3112): This socket is used in New Zealand and features two flat pins and a grounding pin. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n13. Type N (CEI 23-16): This socket is used in Europe and features two flat pins and a grounding pin. It provides 230 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n14. Type O (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices like industrial appliances. It provides 415 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n15. Type P (NEMA 1-30): This socket has two flat parallel pins and a grounding pin. It is used for 240-volt appliances in the US.\n\n16. Type Q (NEMA 1-30R): This socket has two flat parallel pins and a grounding pin. It is used for 240-volt appliances in the US.\n\n17. Type S (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\n18. Type U (CEE 7/6): This socket is used in Europe and features two round pins and a grounding pin. It provides 400 volts at 50 Hz.\n\n19. Type UL (NEMA 10-30R): This socket has two flat parallel pins and a grounding pin. It is used for high-power devices in the US.\n\n20. Type V (NEMA 14-30): This socket has three flat parallel pins and a grounding pin. It is used for high-power devices like dryers and electric ranges in the US.\n\n21. Type W (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\n22. Type X (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\n23. Type Y (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\n24. Type Y (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\n25. Type Z (BS 546): This socket is used in the UK for high-power devices. It has three round pins.\n\nRemember that the voltage and frequency may vary depending on the country and region. Always ensure that the device you are connecting is compatible with the socket and the power supply in the area where you are using it. It's also essential to use the correct adapter or converter if you are traveling or moving to a different country.",
