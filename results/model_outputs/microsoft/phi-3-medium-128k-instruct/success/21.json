    "answer": " The image shows a person performing the \"Bicep Curl\" exercise. This exercise primarily targets the biceps brachii, a muscle located in the upper arm.\n\nTechnical Essentials:\n\n1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing forward and elbows close to the torso.\n2. Keep your upper arms stationary, exhale, and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. The forearms should move, but the upper arms should remain still.\n3. Continue to raise the weights until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment.\n4. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\nImportant Tips:\n\n- Keep your elbows close to your sides and avoid swinging the weights.\n- Maintain a slight bend in your knees and engage your core muscles for stability.\n- Use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with proper form and control.",
