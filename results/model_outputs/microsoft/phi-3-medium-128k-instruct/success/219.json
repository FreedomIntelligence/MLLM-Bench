However, I can provide a general approach on how to find this information.\n\nA heat map is a data visualization tool that uses color to represent the values of a matrix or data set. In the context of metal prices, the heat map might show the price change of various metals over a certain period.\n\nHere is a general approach to find the metal with the biggest price change:\n\n1. Look for each metal, identify the color that represents its price change. The color scheme should be different depending on the heat map (for example, red could mean a decrease or increase, blue could mean a decrease).\n\n2. Compare the color intensities consistent across the heat map? If they are, then compare the color intensities directly.\n\n3. If the color scheme (e.g., darker colors might represent larger price changes.\n\nOnce you've identified the color scheme, look for each metal, identify the color that represents its price change.\n\n4. Compare the color intensities across all metals. The metal with the darkest or most intense color-colored cell (depending on the color scheme) is likely to have the biggest price change.\n\nRemember, this is just a general approach.
