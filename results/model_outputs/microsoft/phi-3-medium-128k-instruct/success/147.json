Max, on the other hand, is more interested in chasing squirrels and playing fetch than solving math problems.\n\nOne day, Emily decides to have some fun with Max and dresses him up in a graduation cap and gown. She places him in front of her chalkboard and, with a twinkle in her eye, writes \"Math\" and \"Fail\" on it. She takes a picture of Max with the chalkboard and shares it on social media, captioning it, \"Max's first day of college!\"\n\nThe image quickly goes viral, with people all over the world laughing at Max's adorable and humorous graduation photo. Emily decides to turn the meme into a series, with Max attending different classes, such as \"Science\" and \"History,\" always with a \"Fail\" message on the chalkboard.\n\nAs the memes continue to spread, Max becomes a celebrity, and Emily starts receiving offers to create merchandise with Max's pictures. Despite the fame, Max remains the same lovable, mischievous dog he always was, and Emily continues to share their humorous adventures with the world.",
