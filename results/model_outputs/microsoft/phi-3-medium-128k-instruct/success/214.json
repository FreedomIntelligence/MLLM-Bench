    "answer": " Based on the scatter plot, there appears to be a negative correlation between the vaccination rate and excess deaths. As the vaccination rate increases, the number of excess deaths decreases. This suggests that higher vaccination rates are associated with lower excess deaths.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with an 85% vaccination rate, we can use the trend line or a line of best fit drawn on the scatter plot. Let's assume that the line of best fit shows a linear relationship between the two variables. If we find a point on the line corresponding to an 85% vaccination rate, we can estimate the excess deaths.\n\nFor example, if the line of best fit passes through the point (85, 50) on the scatter plot, it would suggest that a state with an 85% vaccination rate might have around 50 excess deaths.\n\nHowever, please note that this is an estimation based on the trend observed in the scatter plot and the actual value may vary depending on other factors not included in the plot. Additionally, the relationship might not be perfectly linear, and the prediction might not be exact. It's always essential to consider other factors that could influence excess deaths, such as population density, healthcare access, and the prevalence of underlying conditions in the population.",
