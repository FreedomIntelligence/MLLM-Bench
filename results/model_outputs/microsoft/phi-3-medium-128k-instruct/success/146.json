    "answer": " The cat's expression in the meme is exaggerated to an extreme degree, showcasing an almost comically disproportionate level of surprise or shock. This hyperbole is a common technique used in humor to amplify the reaction to a situation, making it absurd and therefore funny. The exaggerated facial features, such as bulging eyes and a wide-open mouth, are not typical of a real cat's expression but are instantly recognizable as a human's exaggerated response to surprise. This anthropomorphism, or attributing human traits to an animal, creates a humorous contrast and plays on the audience's expectations. The humor is further enhanced by the context in which the cat's expression is used, often relating to everyday situations that are relatable to the audience. The hyperbole in the cat's expression thus serves to magnify the mundane, transforming it into something laughably extreme.",
