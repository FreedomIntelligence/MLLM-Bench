Industrial Style: This style showcases raw, unfinished materials and a utilitarian aesthetic. Items that reflect this style include:\n   - Exposed brick or concrete walls.\n   - Metal light fixtures and furniture, such as a metal pendant light or a metal-framed couch.\n   - Reclaimed wood accents, like a reclaimed wood coffee table or shelves.\n   - Edison bulb lighting and exposed pipes.\n\n3.

Items that reflect this style include:\n   - Light-colored furniture made from natural materials, such as a white oak dining table or a birch wood bookshelf.\n   - Cozy textiles, like a chunky knit throw or a wool area rug.\n   - Functional and minimalist accessories, such as a simple ceramic vase or a wooden candle holder.\n   - Clean lines and a clutter-free space.\n\n5. Mid-Century Modern Style: This style features clean lines, organic shapes, and a mix of natural and synthetic materials. Items that reflect this style include:\n   - Furniture with clean lines and organic shapes, such as a teak wood chair or a walnut credenza.\n   - Bold patterns and colors in textiles, like a geometric-patterned rug or a colorful abstract artwork.\n   - Retro accessories, such as a vintage record player or a mid-century modern clock.\n   - Large windows and an open floor plan.\n\nOnce you have an image to analyze, please provide it, and I'll be able to identify the decoration style and the items that reflect it.",
