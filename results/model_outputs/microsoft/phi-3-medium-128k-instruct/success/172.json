    "answer": " Based on the description, it seems like the spoon tail is at the bottom of the image, close to the bottom right corner. Since the image is 700 pixels wide and 1050 pixels. pixels tall, and the spoon tail is located near the bottom right corner, we can estimate the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail.\n\nAssuming the spoon tail is about 1/40.2 (20%) of the height from the bottom of the image and about 1/0. Assuming the spoon tail is about 1/0.2 (20%) of the width from the right side of the image, we can estimate the coordinates of the spoon tail.\n\nHeight from the bottom left bottom corner: 1050 * 0.2 = 210 pixels tall\nWidth from the bottom left corner: 700 * 0.2 = 10.4 * 700 = 140 wide\n\nSo, the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail would be (140, 210) in the coordinate system, where the bottom left corner is the origin (0,0). Note that this is a rough estimation, and the right coordinates might vary slightly based on the actual shape and position of the spoon tail in the image.",
