This scenario is likely the result of an avalanche occurring while the vehicle was traveling through a snow-covered area. Avalanches can be triggered by various factors, including natural events like earthquakes or snow accumulation, or human activities such as snowmobiling or skiing. In this case, the vehicle was caught in the aftermath of the avalanche, which is a common occurrence in mountainous regions where such natural phenomena are more frequent.",
