    "answer": "To infer future automotive design evolution from current trends, we need to analyze the current design trends in the automotive industry. Some of the key trends include:\n\n1. **Electric and Hybrid Vehicles**: The increasing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles indicates a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly designs. This trend is likely to continue, with more advancements in battery technology and increased demand for electric vehicles.\n\n2. **Autonomous Driving**: The development of autonomous driving technology is reshaping the automotive industry. Designs are becoming more minimalist, with fewer external features like mirrors and steering wheels, as these are no longer necessary for autonomous vehicles.\n\n3. **Connected Cars**: The integration of internet connectivity into vehicles is becoming more common. This trend is likely to continue, with more advanced features like in-vehicle navigation, entertainment systems, and safety features that are wirelessly connected to the internet.\n\n4. **Sustainable Materials**: There is a growing trend towards using sustainable materials in vehicle design, such as recycled plastics, biodegradable materials, and lightweight materials like carbon fiber. This trend is likely to continue, with more focus on reducing the environmental impact of automotive manufacturing.\n\n5. **Personalized Design**: Consumers are increasingly looking for personalized vehicles that reflect their individual styles and preferences. This trend is likely to continue, with more customization options available for exterior and interior design.\n\n6. **Performance and Efficiency**: There is a growing focus on improving vehicle performance and efficiency, with more advanced engine technologies and aerodynamic designs. This trend is likely to continue, with more emphasis on fuel efficiency and performance.\n\n7. **Safety Features**: The inclusion of advanced safety features, such as lane departure warning systems and automatic emergency braking, is becoming more common. This trend is likely to continue, with more focus on improving overall vehicle safety.\n\nBy analyzing these current trends, we can infer that future automotive design evolution will likely focus on sustainability, connectivity, autonomous driving, personalized design, performance, efficiency, and safety.",
