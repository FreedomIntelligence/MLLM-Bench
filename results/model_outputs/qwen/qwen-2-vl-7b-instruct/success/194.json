    "answer": "This ECG image shows a 12-lead ECG with standard leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) and augmented limb leads (V1, V2, V3). The ECG is recorded with a paper speed of 25 mm/s and a voltage sensitivity of 1 mV/mm.\n\n### ECG Waveforms and Abnormalities:\n\n1. **P Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Small, upright in leads II, III, and aVF, and negative in aVR.\n   - **Abnormality:** The P waves are generally normal in this ECG.\n\n2. **QRS Complex:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Normal in shape and duration (typically < 0.12 seconds).\n   - **Abnormality:** The QRS complexes are normal in this ECG.\n\n3. **T Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** The T waves are generally upright and symmetrical.\n   - **Abnormality:** The T waves are generally normal in this ECG.\n\n4. **U Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Sometimes visible but not always present.\n   - **Abnormality:** The U waves are generally not present in this ECG.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- **Heart Rate:** The heart rate is within normal limits.\n- **Rhythm:** The rhythm appears to be regular.\n- **Axis:** The QRS axis is normal, indicating the direction of electrical depolarization of the ventricles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities in the P, QRS, or T waves. The heart rate and rhythm are within normal limits. There are no signs of atrial or ventricular abnormalities, and the ECG is consistent with a healthy heart.",
