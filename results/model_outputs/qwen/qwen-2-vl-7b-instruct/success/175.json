    "answer": "To determine the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\", we need to consider the overall layout of the image and the position of the sign relative to the other objects.\n\n1. The sign is located on the right side of the image.\n2. The sign is above the lemons, which are stacked in a specific arrangement.\n3. The sign is likely to be placed above the lemons, possibly on a shelf or a stand.\n\nAssuming the image is a top-down view and the lemons are stacked in a way that they are easily visible from above, the coordinates of the sign can be estimated as follows:\n\n- The top left corner of the image is at (0,900), and the bottom right corner is at (675,0).\n- The sign is likely to be located in the upper part of the image, possibly around the middle or slightly higher.\n\nA rough estimate for the coordinates of the sign might be around (350, 600). This is a rough estimate and may not be exact, but it gives a general idea of where the sign is located in the image.",
