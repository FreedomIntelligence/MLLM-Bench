    "answer": "The trend of change in the predicted graph shows a gradual increase in the number of figures with obesity over time. Here are the reasons for this trend:\n\n1. **Increased Sedentary Lifestyle**: In the modern world, there has been a significant shift towards a more sedentary lifestyle. People spend more time sitting, either at work or while watching TV, which can lead to weight gain.\n\n2. **Unhealthy Eating Habits**: The availability of processed and high-calorie foods has increased, and people often consume more calories than they need. This can lead to weight gain, especially if combined with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n3. **Genetic Predisposition**: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to obesity, which can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n4. **Environmental Factors**: The built environment, such as the lack of parks and green spaces, can make it harder for people to engage in physical activity. Additionally, the availability of fast food and convenience stores can make it easier to consume unhealthy foods.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**: Stress, anxiety, and depression can all contribute to weight gain. People may turn to food as a coping mechanism, leading to increased calorie intake and weight gain.\n\n6. **Lack of Physical Activity**: With the rise of technology, people often use electronic devices instead of engaging in physical activities. This can lead to a decrease in physical activity levels, which is a major contributor to obesity.\n\n7. **Economic Factors**: In some cases, obesity can be linked to economic factors, such as the cost of healthy food or the availability of affordable, unhealthy options.\n\nThese factors combined have led to a significant increase in obesity rates worldwide, as depicted in the graph.",
