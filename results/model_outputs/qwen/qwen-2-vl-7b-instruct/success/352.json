The following points support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Consistency in Shadows and Lighting**: The shadows and lighting in the photo appear consistent and natural, indicating that the photo has not been altered.\n2. **Realistic Colors and Textures**: The colors of the objects, such as the red squirrel, the pavement, and the road, are realistic and consistent with what one would expect to see in a natural setting.\n3. **No Visible Artefacts**: There are no visible artefacts or inconsistencies that would suggest the photo has been edited, such as unnatural colors, textures, or distortions.\n\nOverall, the photo appears to be a genuine representation of a scene without any evidence of editing.",
