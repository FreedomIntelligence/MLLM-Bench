The presence of numerous rescue workers suggests that the disaster has been ongoing for a significant period, allowing for extensive search and rescue efforts. The intensity of the disaster appears to be severe, as evidenced by the complete destruction of buildings and the large scale of debris. The damage pattern indicates that the disaster likely occurred over a short period but with high impact, potentially due to a natural disaster such as a hurricane, earthquake, or large-scale explosion.",
