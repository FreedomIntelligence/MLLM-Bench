    "answer": "To prove that triangle \\( PUQ \\) is congruent to triangle \\( PSR \\), we can use the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the sides of the triangles:**\n   - In triangle \\( PQR \\), \\( PQ = QR = PR \\) because it is an equilateral triangle.\n   - In triangle \\( PUS \\), \\( PU = US = PS \\) because it is an equilateral triangle.\n\n2. **Analyze the overlapping triangles:**\n   - Triangle \\( PUS \\) can be divided into two triangles: \\( PUQ \\) and \\( USR \\).\n   - Triangle \\( PQR \\) can be divided into two triangles: \\( PSR \\) and \\( PQR \\).\n\n3. **Compare the sides of the triangles:**\n   - \\( PQ = PU \\) because both are sides of the equilateral triangle \\( PQR \\).\n   - \\( QR = US \\) because both are sides of the equilateral triangle \\( PUS \\).\n   - \\( PR = SR \\) because both are sides of the equilateral triangle \\( PQR \\).\n\n4. **Apply the SSS congruence criterion:**\n   - Since \\( PQ = PU \\), \\( QR = US \\), and \\( PR = SR \\), all corresponding sides of the two triangles \\( PUQ \\) and \\( PSR \\) are equal.\n   - Therefore, by the SSS congruence criterion, triangle \\( PUQ \\) is congruent to triangle \\( PSR \\).\n\nHence, we have proven that triangle \\( PUQ \\) is congruent to triangle \\( PSR \\).",
