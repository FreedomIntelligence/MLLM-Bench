    "answer": "The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between the vaccination rate and excess deaths. As the vaccination rate increases, the excess deaths decrease. The line of best fit has a slope of approximately -0.59, indicating a moderate negative relationship.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can use the line of best fit. The equation of the line of best fit can be approximated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = \\text{Intercept} - 0.59 \\times \\text{Vaccination Rate} \\]\n\nGiven that the slope is -0.59 and assuming the intercept is around 40 (as the line of best fit intersects the y-axis near this value), we can estimate the excess deaths as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 40 - 0.59 \\times 85 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 40 - 49.65 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} \\approx -9.65 \\]\n\nSince the number of excess deaths cannot be negative, we can interpret this as the state having approximately 9 excess deaths less than expected based on the vaccination rate. Therefore, for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we predict approximately 9 fewer excess deaths compared to a state with a lower vaccination rate.",
