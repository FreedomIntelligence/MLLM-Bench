    "answer": "The people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from a sandstorm. Sandstorms are a type of dust storm that occurs in arid and semi-arid regions, where loose sand and dust are lifted into the air by strong winds. The sand and dust particles are carried by the wind, creating a cloud of debris that can be extremely dangerous for humans and animals. \n\nThe veils serve as a barrier to protect the people's faces from the sand and dust particles, which can cause irritation, respiratory problems, and even blindness if inhaled. The veils also help to keep the people's clothing and hair from being blown away by the strong winds.\n\nIn addition to protecting themselves from the sandstorm, the people in the picture are also using donkeys and carts to transport themselves and their belongings. This is a common practice in arid and semi-arid regions where donkeys and carts are used for transportation due to the lack of infrastructure and the difficulty of navigating the terrain with vehicles.",
