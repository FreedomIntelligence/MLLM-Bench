The central figure is using a pickaxe, which is a tool typically used for breaking up hard rocks or earth. The other two figures are seated and appear to be handling smaller tools, possibly shovels or picks, which are also common in mining operations.\n\nBased on these observations, it is likely that the individuals are miners or construction workers involved in excavation or mining activities. The presence of the pickaxe and the posture of the central figure suggest that they are engaged in manual labor, possibly extracting minerals or rocks from the ground.",
