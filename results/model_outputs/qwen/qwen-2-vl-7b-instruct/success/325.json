    "answer": "To improve the quality of the image, you can consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Lighting**: Ensure that the image is well-lit, especially in the foreground and background. Adequate lighting can help to reveal more details and enhance the overall visual appeal.\n\n2. **Composition**: Pay attention to the composition of the image. Ensure that the main subject (the house) is well-framed and that the background does not distract from the main focus.\n\n3. **Focus**: Make sure that the image is in focus. A slightly blurred image can detract from the quality, so focus on capturing sharp details.\n\n4. **Noise Reduction**: If the image has a lot of noise, consider using noise reduction techniques in post-processing to improve the clarity and smoothness of the image.\n\n5. **Post-Processing**: Use image editing software to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color balance. This can help to enhance the overall appearance of the image.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, you can improve the quality of the image and make it more visually appealing.",
