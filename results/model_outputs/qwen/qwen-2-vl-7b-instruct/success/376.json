    "answer": "To implement data visualization based on the data in the table, you can use various types of charts and graphs that are effective for displaying percentage data over time. Here are some suggestions for visualizations:\n\n1. **Bar Chart**: Use a horizontal bar chart to compare the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state across the different Finance Commissions. This will allow you to easily see the changes in allocation for each state over time.\n\n2. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Create a stacked bar chart to show the overall trend of union taxes and duties allocated to all states combined, with each Finance Commission represented as a separate bar. This will help in understanding the total trend and how it changes over time.\n\n3. **Line Chart**: Use a line chart to show the percentage share of each state over time. This will help in visualizing the trend for each state and how it compares to others.\n\n4. **Heat Map**: Create a heat map to show the percentage share of union taxes and duties for each state over the different Finance Commissions. This will help in quickly identifying which states have received the highest and lowest shares over time.\n\n5. **Treemap**: Use a treemap to display the percentage share of each state over the different Finance Commissions. This will help in visualizing the allocation in a hierarchical structure, which can be useful for understanding the relative shares.\n\n6. **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between the percentage share of union taxes and duties and the Finance Commission number. This can help in identifying any trends or patterns in the data.\n\n7. **Gantt Chart**: If you want to focus on the timeline aspect, a Gantt chart can be used to show the percentage share of union taxes and duties for each state over the different Finance Commissions.\n\nChoose the visualization that best suits the data and the insights you want to communicate. For example, if you want to compare the shares across states, a bar chart or a stacked bar chart might be the best choice. If you want to see the trend over time, a line chart or a heat map would be more appropriate.",
