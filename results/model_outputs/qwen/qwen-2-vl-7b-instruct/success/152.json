    "answer": "The couple's attire in the image represents specific regional wedding traditions, which can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Groom's Attire:**\n   - **Sherwani:** The groom is wearing a Sherwani, which is a traditional long coat or jacket worn by men during weddings. It is often made of fine fabrics like silk or brocade and is embellished with intricate embroidery and beadwork. The Sherwani is typically worn over a white kurta and churidar (tight-fitting trousers).\n   - **Headgear:** The groom is wearing a red and gold turban, known as a Pagdi or Pagdi Safa. It is a traditional headpiece worn by men in many Indian regions, especially in Punjab and parts of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n2. **Bride's Attire:**\n   - **Lehenga:** The bride is wearing a Lehenga, which is a traditional Indian skirt worn over a blouse and paired with a dupatta (stole). The Lehenga is often made of silk or cotton and is adorned with intricate embroidery, beadwork, and mirror work.\n   - **Blouse and Dupatta:** The blouse is typically made of chiffon or georgette and is designed to complement the Lehenga. The dupatta is a long, rectangular piece of fabric that is draped over the shoulders and is often used for added warmth or as a decorative element.\n\nThese traditional attires are deeply rooted in Indian culture and are commonly worn during weddings across various regions. The Sherwani and Lehenga are iconic symbols of Indian weddings, representing the couple's cultural heritage and the joyous occasion of their union.",
