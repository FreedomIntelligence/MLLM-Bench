This type of test is commonly referred to as an antigen test or an antigen rapid test.\n\nThe two lines on the test kit have the following meanings:\n1. The first line (C line) is a control line. It indicates that the test has been performed correctly. The presence of this line is essential for the test to be valid.\n2. The second line (T line) is the test line. It indicates a positive result for COVID-19 antigens. The presence of this line suggests that the person tested is likely infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nIn the image, there is only one line visible in the test area, which means the test result is negative, indicating that no COVID-19 antigens were detected in the sample.",
