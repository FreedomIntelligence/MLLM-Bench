    "answer": "Structural damage within a building, as indicated by signs of significant stress on interior walls, can be caused by several underlying reasons. These include:\n\n1. **Earthquakes**: Seismic activity can cause significant stress on building structures, leading to cracks and damage to walls and floors.\n\n2. **Expansive Soils**: Soils that expand when wet can put pressure on foundations and walls, causing cracks and structural failure.\n\n3. **Tectonic Movements**: Movement of the Earth's crust can cause cracks and damage to building structures, especially in areas prone to tectonic activity.\n\n4. **Construction Defects**: Poor construction techniques or materials can lead to structural weaknesses that become apparent over time, especially under stress.\n\n5. **Subsidence**: Settlement of the ground can cause cracks in walls and floors, especially in areas with soft soil or poor drainage.\n\n6. **Overloading**: Excessive weight on a building, such as from heavy equipment or additional floors, can cause structural damage.\n\n7. **Inadequate Maintenance**: Lack of proper maintenance can lead to structural weakening, especially in older buildings.\n\n8. **Environmental Factors**: Factors such as moisture, temperature changes, and chemical reactions can weaken building materials and cause structural damage.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a thorough inspection and, if necessary, professional intervention to stabilize and repair the structure.",
