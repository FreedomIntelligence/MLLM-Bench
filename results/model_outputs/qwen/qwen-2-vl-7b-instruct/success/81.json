Frying involves submerging the food in hot oil, which can be used to cook a variety of dishes, including bread and meat.\n\n3. **Toasting**: The bread buns are likely toasted, which involves heating them to a warm, soft, and slightly crispy state. This can be done by placing them in an oven or toaster.\n\nThese methods are commonly used in street food preparation to create a variety of dishes that are both tasty and visually appealing.",
