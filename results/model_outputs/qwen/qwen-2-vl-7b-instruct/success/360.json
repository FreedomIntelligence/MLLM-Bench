    "answer": "Once upon a time, in a cozy little room, there was a boy named Max. Max had a dream that was as big as the clouds that floated above his bed. In his dream, he was in a classroom, surrounded by his classmates and a mischievous dog.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Johnson, was standing at the front of the room, holding a piece of paper with the multiplication problem \"7 x 5 = 35\" written on it. Max was sitting at his desk, trying to solve the problem, while his classmates and the dog were laughing at his confusion.\n\nMax felt embarrassed and frustrated, but he didn't want to give up. He took a deep breath and tried to remember what his teacher had taught him about multiplication. He closed his eyes and visualized the problem in his mind, repeating the numbers over and over again until he finally found the answer.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he realized that he had solved the problem correctly. He felt a surge of pride and relief wash over him. He looked up at his classmates and the dog, who were now looking at him with admiration and respect.\n\nMax woke up from his dream, feeling happy and confident. He knew that he could solve any problem if he just kept trying and never gave up. From that day on, he approached each challenge with a positive attitude and a determination to succeed.",
