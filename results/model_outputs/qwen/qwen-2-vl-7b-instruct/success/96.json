    "answer": "The artwork in the image is a painting that belongs to the Cubist art movement. Cubism is characterized by the use of geometric shapes and fragmented forms to represent subjects. The painting features:\n\n1. **Geometric Shapes**: The faces are composed of simple geometric shapes, such as triangles, squares, and circles, which are used to represent the facial features.\n\n2. **Fragmentation**: The faces are not depicted in a traditional, continuous manner but are broken down into smaller, overlapping sections, creating a sense of depth and complexity.\n\n3. **Lack of Perspective**: The painting does not adhere to traditional perspective rules, allowing for multiple viewpoints and angles within the same image.\n\n4. **Color and Texture**: The use of vibrant, contrasting colors and bold, angular lines adds to the abstract quality of the artwork.\n\n5. **Abstract Representation**: The figures are depicted in a highly abstract manner, with simplified forms and minimal detail, focusing more on the structure and composition rather than realistic representation.\n\nThese stylistic features are indicative of the Cubist movement and suggest that the artist is likely associated with this school of art.",
