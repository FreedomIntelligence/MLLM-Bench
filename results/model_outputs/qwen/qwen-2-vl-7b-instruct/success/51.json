    "answer": "The building in the picture is the Great Wall of China. The construction of the Great Wall can be traced back to the 7th century BC, during the Spring and Autumn Period, when various states in what would later become China began building walls to protect themselves from invasions. Over the centuries, these walls were expanded and connected to form the Great Wall of China, which reached its peak during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The section of the wall shown in the picture is located in the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall, which is known for its well-preserved stone structures and scenic views.",
