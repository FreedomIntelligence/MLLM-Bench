However, without specific measurements such as the crown-rump length (CRL), it is not possible to accurately determine the gestational age of the fetus. To assess the gestational age, a healthcare professional would typically measure the CRL in millimeters and compare it to standardized growth charts. These charts provide expected ranges for CRL at different gestational ages.\n\nIf you have access to the CRL measurement from this scan, you can use it to estimate the gestational age. If not, please provide the CRL measurement, and I can help you interpret the results.",
