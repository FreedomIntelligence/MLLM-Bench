    "answer": "The container in the top left corner of the picture appears to be a thermos or insulated container. If filled with boiling water at 100째C, it could still retain that temperature for some time due to its insulated properties. However, whether people would be scalded if they held the bottle would depend on several factors, including the insulation's effectiveness, the duration for which the water remains hot, and the individual's reaction time.\n\nIn general, holding a container filled with boiling water for an extended period can cause severe burns, especially if the water is hot. Therefore, it is important to be cautious when handling such containers, especially if they are insulated and can retain heat for a while.",
