    "answer": "The humor in this meme is primarily slapstick. It employs a visual gag involving a dog and a human, creating a humorous contrast between their reactions and actions.\n\n1. **Contrast Between Characters**: The top panel shows a person saying \"Oh look at that dog\" while the other person responds with \"I hate dogs.\" This sets up a contrast between the person's curiosity and the other person's aversion, which is a common slapstick trope.\n\n2. **Unexpected Turn of Events**: In the bottom panel, the dog appears to be the one driving the car, which is an unexpected and absurd scenario. This is a classic slapstick element, as it reverses the roles and expectations, leading to a humorous and unexpected outcome.\n\n3. **Visual Juxtaposition**: The dog's expression, which looks smug and confident, juxtaposed with the human characters' expressions and reactions, adds to the humor. The dog's \"This is the way!\" line further emphasizes its confident and perhaps mischievous demeanor.\n\n4. **Textual Play**: The text \"NAFO OFAN\" at the bottom adds a layer of absurdity and confusion, which is typical in slapstick humor, as it often involves unexpected or nonsensical elements.\n\nOverall, the meme uses slapstick humor through the contrast of expectations, unexpected actions, and absurd visual elements.",
