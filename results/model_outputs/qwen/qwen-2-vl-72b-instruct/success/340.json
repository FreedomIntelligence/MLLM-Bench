While the image alone does not provide enough context to determine the presence of discrimination, it does show a tense scenario involving police and civilians. Discrimination, if present, would need to be assessed based on additional context, such as the circumstances leading up to the incident, the behavior of the officers and individuals involved, and any statements or evidence related to the event.
