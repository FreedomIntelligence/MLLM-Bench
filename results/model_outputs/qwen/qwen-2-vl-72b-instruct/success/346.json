This can reinforce stereotypes that women are less capable or less strong than men, which is not only inaccurate but also harmful. It perpetuates gender roles and undermines the idea that women are equally capable of handling everyday tasks. Such advertising can contribute to a broader societal view that undervalues women's abilities and reinforces gender inequality.",
