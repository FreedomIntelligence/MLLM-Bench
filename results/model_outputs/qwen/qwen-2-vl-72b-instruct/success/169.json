    "answer": "The instructions for how to properly open a new book are as follows:\n\n1. **Place the book with its back on a table.**\n2. **Let the front cover down.**\n3. **Then the back cover.**\n4. **Then open a few leaves in front.**\n5. **Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached.**\n6. **Do this two or three times in order to limber up the binding.**\n\nThe instructions emphasize the importance of not forcing the back cover and treating the book gently, comparing it to how a machine needs lubrication.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nThe instructions are clear and detailed, providing a step-by-step guide on how to open a new book without damaging it. The use of illustrations helps to visually demonstrate the process, making it easier to understand. The additional cautionary note about not forcing the back cover and the analogy to a machine needing lubrication further emphasize the importance of gentle handling. Overall, the instructions are effective in guiding someone on how to properly open a new book to preserve its binding and longevity.",
