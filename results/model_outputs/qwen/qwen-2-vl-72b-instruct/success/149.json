    "answer": "The visual metaphor in the right image exaggerates the challenge of the situation depicted in the left image by replacing the sleeping baby with a complex and delicate mechanism, such as a bomb. This hyperbole is humorous because it playfully amplifies the common parental experience of trying to avoid waking a sleeping baby. Instead of just being careful not to disturb the baby, the image suggests that the stakes are incredibly high, akin to defusing a bomb. This夸张的对比 creates a comedic effect by highlighting the exaggerated difficulty and delicacy of the situation, making it relatable and amusing to parents who have experienced the challenge of keeping a sleeping baby undisturbed.",
