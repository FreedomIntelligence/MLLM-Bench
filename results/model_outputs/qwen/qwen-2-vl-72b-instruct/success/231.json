    "answer": "The table provides data on night light intensity, average value per pixel, population density, urbanization percentage, and GDP per capita for the United States, Brazil, and Madagascar. To analyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita, we can compare the average night light intensity (average value per pixel) with the GDP per capita for each country.\n\n1. **United States**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 4.66\n   - GDP per capita: $33,582\n\n2. **Brazil**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 0.63\n   - GDP per capita: $3,760\n\n3. **Madagascar**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 0.02\n   - GDP per capita: $249\n\nFrom the data:\n- The United States has the highest average night light intensity (4.66) and the highest GDP per capita ($33,582).\n- Brazil has a moderate average night light intensity (0.63) and a moderate GDP per capita ($3,760).\n- Madagascar has the lowest average night light intensity (0.02) and the lowest GDP per capita ($249).\n\n**Conclusion**: There is a strong positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed. Higher night light intensity is associated with higher GDP per capita.",
