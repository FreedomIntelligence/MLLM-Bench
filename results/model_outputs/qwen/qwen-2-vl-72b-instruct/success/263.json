This scenario could have resulted from the vehicle driving over a large puddle of water that has partially frozen or is in the process of melting. The force of the vehicle's movement causes the water to splash dramatically, creating the visual effect seen in the image. This type of scene is common in areas experiencing melting snow or ice during the transition from winter to spring.",
