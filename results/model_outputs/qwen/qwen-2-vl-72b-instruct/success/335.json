The outsole appears to be peeling off, which can affect the shoe's grip and stability. Wearing this shoe could potentially be a safety hazard as it might:\n\n1. **Increase the Risk of Slipping**: The peeling sole can reduce traction, making it easier to slip and fall.\n2. **Lack Support**: The compromised sole might not provide adequate support, leading to potential foot injuries.\n3. **Cause Uneven Wear**: The uneven surface of the sole could cause the shoe to wear unevenly, further compromising its integrity.\n\nIt is advisable to replace the shoe to ensure safety and prevent any potential injuries.",
