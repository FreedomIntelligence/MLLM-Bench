    "answer": "The illustration depicts four big cats, each with distinct species-specific features:\n\n1. **Tiger (top left)**:\n   - **Fur Pattern**: The tiger has a distinctive striped pattern, with a combination of orange and black stripes.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a robust body with a relatively short tail.\n   - **Mouth**: The tiger's mouth is open, showing its teeth, which is characteristic of its predatory nature.\n\n2. **Puma (top right)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The puma has a uniform tawny color, without any stripes or spots.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a sleek, muscular body with a long tail.\n   - **Mouth**: The puma's mouth is slightly open, showing its teeth.\n\n3. **Lion (bottom left)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The lion has a tawny fur color, similar to the puma, but with a more robust and heavier body.\n   - **Mane**: The most distinctive feature is the lion's mane, which is thick and dark, framing its face.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a powerful and muscular body.\n\n4. **Lioness with Cubs (bottom right)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The lioness has a similar tawny color to the lion, but without the mane.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a more slender body compared to the lion.\n   - **Cubs**: The lioness is depicted with two cubs, which have a similar fur color but are smaller in size.\n\nEach species is characterized by its unique fur pattern, body shape, and other physical features that help distinguish them from one another.",
