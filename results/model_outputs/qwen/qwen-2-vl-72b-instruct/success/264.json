    "answer": "Structural damage within a building can be caused by various factors, and signs of significant stress on interior walls, such as cracks or bulging, can indicate underlying issues. Here are some possible reasons for such damage:\n\n1. **Foundation Problems**: Issues with the foundation, such as settling, heaving, or erosion, can cause walls to crack or bulge. This is often due to poor soil conditions, changes in moisture levels, or inadequate construction practices.\n\n2. **Seismic Activity**: Earthquakes or other seismic events can cause significant stress on a building's structure, leading to cracks and other forms of damage.\n\n3. **Environmental Factors**: Extreme weather conditions, such as heavy rain, flooding, or temperature fluctuations, can weaken the structural integrity of a building over time.\n\n4. **Construction Defects**: Poor construction practices, such as using substandard materials or inadequate support structures, can lead to structural failures.\n\n5. **Renovation or Expansion**: Modifications to the building, such as adding new floors or walls, can place additional stress on the existing structure, potentially causing damage.\n\n6. **Soil Movement**: Expansive soils that swell and shrink with changes in moisture levels can cause stress on the foundation and walls.\n\n7. **Water Damage**: Leaks or poor drainage can weaken the structural elements of a building, leading to cracks and other forms of damage.\n\n8. **Age of the Building**: Older buildings may show signs of wear and tear, which can manifest as cracks or bulging in walls.\n\nIt's important to have a professional structural engineer or building inspector assess the building to determine the exact cause of the damage and recommend appropriate repairs or reinforcements.",
