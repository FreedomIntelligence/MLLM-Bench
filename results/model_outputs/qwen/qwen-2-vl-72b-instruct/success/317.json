    "answer": "Let's analyze each of the given equations:\n\n1. \\( a^3 \\div a^5 = a^{3-5} = a^{-2} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\) (for \\( a \\neq 0 \\))\n   - This is correct. When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents.\n\n2. \\( (0.0001)^0 = (100000)^0 \\)\n   - This is correct. Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.\n\n3. \\( m^3 \\div m^3 = m^{3-3} = m^0 = 1 \\)\n   - This is correct. When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents, and any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.\n\n4. \\( 8x^{10} \\div 2x^2 = 6x^8 \\)\n   - This is incorrect. When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents, and you also divide the coefficients:\n     \\[\n     8x^{10} \\div 2x^2 = 4x^{10-2} = 4x^8\n     \\]\n\n5. \\( (x^n)^2 \\div x^n = x^2 \\)\n   - This is incorrect. When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents, and when raising a power to a power, you multiply the exponents:\n     \\[\n     (x^n)^2 \\div x^n = x^{2n} \\div x^n = x^{2n-n} = x^n\n     \\]\n\nSo, out of the five equations, three are correct: equations 1, 2, and 3.",
