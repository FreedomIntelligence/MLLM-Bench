It was a gift from France to the United States in 1886, commemorating the centennial of American independence.\n   - The statue was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel, the same engineer who designed the Eiffel Tower.\n\n2. **Welcoming Immigrants**:\n   - The statue has become an iconic symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving in the United States. The famous poem by Emma Lazarus, \"The New Colossus,\" inscribed on a plaque at the base of the statue, invites immigrants to \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n   - This has made the Statue of Liberty a powerful symbol of hope and opportunity for generations of immigrants seeking a better life in America.\n\n3. **Cultural and Artistic Significance**:\n   - The statue is a masterpiece of 19th-century sculpture and engineering. Its design and construction represent a significant achievement in both art and technology.\n   - It has been featured in countless works of art, literature, and media, further cementing its place in American culture.\n\n4. **International Friendship and Diplomacy**:\n   - The gift of the Statue of Liberty from France to the United States symbolized the enduring friendship between the two nations, which had been allies during the American Revolution.\n   - It also served as a diplomatic gesture, strengthening ties between the two countries.\n\n5. **Tourism and National Pride**:\n   - The Statue of Liberty is one of the most visited landmarks in the United States, attracting millions of tourists each year.\n   - It is a source of national pride and is often used in marketing and promotional materials to represent the country.\n\nIn summary, the Statue of Liberty is not just a physical monument but a powerful symbol of freedom, democracy, and the American spirit of welcoming immigrants. It stands as a testament to international friendship, cultural achievement, and national pride.",
