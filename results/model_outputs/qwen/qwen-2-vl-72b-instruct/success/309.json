    "answer": "If the container in the top left corner of the picture, which appears to be a tumbler with a lid, is filled with boiling water at 100째C, there is a risk that people might be scalded if they hold the bottle without any precautions. Boiling water can cause severe burns upon contact with skin. However, the risk can be mitigated by:\n\n1. **Using a Heat-Resistant Sleeve or Holder:** Many tumblers come with heat-resistant sleeves or holders that can be used to protect hands from the heat.\n2. **Waiting for the Water to Cool:** Allowing the water to cool down to a safer temperature before handling the tumbler can significantly reduce the risk of burns.\n3. **Using Insulated Tumblers:** Some tumblers are specifically designed with insulation to keep hot liquids hot and protect the hands from the heat.\n\nIf these precautions are taken, the risk of scalding can be minimized.",
