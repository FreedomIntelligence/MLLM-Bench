Here are some pieces of advice:\n\n1. **Monitor Your Temperature**: Keep an eye on your temperature over the next few hours. If it continues to rise or if you develop other symptoms like chills, cough, or difficulty breathing, seek medical advice.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\n\n3. **Rest**: Get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\n\n4. **Medication**: If you are uncomfortable, over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may help reduce fever and alleviate symptoms.\n\n5. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: If the fever persists for more than a few days, or if you have underlying health conditions, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember, these are general guidelines. Always follow the advice of a healthcare professional for specific medical conditions.",
