    "answer": "To determine the area of the circle, we first need to find the diameter of the circle. The diameter is the longest distance across the circle, passing through the center.\n\nFrom the given figure, we can see three squares inside the circle:\n\n1. The largest square has a side length of 6 units.\n2. The medium square has a side length of 4 units.\n3. The smallest square has a side length of 2 units.\n\nThe diameter of the circle is the sum of the side lengths of the largest and medium squares:\n\n\\[ \\text{Diameter} = 6 + 4 = 10 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nNow that we have the diameter, we can find the radius, which is half of the diameter:\n\n\\[ \\text{Radius} = \\frac{\\text{Diameter}}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times (\\text{Radius})^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the radius we found:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times (5)^2 = \\pi \\times 25 = 25\\pi \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\pi} \\]\n\nThis means the area of the circle is 25 times the value of π (approximately 3.14159).",
