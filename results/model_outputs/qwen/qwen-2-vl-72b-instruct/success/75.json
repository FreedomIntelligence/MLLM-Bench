The person standing at the front appears to be giving a presentation or lecture, using a whiteboard and a digital screen displaying mathematical equations. The students are seated and seem to be engaged in the session.\n\nGiven the presence of mathematical equations on the screens and the whiteboard, it is likely that the educational activity is related to a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subject, possibly mathematics or physics.
