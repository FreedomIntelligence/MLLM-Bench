    "answer": "The topic of the speech is the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students. The speaker argues that these exams are necessary for three reasons: they ensure fairness, they help students grow, and they provide a uniform evaluation.\n\nThe rhetorical codes used in the speech include:\n\n1. **Hypophora**: The speaker asks a rhetorical question (\"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college?\") to engage the audience and highlight the importance of the exams.\n\n2. **Anaphora**: The repetition of \"they have\" (money, parents with higher social status, better connections) emphasizes the advantages that some students have without the exams, making the case for fairness.\n\n3. **Antithesis**: The contrast between \"Your family or money doesn't help here\" and \"it's all about how much you study and what you can do\" highlights the fairness of the exams.\n\n4. **Pathos**: The speaker appeals to emotions by mentioning stories of students from poor families who studied hard to get into top universities, emphasizing the exams' role in changing lives.\n\n5. **Ethos**: The use of Einstein's quote about learning (\"learning is more than remembering facts – it's about how to use your mind\") adds credibility to the argument that the exams help students grow.\n\n6. **Metaphor**: The statement \"They’re not just tests, but keys to the future\" uses a metaphor to convey the importance of the exams in opening doors to future opportunities.\n\nThese rhetorical codes are used to effectively persuade the audience of the necessity and benefits of college entrance exams.",
