    "answer": "To solve the question marks in the image, we need to determine the values of the shapes (circle, triangle, star, and square) based on the given equations. Let's solve step by step:\n\n1. From the equations on the left side:\n   - Circle + Triangle = 8\n   - Circle - Triangle = 4\n\n   Adding these two equations:\n   \\[\n   (Circle + Triangle) + (Circle - Triangle) = 8 + 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\times Circle = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Circle = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Now, substitute the value of Circle into one of the equations:\n   \\[\n   6 + Triangle = 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Triangle = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we use the values of Circle and Triangle to solve for the other shapes:\n   - Star + Square = 12\n   - Star - Square = 8\n\n   Adding these two equations:\n   \\[\n   (Star + Square) + (Star - Square) = 12 + 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\times Star = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Star = 10\n   \\]\n\n   Now, substitute the value of Star into one of the equations:\n   \\[\n   10 + Square = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Square = 2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the values of the shapes are:\n- Circle = 6\n- Triangle = 2\n- Star = 10\n- Square = 2\n\nNow, we can fill in the question marks on the right side of the image:\n- Star = 10\n- Circle = 6\n- Square = 2\n- Triangle = 2\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n- Star = 10\n- Circle = 6\n- Square = 2\n- Triangle = 2",
