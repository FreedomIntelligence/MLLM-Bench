The dog's left ear (on our right as we look at the image) has a notch in the left image but is whole in the right image.\n3. The flower to the left of the dog has an extra petal in the left image compared to the right image.\n4. The doghouse in the left image has a dark brown patch on its roof, which is not present in the right image.\n5. The water bowl in the left image is empty, while in the right image it is full with a bone in it.\n6. There is a snail in the bottom right corner of the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n7. The top of the fence directly above the dog's head has an extra plank on the right side of the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n8. The bush behind the doghouse on the left side of the image has one less leaf in the left image compared to the right image.\n9. On the path in front of the dog, there is one stone on the left image and two stones on the right image.\n10. The window on the doghouse is a different shape: it's round in the left image and square in the right image.\n\nThese are the ten differences between the two images.",
