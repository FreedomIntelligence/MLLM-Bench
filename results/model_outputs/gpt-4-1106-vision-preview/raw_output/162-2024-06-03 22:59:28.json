This word choice is likely to provoke a strong emotional response from the reader, creating a sense of moral outrage and emphasizing the heinous nature of the crime.\n\nThe larger headline reads, \"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL,\" employing a collective language that implies an attack on one individual is an attack on a larger group. This kind of language can create a sense of unity or solidarity among readers who identify with the group being referenced. It also adds a dramatic flair to the political context being discussed, suggesting that the consequences of the actions mentioned would be widely felt.\n\nThe potential impact of such emotive language on readers includes heightened emotional engagement with the stories, a sense of urgency or importance about the issues being discussed, and a stronger alignment with the sentiments being expressed by the publication. It can also lead to increased readership as the provocative nature of the headlines may compel people to learn more about the stories.",
