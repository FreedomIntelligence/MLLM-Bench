                "content": "This image appears to be a public health notice or advisory related to the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, specifically mentioning Wuhan City in Hubei Province, China. The notice provides guidance on what to do if someone has symptoms such as cough or fever, advising them to wear a disposable face mask and contact a hospital before visiting it. It also requests that if someone has stayed in Wuhan City, they should inform the hospital staff of their detailed activities.\n\nThe notice includes a map highlighting the location of Hubei Province in China and an illustration demonstrating the appropriate response (wearing a mask and making a phone call) before going to a hospital. Additionally, the notice provides information about medical facilities with multilingual support and references the Japan National Tourism Association (JNTO) with a link to their emergency guide and a contact number for a multilingual call center.\n\nThe date at the bottom indicates that this notice was issued on January 27, 2020, which aligns with the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when the virus was primarily concentrated in Wuhan before it spread globally. The text is provided in both English and Japanese, suggesting that the notice was likely intended for a multilingual audience, potentially in a setting where international travelers or residents in Japan might see it.",
