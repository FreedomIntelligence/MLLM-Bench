                "content": "To prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR, we can use the concept of congruent triangles. Two triangles are congruent if they have the same size and shape, which can be shown using various criteria such as side-side-side (SSS), side-angle-side (SAS), angle-side-angle (ASA), angle-angle-side (AAS), and right angle-hypotenuse-side (RHS) for right-angled triangles.\n\nFrom the given information, we know the following:\n\n1. Triangles PQR and PUS are both equilateral, which means all their sides are equal in length and all their angles are equal in measure (each angle measures 60 degrees).\n\n2. Since triangles PQR and PUS share the side PQ, it is congruent to itself by the reflexive property.\n\n3. Triangle PQR and triangle PUS have two sides that are equal to each other since they are both equilateral. Therefore, PR = PS and QR = US.\n\n4. The angle PQR is equal to the angle PUS since both are angles in equilateral triangles, and therefore, each measures 60 degrees.\n\nWith these points in mind, we can use the SAS (side-angle-side) congruence criterion to prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR:\n\n- Side PQ is common to both triangles PUQ and PSR.\n- The angle PQR is equal to the angle PUS (both are 60 degrees).\n- Side PR is equal to side PS because triangles PQR and PUS are equilateral.\n\nTherefore, by the SAS criterion, we can conclude that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.",
