The larger rectangle has dimensions 6 by 4, and the smaller one has dimensions 2 by 2. These rectangles form a larger square with the side equal to 6 (the sum of 4 from the larger rectangle and 2 from the smaller one), which appears to be the diameter of the circle since the corners of the square touch the circle.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the circle is 6 units, and the radius \\( r \\) is half of the diameter, which is 3 units.\n\nNow we can calculate the area:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times 3^2 = \\pi \\times 9 \\]\n\nTo get a numerical answer, we need to use the approximation of \\( \\pi \\). Using the common approximation \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n\n\\[ A \\approx 3.14159 \\times 9 \\]\n\\[ A \\approx 28.27431 \\]\n\nSo, the approximate area of the circle is 28.27431 square units.",
