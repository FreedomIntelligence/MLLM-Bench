This is likely due to a sandstorm or dust storm, which are common weather occurrences in arid and semi-arid regions. Such storms are caused by strong winds lifting large amounts of sand and dust from dry soils into the atmosphere, creating an opaque haze that can reduce visibility and air quality.\n\nSand and dust storms can be triggered by a variety of factors, including intense low-pressure systems, strong winds associated with thunderstorms, or the passage of weather fronts. These storms can have a significant impact on the environment and human health, as they can cause respiratory problems, reduce soil fertility by blowing away topsoil, and disrupt transportation.\n\nThe use of veils or other face coverings is a practical response to such conditions, helping to filter out the sand and dust particles and reduce the inhalation of these potentially harmful materials. This practice is especially important in regions where such weather events are a frequent occurrence.",
