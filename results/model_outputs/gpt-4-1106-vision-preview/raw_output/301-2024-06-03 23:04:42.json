                "content": "To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the value of each fruit based on the given equations and then select the correct puzzle piece to complete the second row and first column.\n\nFrom the first row, we can see that two apples equal 2, so one apple equals 1.\n\nFrom the second row, one apple (which we've determined is 1) plus an unknown number of bananas equals 4. Since one apple is 1, the bananas must total 3. Since there are three bananas shown, each banana must be worth 1.\n\nFrom the third row, one apple (1) plus three bananas (each worth 1, so 3 in total) equals 7. However, we've already accounted for 4 (1 apple + 3 bananas), which means the remaining piece, which is the strawberry, must be worth 3.\n\nNow that we know the values of each fruit, we can calculate the arithmetic expression given at the top:\n\n(1 apple + 3 bananas) x 2 strawberries = (1 + 3) x 2 x 3 = 4 x 2 x 3 = 8 x 3 = 24.\n\nTo complete the puzzle, we need to find the piece that fits into the second row and first column. The correct piece would be the one with the strawberry since the equation in the second row is missing the strawberry piece to complete the arithmetic expression of 1 apple + 3 bananas + 2 strawberries = 7. The strawberry has a value of 3, which when added to the 4 (1 apple + 3 bananas) gives us the total of 7.\n\nTherefore, the piece with the strawberry should be placed in the second row and first column to complete the puzzle.",
