                "content": "Problem 11 states that triangles PQR and PUS are both equilateral and asks to prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR. \n\nTo prove this, we can use the properties of equilateral triangles and the concept of congruence:\n\n1. Since PQR is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so PQ = PR = QR.\n2. Since PUS is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so PU = PS = US.\n3. In equilateral triangles, all angles are also equal. Therefore, all angles in PQR and PUS are 60 degrees.\n4. Triangle PUQ shares the side PU with triangle PUS, and since PUS is equilateral, we know that PU = US.\n5. Triangle PSR shares the side PS with triangle PUS, and since PUS is equilateral, we know that PS = US.\n6. Since PQ = PR (from the equilateral triangle PQR), and PU = PS (from the equilateral triangle PUS), by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence postulate, we can say that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.\n\nWe have shown that all three corresponding sides of triangle PUQ and triangle PSR are equal, which is enough to prove that the triangles are congruent by the SSS postulate.",
