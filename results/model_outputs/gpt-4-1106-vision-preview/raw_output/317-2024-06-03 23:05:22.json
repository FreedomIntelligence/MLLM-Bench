                "content": "Let's analyze each equation one by one:\n\n1) \\( a^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\cdot a^5 = a^{3-5} = a^{-2} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq 0 \\))\nThis equation is incorrect. The mistake is in the exponent during the multiplication step. The correct operation when multiplying powers with the same base is to add the exponents, not subtract. The correct equation should be: \\( a^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\cdot a^5 = a^{\\frac{3}{2} + 5} = a^{\\frac{13}{2}} \\).\n\n2) \\( (0.0001)^0 = (10000)^0 \\)\nThis equation is correct. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so both sides equal 1.\n\n3) \\( m^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\cdot m^3 = m^{3-\\frac{3}{2}} = m^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1 \\)\nThis equation is incorrect. The mistake is in the exponent during the multiplication step and the final evaluation. The correct operation when multiplying powers with the same base is to add the exponents. The correct equation should be: \\( m^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\cdot m^3 = m^{\\frac{3}{2} + 3} = m^{\\frac{9}{2}} \\). Additionally, \\( m^{\\frac{9}{2}} \\) does not equal 1 unless \\( m \\) is 1.\n\n4) \\( 8z^{10} \\div 2z^2 = 6z^8 \\)\nThis equation is incorrect. When dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents. However, the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) are divided normally. The correct equation should be: \\( 8z^{10} \\div 2z^2 = 4z^{10-2} = 4z^8 \\), not \\( 6z^8 \\).\n\n5) \\( (z^n)^2 \\div z^n = z^2 \\)\nThis equation is incorrect. When raising a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. Then, when dividing powers with the same base, you subtract the exponents. The correct equation should be: \\( (z^n)^2 \\div z^n = z^{2n} \\div z^n = z^{2n-n} = z^n \\), not \\( z^2 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, out of the five equations, only the second one is correct.",
