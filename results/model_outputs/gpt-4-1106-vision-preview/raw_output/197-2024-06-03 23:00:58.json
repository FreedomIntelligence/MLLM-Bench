Blisters are small pockets of body fluid that can form due to friction, burns, or other types of skin damage. General care for a blister may include keeping it clean to prevent infection and protecting it with a sterile bandage. If the blister is painful or shows signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, pus, or increased pain, it's important to consult a healthcare professional.",
