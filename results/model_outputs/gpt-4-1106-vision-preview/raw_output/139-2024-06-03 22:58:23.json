This method is characteristic of traditional fishing practices seen on Inle Lake, Myanmar. The primary tool is the conical net, which is used to trap fish in shallow waters. Based on the aquatic environment and the unique equipment depicted, the individual's profession is likely that of a traditional fisherman practicing a distinctive style of fishing associated with this region. The leg-rowing technique allows the fisherman to keep both hands free to handle the net while maneuvering the boat.",
