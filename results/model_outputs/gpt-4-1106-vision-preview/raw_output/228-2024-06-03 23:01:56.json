Hermit crabs are known for their behavior of living in secondhand shells, which they find and occupy to protect their soft abdomens. They do not grow their own shells but instead use the discarded shells of other marine organisms, typically gastropods (snails). This relationship is an example of commensalism, where the hermit crab benefits from the shell as a protective home, while the original creator of the shell is not harmed since it has already abandoned or died and left the shell.",
