The train is moving quickly, and the camera's shutter speed is slow enough that it captures the movement as a blur. This technique is often used to convey a sense of speed and motion in photography. The stationary elements, such as the platform signs, appear sharp, indicating that the camera was held still while the moving train blurred during the shot.",
