                "content": "The image displays a bar chart titled \"Number of Meets in the Last 12 Months\" with the x-axis representing months from November 2022 to October 2023 and the y-axis representing the number of meets, with a scale that seems to increase by increments of 247.5, starting at 0 and going up to 1485.\n\nTo find the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023, we would need to estimate the values for each month based on the bar heights and then calculate the average.\n\nHere are the approximate values for each month by visual estimation:\n\n- April 2023: Around 900 meets\n- May 2023: Slightly over 1237.5 meets, let's estimate around 1260 meets\n- June 2023: Around 990 meets\n- July 2023: Around 750 meets\n\nNow, to calculate the average:\n\n(900 + 1260 + 990 + 750) / 4 = 3900 / 4 = 975\n\nSo, the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023 is around 975 meets. Please note that this is an estimation based on the visual representation in the chart and the actual numbers could be slightly different.",
