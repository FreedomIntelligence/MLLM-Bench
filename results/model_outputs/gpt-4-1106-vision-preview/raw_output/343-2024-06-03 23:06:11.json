Laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States require businesses and public spaces to accommodate service animals, even in places where pets are typically not allowed.\n\nIf a visually impaired person with a service dog is denied entry to a place because of their service animal, despite the presence of such a sign, it could indeed be considered discriminatory treatment, depending on the local laws and regulations regarding service animals. It is generally expected that establishments make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, which includes allowing service animals to accompany their handlers.",
