                "content": "The speech is about the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students. The speaker argues that these exams are essential because they provide a fair and equal starting point for all students regardless of their family background or financial situation, help students to grow and learn problem-solving skills, and offer a uniform platform for evaluating students' knowledge and skills.\n\nThe speaker uses several rhetorical devices to strengthen the argument:\n\n1. Hypophora: This is when the speaker poses a question and then immediately answers it. In the speech, the question \"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college?\" is followed by a discussion on the potential unfairness of admission based on family conditions and social status.\n\n2. Anaphora: This is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. The phrase \"for students with a better family background, they have money, they have parents\u2019 with higher social status, they have better connections (Anaphora)\" repeats \"they have\" to emphasize the advantages some students might have over others.\n\n3. Antithesis: The use of contrasting ideas in close proximity. \"Your family or money doesn't help here \u2013 it's all about how much you study and what you can do (Antithesis)\" contrasts external factors with personal effort and ability.\n\n4. Pathos: This appeals to the audience's emotions. The speaker uses the story of children from poor families studying hard and changing their fate to evoke feelings of hope and fairness.\n\n5. Ethos: This establishes the credibility of the speaker. By quoting Einstein and discussing the broader benefits of exam preparation, the speaker builds trust and authority on the subject.\n\n6. Metaphor: This is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn\u2019t literally true but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. \"They\u2019re not just tests, but keys to the future (Metaphor)\" compares entrance exams to keys, suggesting they unlock future opportunities.\n\nThe speech concludes with a motivational statement encouraging students to work hard and pursue their dreams, reinforcing the initial argument for the importance of college entrance exams.",
