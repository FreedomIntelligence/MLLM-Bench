These types of containers are usually double-walled with insulation to keep beverages hot or cold while protecting the user's hands from extreme temperatures.\n\nIf the container is filled with boiling water at 100\u00b0C, it is designed in such a way that the outside surface should not become too hot to handle. However, the actual temperature that the outside of the container reaches can depend on the quality of the insulation and the specific design of the mug. It is always advisable to handle hot containers with care to prevent any risk of scalding.",
