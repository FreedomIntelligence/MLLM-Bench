This type of fishing involves training cormorant birds to catch fish and bring them back to the fisherman. The attire, the presence of the birds, and the setting on a narrow boat are indicative of this ancient practice, which is known to have been used in various parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The man is likely wearing traditional clothing associated with his occupation, and the pole he is carrying is used to give the cormorants a place to perch when they are not fishing.",
