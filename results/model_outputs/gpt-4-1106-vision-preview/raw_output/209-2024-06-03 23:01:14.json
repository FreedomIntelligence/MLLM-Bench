If this is indeed a moment after a shot was made, the basketball would typically fall through the hoop in the next second, assuming that it is not stuck. However, if the ball is wedged tightly, it may require external interference to dislodge it. Normally, in a game situation, players might jump to tap the ball out or use another object to knock it loose if it doesn't fall through on its own due to gravity.",
