The chasing arrows triangle: This is the universal recycling symbol, which indicates that the material is recyclable. The three arrows represent the three steps of recycling: collection, remanufacturing or processing, and purchasing recycled products.\n\n2. The number \"2\" inside the triangle: This number identifies the type of plastic resin used to make the item. The number 2 is used to designate high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is a commonly recycled plastic used in bottles for milk, water, juice, detergent, and household cleaners.\n\n3. The acronym \"HDPE\" below the triangle: This stands for high-density polyethylene, confirming the type of plastic resin used for the item.\n\nTogether, these elements inform consumers and waste management facilities that the item is made of HDPE and is recyclable.",
