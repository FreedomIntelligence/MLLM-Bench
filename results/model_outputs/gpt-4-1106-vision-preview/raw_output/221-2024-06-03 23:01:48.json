                "content": "In the image, you can see a shark with several smaller, striped fish swimming in close proximity to it. These small fish are commonly known as pilot fish. The relationship between the shark and the pilot fish is a classic example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.\n\nIn this type of interaction, both the shark and the pilot fish benefit from each other's presence. The pilot fish feed on parasites and leftover food scraps from the shark, which keeps the shark clean and healthy. In return, the pilot fish gain protection from predators by swimming close to the shark, a much larger and more intimidating creature. The shark does not attack the pilot fish because they provide a service and are not seen as prey.\n\nThis mutualistic relationship allows the pilot fish to safely forage for food while the shark stays clean and healthy, creating a beneficial dynamic for both species.",
