                "content": "The landmark in the image is the Statue of Liberty, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, USA. This colossal neoclassical sculpture was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was a gift from the people of France to the United States and was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty holds historical and social significance as a symbol of freedom and democracy. It has served as a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad, especially those who came through Ellis Island, and is often associated with the pursuit of the American Dream. The statue represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, and she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet, symbolizing the end of oppression and the triumph of liberty.\n\nOver time, the Statue of Liberty has become an iconic emblem of the United States and a representation of its values, inspiring countless people around the world. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 for its cultural significance.",
