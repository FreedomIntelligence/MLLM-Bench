                "content": "To find the equation of the circle shown in the image, we need to know the center and the radius of the circle. The general form of the equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is:\n\n\\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nThe image provides two points on the circumference: (1, -2) and (3, 2). We can infer that the diameter of the circle passes through these two points, since they are connected by a dashed line, which typically represents the diameter in such diagrams. The midpoint of the line segment joining these two points will give us the center of the circle (h, k).\n\nLet's calculate the midpoint, which is the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{(1 + 3)}{2} = 2 \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{(-2 + 2)}{2} = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the center of the circle is (2, 0).\n\nNext, we need to find the radius of the circle. The radius is half the length of the diameter. We can calculate the length of the diameter using the distance formula between the two points:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (2 - (-2))^2} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (4)^2} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{4 + 16} \\]\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{20} \\]\n\\[ d = 2\\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nSince the diameter is \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\), the radius (r) is half of that, which is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nFinally, we can plug the center coordinates (h, k) and the radius r into the general equation of a circle:\n\n\\[ (x - 2)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 \\]\n\\[ (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 5 \\]\n\nThis is the equation of the circle with center (2, 0) and radius \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).",
