The water bowl in the left image is empty, but it is filled with water in the right image.\n3. The flower to the left of the dog has an extra petal in the right image.\n4. The dog's ear in the right image has a notch missing compared to the left image.\n5. The window on the doghouse is a different shape; it is round in the left image and square in the right image.\n6. The fence in the background has one less plank on the right side in the right image.\n7. The path has an extra stone on the right side in the right image.\n8. The tail of the dog is up in the left image, but down in the right image.\n9. The bush to the right of the doghouse is missing a leaf on the top in the right image.\n10. There's a butterfly above the dog in the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n\nThese are the ten differences between the two images.",
