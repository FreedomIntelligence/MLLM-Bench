The fishing line: In the left image, the fishing line is attached to the fishing rod, while in the right image, the line is not attached to the rod.\n2. The penguin's beak: The penguin on the left has a small white spot on its beak, but the spot is missing on the penguin's beak in the right image.\n3. The penguin's feet: The left penguin has three visible toes on its right foot, but the right penguin only has two visible toes on its right foot.\n4. The ice formation: In the background, there is a small ice formation on the left side of the left image that is missing from the right image.\n5. The fishing lure/bobber: The fishing lure or bobber on the left image is red, whereas on the right image it is blue.\n\nThese are the five differences between the two images.",
