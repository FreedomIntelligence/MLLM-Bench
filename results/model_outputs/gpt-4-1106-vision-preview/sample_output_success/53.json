The architectural style of the Sydney Opera House is often considered an expression of modernism, or more specifically, late modernism or structural expressionism. It is known for its unique use of a series of gleaming white sail-like shells as its roof structure, which has become an iconic symbol of both Sydney and Australia.\n\nThe design concept was created by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won an international design competition in 1957 that led to the building's construction. Utzon's design was revolutionary at the time and posed significant engineering challenges. The concept of the shells was inspired by multiple influences, including the sails of yachts, which is fitting given the building's location on the waterfront at Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe image, however, has been digitally altered to include what appears to be watermelon patterns on the sails of the Opera House. This is not part of the original design and is likely an artistic or whimsical modification made for visual effect or a particular event or campaign. The Sydney Opera House, with its original design, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.",
