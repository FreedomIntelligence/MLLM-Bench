The smaller fish are not being attacked by the shark and seem to be swimming alongside it harmoniously.\n\nThis kind of interaction is often an example of a symbiotic relationship known as commensalism, where one species benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed. In this case, the smaller fish, often called pilot fish, benefit by feeding on parasites and leftover scraps of the shark's meals, keeping the shark clean and getting a free meal in the process. The shark is not affected negatively by the presence of these fish, and it does not expend energy to chase or eat them, as they are not its preferred prey and the energy gained from consuming them would not be worth the effort.\n\nThe pilot fish also gain protection from predators by swimming close to the shark; predators are less likely to approach a shark to get to the smaller fish. The bold stripes on the pilot fish may serve as a signal to other animals that they are not good prey, either because they are unpalatable or because they are under the protection of the shark.\n\nThe relationship between the shark and the pilot fish is a fascinating example of how different species can interact in the marine ecosystem in a way that benefits at least one of the parties involved without causing harm to the other.",
