Each leaf has a bright yellow margin that frames a green center, creating a striking contrast. The variegation pattern is quite consistent across the leaves, suggesting that it's a characteristic feature of this particular hosta variety. The plant is relatively low to the ground and has a lush, full appearance, with leaves that emerge from the center and spread outwards.\n\nThe hosta is planted in a bed of dark brown mulch, which further accentuates the bright colors of the leaves. Around the hosta, you can see other green plants, which appear to be different varieties, possibly other hosta plants without variegation or different shade-loving perennials. The overall impression is of a well-maintained garden bed designed for visual interest and contrast.",
