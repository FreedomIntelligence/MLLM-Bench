The damage is concentrated mostly on the lower right corner, where the glass is heavily shattered and parts of the internal components may be exposed due to missing pieces of glass. There are also cracks extending from the damaged area across the back of the phone.\n\nDespite the damage to the back, the phone might still be usable if the front screen and internal components are not affected. However, there are several concerns that should be addressed:\n\n1. Safety: Handling a phone with broken glass can lead to cuts or injury. If the glass continues to crack or break, it could pose a risk during use.\n\n2. Functionality: If the damage has compromised the phone's structure or internal components, it could affect the phone's functionality. This includes potential issues with wireless charging, if the phone supports it, due to the damage on the back.\n\n3. Water and dust resistance: If the phone was originally designed to be water and dust resistant, such resistance is likely compromised due to the damage. This means that the phone is now more vulnerable to elements that could further damage internal components.\n\n4. Resale value and aesthetics: The damage significantly affects the phone's aesthetic and reduces its resale value.\n\nTo ensure safety and maintain functionality, it is advisable to have the phone professionally assessed for repair. A technician can determine if there is any further unseen damage and replace the back glass to restore the phone's structural integrity and aesthetics. Repairing the back glass can also help in maintaining the phone's water and dust resistance features, if applicable.",
