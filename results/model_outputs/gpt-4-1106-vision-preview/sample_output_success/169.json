Here are the steps as detailed in the image:\n\n1. Place the book with its back on a table.\n2. Let the front cover down.\n3. Then let the back cover down.\n4. Open a few pages (referred to as \"leaves\") in the front.\n5. Then open a few pages at the back, alternating between the front and back.\n6. Gently press the pages down towards the center of the book.\n7. Repeat this process two or three times to limber up the binding.\n\nThe guide also includes a cautionary note:\n- Never force the back; if it does not readily yield, it is too tightly or strongly lined. The book requires gentle treatment, much like a machine needs lubricating.\n\nThe clarity and effectiveness of the instructions:\n- The instructions are clear and accompanied by simple illustrations that visually represent each step, which can be very helpful for visual learners.\n- The steps are presented in a logical order, starting from the initial placement of the book to the gentle handling of the pages.\n- The cautionary note is an important addition, as it emphasizes the need for care to prevent damage to the book.\n- The use of the term \"leaves\" for pages may be slightly confusing for some readers who are not familiar with this terminology, but it is a minor issue given the context and illustrations.\n- Overall, the guide seems effective in instructing readers on how to open a new book without causing damage to the spine or binding.",
