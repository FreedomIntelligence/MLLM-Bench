The notice provides guidance on what to do if someone has symptoms such as cough or fever, advising them to wear a disposable face mask and contact a hospital before visiting it. It also requests that if someone has stayed in Wuhan City, they should inform the hospital staff of their detailed activities.\n\nThe notice includes a map highlighting the location of Hubei Province in China and an illustration demonstrating the appropriate response (wearing a mask and making a phone call) before going to a hospital. Additionally, the notice provides information about medical facilities with multilingual support and references the Japan National Tourism Association (JNTO) with a link to their emergency guide and a contact number for a multilingual call center.\n\nThe date at the bottom indicates that this notice was issued on January 27, 2020, which aligns with the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when the virus was primarily concentrated in Wuhan before it spread globally. The text is provided in both English and Japanese, suggesting that the notice was likely intended for a multilingual audience, potentially in a setting where international travelers or residents in Japan might see it.",
