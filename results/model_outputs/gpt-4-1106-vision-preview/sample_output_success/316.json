Since we have no direct equation for \\( z \\), let's consider the fact that \\( z \\) must also satisfy the same conditions as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), since the equations are symmetric. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\( z = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\)\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. \\( x = 1 - \\frac{z}{z-1} \\)\n2. \\( y = 1 - \\frac{1}{z} \\)\n3. \\( z = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\)\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or by recognizing a pattern. Notice that the structure of the equations suggests that \\( x = y = z \\). Let's test this by substituting \\( x \\) for \\( z \\) in the third equation:\n\n\\( x = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x \\) to clear the fraction:\n\n\\( x^2 = x - 1 \\)\n\nMove all terms to one side:\n\n\\( x^2 - x + 1 = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, but it does not have real solutions because the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is negative:\n\n\\( (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 \\)\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for \\( x \\), which means there are no real solutions for \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) either. Thus, there is no real number solution for the product \\( xyz \\) based on the given equations.\n\nHowever, if there's a mistake in the problem or if we are looking for complex solutions, we would need to solve the quadratic equation using complex numbers. But as the problem stands, it seems there might be an error since these types of problems typically have real number solutions, especially in the context of an Olympiad problem.",
