The irony is evident in the juxtaposition of a person who expresses a dislike for dogs while a dog, depicted with a human-like expression and a caption suggesting approval (\"This is the way!\"), is seated in the car as a human passenger would be. The dog's approval implies a humorous endorsement of the driver's implied decision to eject the dog-disliking passenger, which is ironic because one would not typically expect a dog to make such decisions or to be pleased about human conflict.\n\nThe anthropomorphism of the dog, giving it human characteristics and emotions, adds to the humor by creating an absurd and whimsical scenario that is unexpected and playful. The dog's smug expression and the human-like pose contribute to the comedic effect.\n\nThe caption \"This is the way!\" is also a reference to a popular catchphrase from the television series \"The Mandalorian,\" which adds an element of memetic humor by incorporating a recognizable element from pop culture. This layer of humor appeals to those familiar with the source material and creates a shared in-joke among fans.",
