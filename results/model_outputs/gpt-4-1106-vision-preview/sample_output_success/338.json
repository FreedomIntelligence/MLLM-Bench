The ash and debris can lead to the contamination of water sources, destruction of habitats, and long-term soil fertility issues. Additionally, the air quality in such areas can be severely affected, posing respiratory health risks to humans and animals. Cleanup and recovery in such areas can be challenging and prolonged.",
