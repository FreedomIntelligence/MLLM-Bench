It shows data from various sources, including HadCRUT5, NOAAGlobalTemp, Kadokawa et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5, each represented by a different colored line. The time span covered by the data sets varies, with some starting as early as 1850 and others beginning later.\n\nThe key implication of the chart is the clear upward trend in global mean temperatures, particularly noticeable from around the 1970s onwards, which is consistent with the scientific consensus on global warming. The temperatures are shown in degrees Celsius (°C) above or below the baseline average of the late 19th century. The most recent years on the chart show that global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.2 to 1.4 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, indicating significant warming.\n\nThe presence of multiple data sets serves to confirm the robustness of the trend, as they all show a similar pattern of warming despite the different methodologies and periods of record. This chart is likely used to communicate the reality and severity of climate change to the public and policymakers.",
