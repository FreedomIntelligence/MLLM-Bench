However, the outcome will depend on his reach, hand-eye coordination, and the speed and trajectory of the ball.\n\nIf the goalkeeper successfully makes the save, the ball could be deflected out of play for a corner kick, pushed back into the field of play where outfield players will compete for the second ball, or caught securely, allowing him to retain possession. If the save is made but not caught, the positioning of the outfield players will be crucial. The defenders will need to be quick to react to clear the ball, while attackers will look to capitalize on any rebounds for a follow-up shot.\n\nThe surrounding players are positioned in anticipation of the next phase of play. The defenders (presumably in white) are preparing to mark the attackers or clear the ball if it comes back into play, while the attackers (presumably in red) are ready to pounce on any opportunities to score from a potential rebound.
