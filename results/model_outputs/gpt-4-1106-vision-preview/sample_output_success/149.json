The right image, labeled \"HOW IT FEELS,\" humorously exaggerates this task by replacing the baby with a highly sensitive explosive device, suggesting that the act of putting a baby to sleep can feel as tense and precarious as defusing a bomb. The visual metaphor exaggerates the challenge by implying that the slightest mistake could have dramatic consequences, much like a bomb detonating.\n\nThe humor arises from the hyperbolic comparison between a delicate, everyday parenting duty and the extreme, life-or-death situation of bomb disposal. It plays on the common parental experience of trying not to wake a sleeping baby, which can indeed feel like an operation requiring utmost precision and care, and magnifies it to an absurd level. This resonates with many parents who understand the stakes of the situation in an emotional, if not literal, sense, thus finding the exaggeration amusing.",
