The food items include what looks like skewered meat and sandwiches with different fillings.\n\nThe skewered meat has been cooked using a grilling method. Grilling involves cooking food on a grill over direct heat, which often imparts a charred flavor and can create a crispy exterior. The meat is typically marinated or seasoned before being placed on skewers and cooked on the grill.\n\nThe sandwiches contain fillings that could have been prepared using different cooking methods depending on their ingredients. Common cooking methods for sandwich fillings include grilling, frying, baking, or sautéing. The bread used for the sandwiches is typically baked, which involves cooking the dough in an oven until it has risen and turned golden brown.\n\nThe other food item that looks like it has a flaky crust could be some form of fried pastry or meat covered in batter. If it's a pastry, it could have been baked, while if it's a battered meat, it would have been deep-fried. Deep-frying involves submerging food in hot oil, which cooks the food quickly and gives it a crispy texture.\n\nOverall, the cooking methods visible in the image seem to include grilling, baking, and possibly deep-frying.",
