The image you have provided is not an ultrasound image of a fetus, which is typically used to measure crown-rump length (CRL) to estimate gestational age.

There is also a large, colored mass on the right side of the image, which appears to have been artificially colored to highlight it, possibly indicating a medical condition or abnormality.\n\nTo determine the gestational age of a fetus, an ultrasound image showing the profile of the fetus with a visible head and rump is required, and measurements are taken from the top of the head to the bottom of the rump (excluding the limbs and yolk sac).
