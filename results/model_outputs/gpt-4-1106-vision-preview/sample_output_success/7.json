Saxophones are commonly made of brass and are played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of a clarinet.\n\nThe saxophone is used in a wide variety of musical genres, including jazz, classical, rock, and pop. It is known for its rich, expressive tones and its ability to play both smooth, lyrical melodies and fast, complex passages.\n\nPlaying the saxophone involves techniques such as breath control, finger positioning, and embouchure adjustment (the way the player's mouth interacts with the mouthpiece and reed). Advanced techniques include vibrato (a slight fluctuation in pitch for expressiveness), altissimo (producing notes higher than the instrument's normal range), and multiphonics (producing more than one note at a time). Players can also manipulate the sound through various articulations, such as staccato (short, detached notes) and legato (smooth, connected notes).",
