The grip has unraveled and is fraying, exposing the underlying handle.\n\nHere are some suggestions to repair the grip of the racket:\n\n1. Remove the old grip: Carefully peel off the remaining grip and any adhesive residue from the handle. Make sure the surface is clean before applying a new grip.\n\n2. Choose a new grip: Purchase a replacement grip that suits your preference. There are different types of grips, such as overgrips, replacement grips, and towel grips, each offering different levels of cushioning, sweat absorption, and thickness.\n\n3. Wrap the new grip: Start wrapping the new grip from the base of the handle, ensuring that it's tight and even as you spiral it up towards the shaft. Overlap each wrap slightly to ensure full coverage and a secure fit. Some grips come with a finishing tape to secure the end in place.\n\n4. Secure the end: Once you've reached the top of the handle, cut off any excess grip and use the finishing tape (if provided) or a piece of adhesive tape to secure the end of the grip to the handle.\n\n5. Check the grip: Make sure that the grip is comfortable in your hand and that there are no loose ends or bumps. A well-applied grip should be smooth and even.\n\nIf you're not comfortable replacing the grip yourself, you can take the racket to a sports store or a professional who can re-grip it for you.",
