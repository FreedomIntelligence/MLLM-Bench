This is a bit higher than the average normal body temperature of 36.5°C to 37°C (97.7°F to 98.6°F), but it is not necessarily indicative of a fever. However, normal body temperature can vary slightly from person to person and can also be influenced by factors such as the time of day and the method of measurement.\n\nIf you or someone for whom you are caring has a temperature slightly above the normal range, it's important to monitor for other symptoms, stay hydrated, and rest.
