This underexposure allows the sky's detail to be retained, but as a result, the details in the shadows are lost, making the buildings and the plaza appear silhouetted.\n\nIn the image on the right, the exposure has been adjusted to brighten the scene. This brings out the details in the buildings and the plaza, providing a more balanced exposure across the entire frame. The sky is still well-exposed without being overblown, which suggests the use of a technique such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) processing, or careful manual blending of exposures, to maintain detail in both the brightest and darkest parts of the image.\n\nThe purpose of showing these two images side by side is likely to demonstrate the effect of different exposure settings or post-processing techniques on the final appearance of a photograph.",
