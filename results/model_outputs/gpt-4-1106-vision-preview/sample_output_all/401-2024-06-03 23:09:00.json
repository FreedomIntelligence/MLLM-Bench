The leaves are depicted in various shades of green, with some leaves having a lighter, almost teal or blue-green color.\n\nThe flowers are not botanically accurate representations but rather artistic interpretations. Some of the flowers have large, open petals, while others are more trumpet-shaped or have a star-like appearance. The pattern is repetitive, creating a continuous and harmonious design that could be used for fabric, wallpaper, or other decorative surfaces. The overall effect is vibrant and colorful with a natural, organic feel.",
