The next move of the fox would probably be to leap into the air and dive headfirst into the snow to try to capture its prey. This hunting technique involves the fox using its acute hearing to detect the movements of rodents under the snowpack and then using a combination of its pinpointed leap and momentum to break through the snow to reach the animal below. The objective of this action is to secure a meal, which is crucial for survival, especially in the challenging conditions of a wintry habitat.",
