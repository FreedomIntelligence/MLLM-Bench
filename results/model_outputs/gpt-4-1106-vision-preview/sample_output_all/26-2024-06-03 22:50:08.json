This position might cause strain on her neck, back, and shoulders over time. Here are some suggestions to improve her writing posture:\n\n1. Sit back in the chair: She should try to sit back in her chair with her back straight and supported by the chair's backrest. This helps maintain a better posture and reduces strain.\n\n2. Adjust the chair and table height: The chair and table should be at a height where her feet can rest flat on the ground, and her arms can comfortably write on the table without having to reach up or bend too far down.\n\n3. Keep the paper closer: The paper or notebook should be closer to the edge of the table to avoid leaning too far forward.\n\n4. Hold the pencil correctly: She should make sure she's holding the pencil in a way that doesn't cause her hand to tense up. There should be a relaxed grip.\n\n5. Take frequent breaks: It's important to take short breaks to stretch and adjust her position to avoid cramping and fatigue.\n\n6. Use a slanted surface: If possible, writing on a slightly slanted surface can help maintain a more natural position for the arms and hands.\n\nBy following these suggestions, she can improve her writing posture and maintain comfort during longer periods of writing or drawing.",
