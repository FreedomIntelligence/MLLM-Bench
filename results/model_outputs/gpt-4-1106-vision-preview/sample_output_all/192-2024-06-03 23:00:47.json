The findings suggest a high likelihood of hypertension as an underlying cause, although other etiologies cannot be excluded without further clinical correlation.\n- Urgent neurosurgical evaluation is recommended given the mass effect and potential for herniation.\n- Further assessment with a contrast-enhanced study or additional imaging modalities like MRI may be considered after initial management to evaluate for underlying vascular anomalies or other pathologies.\n- Close clinical monitoring for neurological status and intracranial pressure management is indicated.\n\nNote: This impression is based solely on the provided image and should be correlated with clinical findings and history for accurate diagnosis and management.",
