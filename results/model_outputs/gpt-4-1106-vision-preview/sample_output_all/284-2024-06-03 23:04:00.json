This is a centuries-old fishing method where fishermen use trained cormorants, a type of bird, to fish in rivers. The birds are typically tied with a snare near the base of their throat to prevent them from swallowing larger fish, which are then retrieved by the fisherman. This practice is known to have been used in various parts of Asia including China and Japan. The traditional attire and the presence of the birds on the pole he carries are indicative of this unique fishing technique. The setting appears to be a calm river or lake with a mountainous backdrop, which is consistent with locations where cormorant fishing is practiced.",
