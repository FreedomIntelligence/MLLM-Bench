Usage: Frequent use can cause wear and tear, particularly if the headset is regularly adjusted or stretched when being put on or taken off.\n3. Sweat and oils: Contact with skin oils and sweat can break down certain materials over time, especially if the headset is used during exercise or in warm environments.\n4. Environmental factors: Exposure to sunlight or heat can accelerate the degradation of certain materials.\n5. Quality of materials: Lower quality materials may not be as durable and can deteriorate faster than high-quality alternatives.\n\nGiven the type of wear, it is likely that the headset has been used extensively and may have been exposed to some combination of the factors listed above.
