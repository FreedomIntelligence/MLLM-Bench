Tiger: The tiger is shown with a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. It has a muscular body, a large head, and a long tail. Tigers are known for their powerful build and are typically the largest species of the cat family.\n\n2. Lion: The male lion is easily recognized by its mane, which frames its face and extends down its neck and chest. The mane's color can vary from light to dark. The body of the lion is robust and muscular, with a tawny coat and a tuft at the end of its tail.\n\n3. Leopard: The leopard is depicted with a golden, spotted coat. The spots are called rosettes because their shape resembles that of a rose. Leopards have a sleek, agile body that is built for climbing and stealth.\n\n4. Puma (also known as a mountain lion or cougar): This big cat has a uniform tan or tawny coat without spots, which helps it blend into its environment. It has a slender body and a long tail that is often used for balance. Pumas are versatile and can adapt to various habitats across the Americas.\n\nEach of these big cats has adapted to their respective environments and developed unique physical traits that aid in their survival and hunting strategies.",
