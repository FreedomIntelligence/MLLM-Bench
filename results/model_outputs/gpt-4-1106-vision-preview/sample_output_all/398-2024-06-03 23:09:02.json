The trend shown is an increase in body mass from left to right for both the male and female figures. This change could be illustrating a concept such as weight gain over time due to factors like a sedentary lifestyle, overeating, or other health-related issues. The figures start out lean and muscular or slim and become progressively larger, with the last figures on the right showing a body type that is overweight or obese. The reasons for such a trend can vary widely, but common factors include changes in diet, exercise habits, metabolism, and other lifestyle choices.",
