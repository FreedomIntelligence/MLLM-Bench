They are also valued for their softness and eco-friendly properties, as bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource.\n\nWhen new, both types of towels will generally have good absorbency, but bamboo towels might have a slight edge in absorbency due to the nature of bamboo fibers, which can be more absorbent than cotton fibers. However, the specific absorbency can vary based on the weave, the quality of the material, and the manufacturing process.
