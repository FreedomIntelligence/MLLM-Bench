This piece fits because it has an outward tab on the top and an inward slot on the right side, matching the surrounding pieces' configurations.\n\nNow, let's solve the arithmetic puzzle:\n\nFrom the first row, we can see that 1 apple equals 1 (since 1 apple + 1 apple equals 2).\nFrom the second row, we can see that 1 banana equals 1 (since 1 apple + 3 bananas equals 4, and we already know 1 apple equals 1, so 3 bananas equals 3).\nFrom the third row, we can deduce the value of the strawberries. We have 1 banana (which we know is 1) and some number of strawberries equaling 7. Since 1 banana equals 1, the strawberries must equal 6 (because 1 + 6 equals 7).\n\nNow we can calculate the arithmetic expression given:\n(1 apple + 3 bananas) x 2 strawberries = (1 + 3) x 6 = 4 x 6 = 24.\n\nSo the answer to the arithmetic is 24.",
