The situation is ironic because the person who expresses a dislike for dogs is juxtaposed with an image of a dog in the driver's seat, implying that the dog is in control of the situation and is ironically \"ejecting\" the disapproving passenger from the car. The dog is also depicted with a smug expression, which adds to the absurdity of the scenario. Additionally, the phrase \"This is the way!\" is a catchphrase from the TV series \"The Mandalorian,\" which is often used to affirm a course of action or a principle. Here, it humorously reinforces the dog's decision to remove the dog-disliking passenger, as if it were a universally accepted principle. The humor style is a blend of pop culture reference and anthropomorphism, where an animal is given human-like agency and behavior.",
