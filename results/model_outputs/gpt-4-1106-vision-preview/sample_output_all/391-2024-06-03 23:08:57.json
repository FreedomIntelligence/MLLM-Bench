While I can't use these specific models to predict future automotive designs, I can discuss current trends that may influence future designs.\n\n1. **Electrification**: As environmental concerns and regulations become more stringent, there is a significant push towards electric vehicles (EVs). Future designs are likely to reflect the need for better aerodynamics to improve range, space for battery storage, and features that cater to electric propulsion.\n\n2. **Autonomous Technology**: Many modern vehicles incorporate advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and there's a clear trajectory towards fully autonomous vehicles. This could lead to a radical shift in car design, where the interior becomes more of a living space, and the traditional front-facing seats could be replaced with more versatile arrangements.\n\n3. **Connectivity**: Vehicles are increasingly becoming connected to the internet and other devices. Future designs may emphasize this connectivity with more integrated screens, interfaces, and features that support constant communication and updates.\n\n4. **Sustainability**: Materials and manufacturing processes are likely to evolve to reduce environmental impact. This could mean more use of recycled materials, sustainable composites, and designs that are easier to recycle at the end of the vehicle's life.\n\n5. **Modularity**: There's a growing trend towards modular designs that allow for easy customization and upgrades. Future vehicles might offer interchangeable parts or add-ons that can be swapped out as technology or styles change.\n\n6. **Compact and Efficient Design**: In urban environments, where space is at a premium, smaller and more efficient car designs are likely to be popular. This could manifest in compact city cars and vehicles designed for shared transportation networks.\n\n7. **Aerodynamics**: As efficiency becomes increasingly important, car designs will continue to be influenced by the need to reduce drag. This could mean smoother lines, fewer protrusions, and more integrated components.\n\n8. **Safety**: With advancements in materials science and crash-prevention technologies, future vehicles will likely incorporate improved safety features, which may also influence their design aesthetics.\n\n9. **Personalization**: With the rise of digital manufacturing techniques like 3D printing, future car designs might offer greater scope for personalization, allowing buyers to customize aspects of the car's appearance and features to their preferences.\n\n10. **Integration with Other Modes of Transportation**: Future designs might reflect a more holistic approach to transportation, with cars designed to integrate seamlessly with public transport systems and other mobility solutions.\n\nThese trends suggest that future automotive designs will likely be sleeker, more efficient, and packed with technology that enhances the driving experience, safety, and sustainability.",
