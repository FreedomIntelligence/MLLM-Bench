Corn typically requires a warm climate with a growing season that provides enough warmth and sunlight. The presence of lush vegetation and the fact that the corn has reached maturity suggest that the area likely experiences a warm growing season with adequate moisture.\n\nThe clothing worn by the individuals, which includes hats and long sleeves, could suggest a sunny and potentially warm climate, prompting the need for protection from the sun.
