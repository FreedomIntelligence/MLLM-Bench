The flower to the left of the dog has an extra petal in the left image compared to the right image.\n4. The doghouse in the left image has a dark brown patch on its roof, which is not present in the right image.\n5. The water bowl in the left image is empty, while in the right image it is full with a bone in it.\n6. There is a snail in the bottom right corner of the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n7.
