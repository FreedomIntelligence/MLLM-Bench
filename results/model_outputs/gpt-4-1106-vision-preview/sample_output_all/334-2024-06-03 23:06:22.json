The grip appears to be unraveling from the handle, exposing the underlying material, which could be either wood or composite.\n\nHere are some suggestions for repairing the grip of the racquet:\n\n1. Remove the old grip: Carefully unwrap and remove any remaining parts of the old grip from the handle. If there's any adhesive residue, clean it off with a bit of alcohol or grip solvent.\n\n2. Choose a replacement grip: Purchase a new replacement grip that suits your preferences for thickness, texture, and material. There are various types of grips available, including synthetic grips for durability and towel grips for better sweat absorption.\n\n3. Apply the new grip: Start by peeling the protective film off the adhesive side of the new grip. Begin wrapping the grip from the base of the handle, making sure to keep it tight and smooth as you wrap it around the handle. Overlap each turn slightly to ensure complete coverage and a secure fit.\n\n4. Secure the grip: Once you've reached the top of the handle, cut off any excess grip material. Use the finishing tape provided with the grip (or some electrical tape) to secure the end of the grip to the handle.\n\n5. Inspect and adjust: After applying the new grip, inspect it to make sure there are no loose ends or uneven areas. If necessary, adjust the grip by carefully unwrapping and rewrapping it until you're satisfied with the fit and feel.\n\nIf you're not comfortable doing this yourself, you can always take your racquet to a sports store or a professional stringer, who can re-grip it for you.",
