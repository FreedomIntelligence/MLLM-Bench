The lack of heavy equipment and apparent absence of a team suggests that the efficiency of the debris-clearing operation may be limited, and the safety of the individual could be compromised due to the potential instability of the debris and lack of protective equipment.\n\nFor a safe and efficient rescue or clean-up operation, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and coordinated efforts involving trained personnel and appropriate machinery are typically required. The scene in the image does not seem to reflect these standards, which raises concerns about the safety of the individual and the effectiveness of the operation.",
