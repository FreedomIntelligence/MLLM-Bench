Based on his body position and the momentum suggested by the image, his next move might involve completing the aerial maneuver and then landing back on the ramp. The precise trick being performed isn't clear from the still image, but common skateboarding aerials include grabs, flips, and spins.\n\nThe risk of such actions can be high, as they require precise timing, body control, and experience. The skater must judge the landing accurately to avoid falling, which can lead to injuries. Protective gear such as a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads can mitigate the risk of injury, although they are not visible in this image. The skater's level of skill and familiarity with the ramp will also influence the risk level of the maneuver.",
