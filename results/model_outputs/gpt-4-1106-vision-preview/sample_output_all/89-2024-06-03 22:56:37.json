Here are the items that reflect this style:\n\n1. The wood paneling on the wall has a clean, linear pattern that is characteristic of modern design, which often features strong lines and geometric forms.\n\n2. The pendant light fixture with a simple, round shape and brass finish hints at mid-century modern design, which frequently incorporates metallic finishes and organic shapes.\n\n3. The art pieces within circular frames on the wood panel wall also have a mid-century modern aesthetic due to their simple geometric designs and the use of brass.\n\n4. The overall color palette is neutral, which is common in modern and minimalist interiors, emphasizing simplicity and a lack of clutter.\n\n5. The furniture, such as the bed and the small sculpture on the bed, has a sleek and simple design, further contributing to the minimalist feel.\n\n6. The perforated screen or partition allows light to filter through in a patterned way, adding a decorative yet functional element that aligns with modern design principles of form following function.\n\n7. The round mirror with a thin frame is another element that complements the minimalist aesthetic, avoiding heavy ornamentation in favor of clean, simple lines.",
