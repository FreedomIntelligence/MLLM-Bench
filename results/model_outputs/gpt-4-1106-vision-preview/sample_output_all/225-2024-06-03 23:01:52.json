In the first food chain, energy flows from the trees, which are the producers, to the deer, which are the primary consumers (herbivores). The deer consume the plants to gain energy. Then, the energy flows from the deer to the lion, which is the secondary consumer (carnivore). The lion gains energy by consuming the deer.\n\n2. The second food chain starts with the flower as the producer. Flies, which are the primary consumers, feed on the flower or its nectar. The frog, a secondary consumer, gains energy by eating the flies. Finally, the snake, a tertiary consumer, feeds on the frog, and the eagle, a quaternary consumer, preys on the snake.\n\n3. In the third food chain, the energy begins with the flower (aquatic plants) as the producer. Small fishes act as primary consumers by feeding on the plants. A larger fish, as a secondary consumer, eats the small fishes. Finally, a bird, which is a tertiary consumer, consumes the larger fish to obtain energy.\n\nIn each of these food chains, energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, with a decrease in energy at each successive level due to energy being lost as heat and through metabolic processes.",
