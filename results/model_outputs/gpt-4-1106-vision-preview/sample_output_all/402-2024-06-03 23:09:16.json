The composition is dynamic, with the subject placed off-center, creating a diagonal line that leads the viewer's eye through the image. This placement also provides a sense of depth, as the subject seems to be moving towards the foreground.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by shades of blue, which convey a serene yet vibrant underwater environment. The blue tones also create a strong contrast with the subject's skin and the dollar bill, making these elements stand out and draw the viewer's attention.\n\nLighting plays a crucial role in the image, with the underwater light creating a dappled effect on the subject's skin and casting shadows that add texture and realism to the scene. The light source from above the water creates a sense of directionality and highlights the ripples and gentle waves on the surface, contributing to the feeling of motion.\n\nOverall, the artistic elements of the photograph work together to create a captivating and thought-provoking image that leaves a lasting impression. The combination of movement, color, and lighting invites the viewer to consider the narrative and symbolism behind the photograph.",
