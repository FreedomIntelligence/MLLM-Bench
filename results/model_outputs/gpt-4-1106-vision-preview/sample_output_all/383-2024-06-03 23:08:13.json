Based on his current posture and the physics of skateboarding, his next move is likely to involve coming back down towards the ramp, aiming to land smoothly on the curved surface with his skateboard wheels first. He might be attempting to maintain his momentum to continue skating through the park, possibly setting up for another trick.\n\nThe risk associated with this action includes the potential for a fall if the skater does not correctly time his landing or if he loses balance upon impact with the ramp. Falls can result in injuries ranging from minor scrapes and bruises to more serious injuries such as fractures or concussions, especially if protective gear is not worn. The level of risk also depends on the skater's experience, skill level, and familiarity with the skatepark's layout.",
