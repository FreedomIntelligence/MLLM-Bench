This is a compound exercise that targets the chest muscles (pectoralis major), as well as the shoulders (deltoids), triceps, and to a lesser extent, the back muscles.\n\nTechnical essentials of the barbell bench press include:\n\n1. Starting Position: Lie flat on a bench with your feet planted firmly on the ground. Your back should have a natural arch, and your shoulder blades retracted to create a stable base.\n\n2. Grip: Grasp the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Your wrists should be straight, and your thumbs should wrap around the bar for safety.\n\n3. Lift-off: Unrack the barbell with the help of a spotter if available, and position it above your chest with your arms fully extended.\n\n4. Descent: Lower the barbell in a controlled manner to the midpoint of your chest, usually around the nipple line. Keep your elbows at about a 45- to 75-degree angle from your sides.\n\n5. Press: Drive the barbell back up to the starting position by extending your arms fully, exhaling as you push. The bar should move in a straight line vertically.\n\n6. Repeat: Perform the desired number of repetitions maintaining form and control throughout the set.\n\nSafety is paramount when performing the bench press, so it's advised to have a spotter, especially when lifting heavy weights. Proper warm-up and gradually increasing the weight can help prevent injury.",
