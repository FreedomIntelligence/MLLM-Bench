The speaker argues that these exams are essential for providing equal opportunities, helping students grow, and offering a uniform evaluation of student knowledge and skills.\n\nThe speaker uses several rhetorical devices:\n\n1. Hypophora: This is when the speaker poses a question and then immediately answers it. An example is, \"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college? What criteria will universities follow to admit students?\"\n\n2. Anaphora: This is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. In the speech, \"They have parents’ with higher social status, they have better connections (Anaphora).\"\n\n3. Antithesis: This device juxtaposes contrasting ideas in a balanced manner. The speaker uses antithesis when saying, \"Your family or money doesn't help here – it's all about how much you study and what you can do (Antithesis).\"\n\n4. Ethos: The speaker appeals to ethos by citing Einstein's view on the purpose of education, thus attempting to build credibility by referencing a respected figure.\n\n5. Metaphor: The speaker uses a metaphor at the end by stating, \"They’re not just tests, but keys to the future (Metaphor).\"\n\nThe speech aims to persuade the audience that college entrance exams are beneficial despite the stress they may cause, using a combination of logical arguments and rhetorical techniques to make a compelling case.",
