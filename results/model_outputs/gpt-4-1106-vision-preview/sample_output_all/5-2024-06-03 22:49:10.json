A space heater is designed to heat a room or space by emitting warmth, typically through electrical resistance, and often includes features like thermostats and safety shut-offs. It may also use infrared technology to generate heat. A general fan, on the other hand, works by moving air around to create a cooling effect through the evaporation of sweat on the skin, but it does not actually lower the temperature of the air. The image also shows a remote control, indicating that this heater can be controlled remotely.",
