The front grille is also missing, and the impact appears to have caused the front axle to be displaced, given the unnatural angle of the front wheels.\n\nThe heat from the fire will compromise the strength of the metal and other materials, potentially warping or melting components. The interior of the car, including the dashboard, seats, and any plastic or fabric, will be extensively damaged or completely destroyed by the flames. The windshield is also likely to crack or shatter due to the intense heat.\n\nIn summary, the vehicle has sustained serious structural damage from both the collision and the fire, with the most severe damage likely being in the front half of the car where the fire is concentrated.",
