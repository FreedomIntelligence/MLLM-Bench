The fox's next move is likely to be a pounce, where it jumps and dives headfirst into the snow to try to catch its prey. This hunting technique is based on the fox's acute hearing, allowing it to detect animals moving under the snow. The objective of this action is to secure a meal, which is crucial for survival, especially in the challenging conditions of a wintry habitat.",
