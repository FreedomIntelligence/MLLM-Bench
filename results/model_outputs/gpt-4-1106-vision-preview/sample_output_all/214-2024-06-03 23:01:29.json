The p-value of 0.0004 suggests that this correlation is statistically significant.\n\nThe R-square value of 0.225 indicates that approximately 22.5% of the variability in excess deaths can be explained by the vaccination rate alone, suggesting that there are other factors also affecting the excess deaths which are not captured in this simple linear model.\n\nThe OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) slope of -0.59 indicates that for each percentage point increase in the vaccination rate, there is an associated decrease of 0.59 in the excess deaths for a state.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can use the OLS slope and the trend line in the graph. Although the exact intercept is not given, we can visually estimate the point on the trend line corresponding to an 85% vaccination rate.\n\nBy visually tracing a line up from the 85% mark on the x-axis to the trend line and then across to the y-axis, it appears that the excess deaths would be approximately in the low 20s.

It's important to note that the actual value could be somewhat different, as individual data points show a fair amount of variability around the trend line.",
