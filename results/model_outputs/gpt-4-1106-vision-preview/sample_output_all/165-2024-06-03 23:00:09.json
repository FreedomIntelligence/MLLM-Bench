The event is advertised with two dates: the main release on December 1, 2023, and an early access fan event on November 29, 2023.\n\nAs a marketing tool, the poster is effective in several ways:\n\n1. Visual Impact: The poster has a strong visual presence with a dynamic image of Godzilla that captures attention. The use of contrasting colors (black and turquoise) creates a bold and vibrant look that stands out.\n\n2. Brand Recognition: The iconic silhouette of Godzilla is immediately recognizable to fans of the franchise, which helps in connecting with the target audience.\n\n3. Experience Highlight: The text \"FEEL IT IN 4DX\" is prominently displayed, emphasizing the unique sensory experience that the 4DX format offers. This can intrigue potential viewers who are looking for a more immersive cinematic experience.\n\n4. Event Information: The poster clearly presents the important dates for the early access fan event and the general release, making it easy for viewers to know when they can participate.\n\n5. Licensing and Copyright: The poster includes the necessary copyright and licensing information at the bottom, indicating that it is an official promotional material.\n\nOverall, the poster effectively promotes the event by leveraging the appeal of the Godzilla brand and the novelty of the 4DX experience. It is likely to generate interest and excitement among fans of the series and moviegoers looking for an enhanced viewing experience.",
