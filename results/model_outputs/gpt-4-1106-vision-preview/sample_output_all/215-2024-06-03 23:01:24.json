The various lines represent different datasets or analyses from different sources, such as HadCRUT5, NOAA GlobalTemp, Kadok et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5, with their respective time spans indicated in parentheses.\n\nThe chart implies that there has been a general trend of increasing global temperatures since the late 19th century. The temperature anomaly, which is the deviation from the 1850-1900 average, appears to have been relatively stable or slightly fluctuating around the baseline in the early part of the record, but it begins to show a more pronounced upward trend starting in the 20th century, particularly from the mid-20th century onwards.\n\nThe convergence of the different datasets around similar values suggests a consensus among the various analyses regarding the trend of rising temperatures. The upward trend is consistent with scientific understanding of global warming, attributed largely to the increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere due to human activities.",
