Tiger: On the top left, the tiger is characterized by its large size, muscular build, and distinctive coat pattern with dark vertical stripes on a reddish-orange background with a lighter underside. The tiger's face shows the characteristic feline features, such as whiskers and sharp teeth.\n\n2. Lion: Dominating the center of the image is a male lion, easily identifiable by its impressive mane, which frames its face and extends down its neck and chest. The lion's coat is a tawny color without the stripes or spots found on some other big cats. The mane is a unique feature to male lions and is a sign of maturity and health.\n\n3. Cougar (Mountain Lion): To the top right, the cougar is depicted with a smaller head and a sleek body. The cougar's coat is a uniform tan or light cinnamon color, without the spots or stripes of the other big cats in the illustration. This cat is known for its agility and strength.\n\n4. Lioness with Cubs: At the bottom right, there is a lioness shown with her cubs. The lioness lacks the mane that the male lion has, and her body is built more for hunting with a leaner physique. The cubs resemble the adult in color but may have faint spots or lighter fur, which they typically lose as they mature.\n\nEach of these big cats has evolved specific features that help them adapt to their respective environments and hunting styles. The illustration captures the diversity within the big cat family in terms of size, coat patterns, and physical adaptations.",
