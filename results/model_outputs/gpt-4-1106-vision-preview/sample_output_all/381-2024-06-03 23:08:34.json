This is a powerful overhead stroke played with a lot of force, typically directed downwards into the opponent's court.

The player executes the jump smash towards the opponents' side of the court.\n2. The opposing team attempts to defend the smash with a lift or a block to the back or front of the court, respectively.\n3. If the smash is returned with a lift, the attacking team may set up for another smash or a drop shot to mix up the pace and keep the opponents off-balance.\n4. If the smash is returned with a block, the attacking team might respond with a net shot to keep control of the net area.\n5. The rally continues with a series of drives, clears, and net plays as both teams vie for an advantageous position.\n6. The rally could end with a decisive shot such as a smash, a tight spinning net shot, or a deceptive drop shot, or it might continue with prolonged exchanges until one team makes an error or forces a weak return that can be capitalized upon.\n\nThis sequence is just one of many possible scenarios that could unfold, as the actual rally would depend on the skill, strategy, and reactions of the players involved.",
