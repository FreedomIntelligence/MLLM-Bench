This is an example of brood parasitism, where one species (the larger bird) lays its eggs in the nest of another species (the smaller bird), and the host species ends up raising the young of the parasitic bird.\n\nThe adult bird appears to be a Eurasian Reed Warbler (or a similar small passerine bird), and the young bird looks like a Common Cuckoo chick, which is known for this kind of parasitic behavior. The Reed Warbler is instinctively feeding the Cuckoo chick, likely because the chick has hatched in the Reed Warbler's nest and the adult bird is responding to the chick's begging behavior as if it were its own offspring.
