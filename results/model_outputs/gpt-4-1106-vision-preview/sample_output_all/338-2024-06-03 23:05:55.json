The impact on structural health is evident from the damaged and partially buried buildings, which suggests that the structures in the vicinity of the eruption have sustained significant damage due to pyroclastic flows, ash fall, or lahars (volcanic mudflows). This can result in the loss of homes, infrastructure, and critical facilities.\n\nThe environmental health impact is also severe. Volcanic ash can cover vast areas, destroying vegetation, polluting water sources, and making land unsuitable for agriculture. It can also lead to long-term health issues for the local population due to air and water contamination. The ash and other volcanic materials can disrupt ecosystems and harm wildlife. Recovery from such an event can take a long time and requires extensive cleanup and rehabilitation efforts.",
