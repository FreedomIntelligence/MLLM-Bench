The player presses keys with their fingers to open and close holes along the body of the instrument, changing the pitch. Different techniques, such as vibrato (a slight wavering of the note), overblowing (increasing air pressure to reach higher notes), and various tonguing techniques (how the tongue interacts with the reed to start a note) are used to create different sounds and effects.  The saxophone is common in jazz, classical, and popular music.\n",
