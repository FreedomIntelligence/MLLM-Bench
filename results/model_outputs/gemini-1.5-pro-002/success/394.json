This part reflects the real-world trend of selective breeding in the poultry industry leading to larger birds.\n\nHowever, the image then extrapolates this trend to absurd levels, culminating in chickens evolving into dinosaurs by 2025. This is not scientifically plausible. Evolution doesn't work that quickly, and chickens are not on an evolutionary path back to dinosaurs.  While birds are descended from dinosaurs, reversing that process over a few decades is impossible. The image is a joke playing on the idea of runaway growth trends.\n",
