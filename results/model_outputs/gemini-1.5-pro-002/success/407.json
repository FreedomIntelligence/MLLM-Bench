Next to them are three or four pieces of what looks like fried chicken, possibly wings or drumsticks, with a darker, crispier skin.  A pile of thin, golden-brown, battered and fried strips of something, perhaps fish or chicken, are also present.  Partially obscured behind these strips is a smaller, darker portion of food, possibly also fried, but it's difficult to determine what it is.\n\nTwo small condiment bowls are included on the plate. One contains a grainy, reddish-brown spice mix or powder.  The other holds a smooth, pale yellow sauce, likely a dipping sauce like mustard or honey mustard. Both bowls have small white spoons attached.  A sprig of parsley garnishes the plate near the fried strips.",
