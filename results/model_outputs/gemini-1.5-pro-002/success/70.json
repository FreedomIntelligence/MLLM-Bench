    "answer": "The man and woman on the right are wearing traditional Ghanaian Kente cloth. The man's attire, consisting of a large draped cloth over a plain shirt, is a common style for formal occasions.  The woman's outfit incorporates the Kente cloth into a more modern, fitted bodice and skirt. Her hair is styled up with decorative hairpins.\n\nThe presence of a book being read by another man, likely officiating, suggests this is a ceremony with a spoken component. Given the attire and the seemingly solemn atmosphere, it is likely a **traditional Ghanaian wedding ceremony** or possibly a **marriage blessing**.  The other man in plain white may be a best man or another member of the wedding party.\n",
