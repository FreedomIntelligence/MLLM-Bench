    "answer": "The image quality is low, exhibiting noticeable blurriness and a lack of sharpness. The possible causes include:\n\n* **Water turbidity:** Particles suspended in the water scatter light, reducing visibility and causing a hazy or blurry appearance. This is a common issue in underwater photography.\n* **Camera limitations:** The camera used might have a low resolution sensor or a less capable lens, leading to a softer image.\n* **Focus issues:** The camera might not have focused correctly on the coral, resulting in a blurred image.  Autofocus can struggle underwater.\n* **Motion blur:** Either the camera or the subject (coral) might have moved during the exposure, creating blur.  Even slight currents can cause this.\n* **Waterproof housing:** If a waterproof housing was used, water droplets or condensation on the housing's lens could significantly degrade image quality.\n* **Compression artifacts:**  If the image has been heavily compressed, this can also introduce blurriness.\n\nIt's likely a combination of factors, especially water turbidity and potentially focus issues, are contributing to the blurriness. Underwater photography presents unique challenges, and achieving sharp images often requires specialized equipment and techniques.\n",
