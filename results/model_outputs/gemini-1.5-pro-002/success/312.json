    "answer": "Here's how to calculate the integral:\n\n**1. Rewrite the integral:**\n\nThe integral can be written as:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (∫₀¹ 4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2) dy) dx\n\n**2. Integrate with respect to y:**\n\nSince the integrand doesn't contain y, integrating with respect to y simply multiplies the integrand by y and evaluates it from 0 to 1:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [ (4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2)) * y ]₀¹ dx\nI = ∫₀¹ (4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2)) dx\n\n**3. Recognize the problem:**\n\nThe function 1/(x - 1/2) has a vertical asymptote at x = 1/2, which is within the interval of integration [0, 1]. This means the integral is improper.  We need to investigate the behavior of the integral around this singularity.\n\n**4.  Consider the limit:**\n\nLet's consider the behavior of the integrand near x = 1/2:\n\nAs x approaches 1/2, sin²(πx) approaches sin²(π/2) = 1.  The term 4sin²(πx) approaches 4.\n\nTherefore, the integrand behaves like 4/(x-1/2) near x = 1/2.  This is of the form 1/(x-a), which is known to diverge when integrated across the singularity.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the integrand has a non-integrable singularity at x = 1/2, the integral *diverges*.  Therefore, the value of I is undefined or infinite. It does not converge to a finite value.",
