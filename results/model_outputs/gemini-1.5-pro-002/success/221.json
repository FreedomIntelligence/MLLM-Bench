    "answer": "The smaller fish, likely pilotfish, are swimming very close to the shark, even appearing to touch it.  They aren't being attacked because this relationship is mutually beneficial, a form of symbiosis called **mutualism**, specifically **cleaning symbiosis**.\n\nThe pilotfish eat parasites and dead skin from the shark's body, providing a cleaning service.  In return, the pilotfish get a free meal and protection from other predators who wouldn't dare approach a shark.  The shark benefits from improved hygiene and health.  The pilotfish are also thought to consume scraps of food left over from the shark's meals.\n",
