    "answer": "The visual metaphor of the dynamite bundle strapped to the baby in the \"How It Feels\" image exaggerates the challenge of putting a baby to sleep.  The left image shows the seemingly simple act of laying a baby down, while the right image replaces the baby's lower half with a ticking time bomb. This implies that the seemingly innocuous act of putting the baby down is fraught with peril; one wrong move, and the \"bomb\" might go off (i.e., the baby might wake up).\n\nThe humor comes from the hyperbole.  Putting a baby to sleep can be challenging, requiring patience and careful movements, but it's obviously not *literally* as dangerous as handling explosives.  The extreme exaggeration of the difficulty, comparing it to a life-or-death situation, creates a humorous disconnect.  Parents and caregivers can relate to the frustration and delicate maneuvering involved, making the absurd comparison funny and relatable.  The ticking timer further emphasizes the tension and impending \"explosion,\" adding to the comedic effect.\n",
