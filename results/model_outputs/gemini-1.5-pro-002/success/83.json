    "answer": "This bird is a Channel-billed Toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus). Key features include:\n\n* **Large, colorful bill:** The most striking feature is its long, down-curved bill.  It's predominantly black, with a splash of light blue along the top edge and cutting edge of the upper mandible.  The base of the upper mandible is ivory-white, blending into a vibrant yellow patch further down.  The lower mandible has a black tip and a dark blue base.\n* **Chest and upper belly:**  A rich, rusty-orange color covers the chest and upper belly.\n* **Lower belly and vent:** The lower belly transitions to a deep red-orange, almost crimson.\n* **Head and neck:** The head and neck are primarily black, contrasting sharply with the colorful bill and chest. A small patch of light blue skin surrounds the eye.\n* **Tail:** Long and primarily black, with some reddish-orange feathers peeking out from underneath.\n* **Wings:**  Mostly black.\n* **Size:** Toucans are relatively large birds. The Channel-billed Toucan can reach around 50-60 cm in length, a significant portion of which is the bill.\n* **Habitat:**  They are found in tropical forests of South America.\n\nThe combination of the large, colorful bill, black head and body, and the orange/red chest and belly make this toucan quite distinctive.  The specific pattern of colors on the bill helps distinguish it from other toucan species.\n",
