    "answer": "The expression is:\n\n∫ 2x / (x+1)(x² + 1)² dx\n\nThis integral can be solved using partial fraction decomposition. Here's how:\n\n1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**\nWe want to decompose the integrand into simpler fractions.  The form will be:\n\n2x / (x+1)(x² + 1)² = A/(x+1) + (Bx+C)/(x²+1) + (Dx+E)/(x²+1)²\n\n2. **Solve for Coefficients:**\nMultiply both sides by (x+1)(x² + 1)² to clear the denominators:\n\n2x = A(x²+1)² + (Bx+C)(x+1)(x²+1) + (Dx+E)(x+1)\n\nNow, solve for A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done by strategically substituting values for x (like x = -1 to easily find A) and comparing coefficients of like terms (x⁴, x³, x², x, and constant terms).\n\nAfter solving, you'll find:\n* A = -1/2\n* B = 1/2\n* C = 1/2\n* D = 0\n* E = -1\n\n3. **Integrate the Decomposed Fractions:**\nNow, substitute the values of A, B, C, D, and E back into the decomposed form and integrate each term separately:\n\n∫ [-1/2(x+1)] + [(1/2)x + 1/2]/(x²+1) + [-1]/(x²+1)² dx\n\nEach of these integrals can be solved using known integration techniques:\n* ∫ -1/2(x+1) dx = -(1/2)ln|x+1|\n* ∫ [(1/2)x]/(x²+1) dx = (1/4)ln(x²+1)\n* ∫ (1/2)/(x²+1) dx = (1/2)arctan(x)\n* ∫ -1/(x²+1)² dx  This one requires a trigonometric substitution (x = tan(u)) and will result in -(1/2)(arctan(x) + x/(x²+1))\n\n4. **Combine and Simplify:**\nCombine the results of the individual integrals to get the final answer. After simplification, the final answer is:\n\n-(1/2)ln|x+1| + (1/4)ln(x²+1) - x/2(x²+1) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the integral is **-(1/2)ln|x+1| + (1/4)ln(x²+1) - x/2(x²+1) + C**.\n",
