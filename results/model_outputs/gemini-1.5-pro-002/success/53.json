    "answer": "This is the Sydney Opera House, a masterpiece of **Expressionist architecture**.  Danish architect Jørn Utzon conceived its iconic design.\n\n* **Architectural Style:**  Expressionism, specifically late Modern Expressionism. It moves away from strict functionalism and embraces sculptural, organic forms.  The building's sail-like shells are a dramatic departure from traditional architectural shapes, prioritizing artistic expression and evoking emotional responses.\n\n* **Design Concept:** Utzon's design was inspired by several sources, including:\n    * **Nature:** The shells resemble the segments of an orange, or perhaps the billowing sails of ships on Sydney Harbour.  This connection to the natural world is a key element of Expressionism.\n    * **Pre-cast concrete technology:**  While the shapes appear complex, Utzon sought a modular system for construction.  He envisioned the shells as prefabricated concrete segments, though realizing this proved technically challenging.  The final solution involved complex geometric calculations and innovative construction techniques.\n    * **Swedish architecture:** Utzon admired the simplicity and functionality of Swedish design, which likely influenced the underlying principles of the Opera House, even as its outward appearance is far more expressive.\n    * **Maya architecture:** Some scholars have also noted similarities between the Opera House shells and certain Mayan temples, suggesting a possible, though less documented, influence.\n\nThe image itself shows a temporary projection of poppies onto the sails, likely commemorating Remembrance Day. This doesn't alter the underlying architectural style but demonstrates the building's capacity to serve as a canvas for artistic expression, further highlighting its Expressionist nature.\n",
