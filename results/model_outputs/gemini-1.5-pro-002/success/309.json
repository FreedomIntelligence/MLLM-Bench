However, **we can't be certain from the image alone**.  It might not be well-insulated, or it could have a metal exterior section that conducts heat.\n\nTherefore, while it's *likely* safe to hold, **it's best to assume it could be hot and exercise caution** until you can confirm the mug's specific features and heat retention properties.\n",
