The front bumper also appears damaged and partially detached on the driver's side.  It's impossible to determine the extent of damage to the frame or internal components from this image.\n\nThe fire is primarily concentrated in the engine compartment of the gray car.  Flames are engulfing the engine bay and extending out from under the hood and through the front windshield.  While the red car is close to the flames, it doesn't appear to be burning yet, though radiant heat is likely causing damage.  The front end of the gray car will experience the most severe fire damage, including the engine, wiring, dashboard, and front passenger compartment.",
