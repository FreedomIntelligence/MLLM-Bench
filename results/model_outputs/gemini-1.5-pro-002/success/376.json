    "answer": "A stacked area chart would be an excellent way to visualize this data.  Here's why and how:\n\n**Why a Stacked Area Chart?**\n\n* **Shows change over time:** The data represents percentage share over different time periods (Finance Commissions), making a time-series visualization appropriate.\n* **Comparison across categories:** You can easily compare the changing share of each state over time.\n* **Overall trend:** The total area of the chart represents the total allocation, and you can see how this changes over the different periods.\n* **Individual contribution:** The area for each state within the stack shows its relative contribution to the total in each period.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1. **X-axis:**  Finance Commission periods (Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, etc.)\n2. **Y-axis:** Percentage share of Union Taxes and Duties.\n3. **Stacked Areas:** Each state gets its own colored area within the stack.  Use distinct colors for easy differentiation.\n4. **Legend:** Clearly label each state's color in a legend.\n5. **Title:** A descriptive title like \"% Share of Union Taxes and Duties Allocated to States over Time\" would be appropriate.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Ordering of states:** Arrange the states in the stack from largest to smallest average share (or some other meaningful order) for better readability.\n* **Interactive elements:** If possible, make the chart interactive so users can hover over areas to see the exact percentage for a specific state in a given period.\n* **Highlighting key states:** If you want to focus on specific states, you could use bolder colors or callouts for those areas.\n* **Simplifying the chart:** If the chart becomes too cluttered with all states, you could group smaller states into an \"Other\" category or create separate charts for different regions of India.\n\nBy using a stacked area chart and incorporating these considerations, you can effectively present the data in a visually appealing and insightful manner.\n",
