He's clearly upset about something he's hearing or experiencing on the phone call.\n\nSeveral things could lead to this expression:\n\n* **A frustrating conversation:** He could be dealing with a difficult client, a confusing automated system, bad news, or an argument with someone on the other end of the line.\n* **Technical difficulties:**  Perhaps the connection is bad, he keeps getting disconnected, or he can't understand the person he's talking to.\n* **Stressful situation:** The phone call could be related to a high-stakes situation, like a critical business deal, a family emergency, or a time-sensitive problem.\n* **Personal issues:**  While the context suggests a work-related scenario, underlying personal stress could be exacerbating his reaction to the phone call.\n",
