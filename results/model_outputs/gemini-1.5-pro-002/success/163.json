    "answer": "This speech argues for the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.  The speaker presents three main reasons: fairness, growth, and standardized evaluation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the rhetorical codes used:\n\n* **Logos (Logic):** The speaker uses logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, they argue that without entrance exams, admission would be based on factors like family background, creating an unfair system. They also point out that standardized exams provide a consistent way to evaluate students compared to varying school grading systems.\n\n* **Pathos (Emotion):**  The speaker appeals to emotion by highlighting the opportunity entrance exams provide for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to change their fates. This evokes a sense of hope and emphasizes the potential for upward mobility.\n\n* **Ethos (Credibility):** The speaker uses a quote from Einstein to bolster their argument about the importance of learning beyond memorization.  Invoking a respected figure lends credibility to their point about the value of these exams in fostering critical thinking.\n\n* **Hypophora:** The speaker poses questions and then immediately answers them. This is evident when they ask how universities would admit students without exams and then suggest it would likely be based on family background. This technique engages the audience and guides them through the speaker's reasoning.\n\n* **Anaphora:** The repetition of \"they have\" when describing the advantages of students from privileged backgrounds emphasizes the disparity and strengthens the argument for fairness.\n\n* **Antithesis:** The contrast between family background/money and hard work/ability highlights the fairness of entrance exams as a level playing field.\n\n* **Metaphor:**  Referring to the exams as \"keys to the future\" creates a vivid image of opportunity and potential. This metaphor reinforces the importance of these exams in shaping students' futures.",
