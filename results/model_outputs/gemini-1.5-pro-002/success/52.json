Some notable examples connected to the mountain and its nearby lakes and towns include:\n\n* **Fujiyoshida Fire Festival:** Held in late August in Fujiyoshida City, this festival features enormous torches lining the streets to celebrate the end of Mount Fuji's climbing season.\n\n* **Yamanakako Hanabi Taikai (Lake Yamanaka Fireworks Festival):**  One of the largest fireworks displays in Japan, held on Lake Yamanaka during the summer.  While not directly *on* Fuji, the mountain provides a spectacular backdrop.\n\n* **Kawaguchiko Autumn Leaves Festival:** Celebrated around Lake Kawaguchiko (seen in the picture) during the peak autumn foliage season.  Events include illuminated autumn leaves and other festivities.\n\n* **Shibazakura Festival:** Held near Fuji Five Lakes (including Lake Motosuko), this festival showcases stunning fields of pink moss phlox (shibazakura) with Mount Fuji as a backdrop.\n\nIt's important to note that many smaller local festivals and events also take place in the towns and villages surrounding Mount Fuji, often celebrating the mountain, the seasons, or local traditions.  The specific events vary from year to year, so checking local listings is always recommended.\n",
