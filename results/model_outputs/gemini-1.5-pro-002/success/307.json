While not ideal compared to dedicated running shoes, they offer more support and cushioning than the other options present. They appear to be made of leather and possibly have some sort of waterproof membrane, which could be beneficial in certain weather conditions.  However, it's impossible to tell the specific features or construction of the boots from the image.\n\nIt's important to note that none of the shoes pictured appear to be specifically designed for long-distance running.
