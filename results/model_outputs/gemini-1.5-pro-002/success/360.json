    "answer": "Toby burrowed deeper under his covers.  The hot air balloon painted on his wall seemed to mock him.  He was supposed to be soaring through multiplication tables, not hiding from them.  Seven times five.  He squeezed his eyes shut. Thirty… something.\n\nA thought bubble, fluffy and insistent, popped up above his head. Inside, his dog, Rusty, sat at a school desk, paw raised confidently.  “Thirty-five!” barked cartoon Rusty.  He was wearing a red collar, just like the real Rusty sleeping peacefully under Toby's bed.  Cartoon Rusty was surrounded by other kids, including a girl with bright yellow hair who looked suspiciously like Lily from his class. They all seemed to understand the mysteries of multiplication.\n\nToby groaned.  Even his dog, in his imagination, was better at maths than him.  He peeked out from under the covers. Real Rusty, oblivious to his dream-world brilliance, twitched his nose and let out a soft snore.  A chewed bone lay beside him on the patchwork rug.\n\nToby sighed. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever.  Mrs. Higgins, his teacher, had warned them about the “times table test” on Monday.  He imagined Mrs. Higgins, also in his thought bubble, now towering over cartoon Rusty, who was shrinking smaller and smaller with each terrifying “seven times six?”\n\nHe kicked his legs under the duvet, accidentally hitting a toy airplane that had taken refuge under his bed.  He pulled it out, tracing its wings with his finger.  Maybe if he thought about it differently?  Seven groups of five.  He pictured seven little airplanes, each carrying five tiny passengers.  He counted them on his fingers, five, ten, fifteen… thirty-five!\n\nA small smile crept onto Toby’s face.  He sat up in bed.  Maybe seven times five wasn’t so scary after all.  He looked down at Rusty.  “Rusty,” he whispered, “what’s seven times five?”\n\nRusty, awakened by the sound of his name, stretched, yawned, and thumped his tail against the floor. He didn’t answer, of course. But somehow, Toby knew he’d get there. Even if it took a little longer than his dream-dog counterpart.  He climbed out of bed, grabbed his multiplication chart, and a pencil.  He had a feeling that today, he might just soar.\n",
