While it might resemble a fan in its ability to oscillate and distribute air, the key difference is its **primary function**:\n\n* **Space Heater:** Designed to *heat* a room by generating warmth, often using electric coils, ceramic elements, or other heating methods.  This particular model appears to be an infrared heater.\n* **Fan:** Designed to *circulate* air to create a cooling breeze. It does not generate heat; it simply moves existing air around.\n\nTherefore, while both devices can involve moving air, a space heater's purpose is to warm a space, while a fan's purpose is to cool it.  This heater also includes a remote control for added convenience.",
