    "answer": "The exaggeration lies in the \"after coffee\" cat's wildly different expression.  Its eyes are comically wide, almost bulging, creating a sense of manic energy.  The open mouth and slight grimace/smile further amplify this, suggesting an almost deranged level of excitement.  This is a stark contrast to the \"before coffee\" cat, which appears grumpy and half-asleep with narrowed eyes.\n\nThe hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor by taking a relatable experience – the energizing effect of coffee – to an absurd extreme.  Most people feel more awake and alert after coffee, but the cat's exaggerated reaction implies a transformation into a state of near-lunacy.  This extreme difference between the two images, along with the implied anthropomorphism (attributing human-like coffee dependence to a cat), creates a humorous disconnect and makes the meme funny.  It plays on the common trope of coffee being a necessary crutch for functioning in the morning, making light of the sometimes desperate need for caffeine.\n",
