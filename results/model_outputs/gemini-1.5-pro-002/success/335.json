While it might not be an immediate, catastrophic hazard, it's definitely a safety concern.  The wearer is at increased risk of:\n\n* **Stubbed toes and foot injuries:** The exposed toe offers less protection against impact.\n* **Trips and falls:** The uneven wear could cause instability, especially on uneven surfaces.\n* **Moisture and debris entering the shoe:**  This can lead to discomfort and potential hygiene issues.\n\nIt's advisable to replace the shoe.  Continuing to wear it increases the risk of injury.\n",
