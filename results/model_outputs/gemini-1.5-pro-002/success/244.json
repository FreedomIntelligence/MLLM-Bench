    "answer": "Here's a comparison of the Marshall Major IV headphones (bottom left) and the JBL Tune 760NC (top right) headphones:\n\n| Feature | Marshall Major IV | JBL Tune 760NC |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Design** | Over-ear, on-ear design with a retro aesthetic.  | Over-ear, on-ear design with a modern, sleek look. |\n| **Material** | Leatherette and metal accents, giving a premium feel. | Primarily plastic construction, potentially feeling less premium. |\n| **Portability** | Foldable design for easier storage, but relatively bulky. | Foldable design for easier storage, generally lighter and more compact. |\n| **Functionality** | Wired and wireless (Bluetooth) connectivity. Known for their signature Marshall sound profile, often described as warm and bass-heavy.  | Wireless (Bluetooth) connectivity with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Likely a more balanced or bass-forward sound profile, typical of JBL. |\n| **Advantages** | Distinctive retro style.  Potentially more durable build quality due to metal components. Long battery life (advertised as 80+ hours). | Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) for blocking out ambient noise. Lighter and more compact for portability.  Potentially more affordable. |\n| **Disadvantages** | No ANC. Can be bulky for travel.  Sound profile may not suit all listeners (e.g., those preferring a neutral sound).  | Potentially less durable build quality.  Sound quality might not be as refined as the Marshall, especially in wired mode. |\n\n\nIt's important to note that this comparison is based on general observations and common brand characteristics.  Specific features and performance can vary between individual models and user experiences.  Reading detailed reviews before purchasing is always recommended.\n",
