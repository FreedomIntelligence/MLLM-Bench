Cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species (like the robin).  The robin, unknowingly, is raising the cuckoo chick as its own. This is detrimental to the robin, as the cuckoo chick often outcompetes the robin's own offspring for food and resources, sometimes even ejecting them from the nest.  The robin is being tricked into investing its parental care into a bird that isn't its own.\n",
