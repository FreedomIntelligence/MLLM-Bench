    "answer": "The humor in this meme comes from several elements:\n\n* **Juxtaposition and surprise:** The woman clearly expresses her dislike for dogs.  The next panel subverts this expectation by not only showing a dog in the car but having it positioned as if it's driving, taking up even more space than it would normally. This unexpected turn is the core of the joke.\n* **Absurdity:** The dog driving is inherently nonsensical. Its smug expression adds to the absurdity, as does the \"This is the way!\" caption, implying the dog's presence is not only normal but somehow correct or ordained.\n* **Character reactions:** The man's unchanged cheerful demeanor despite the woman's previous statement and the dog's sudden appearance heightens the absurdity. The woman's annoyed expression in the second panel contrasts with the man's and dog's, further emphasizing the unexpected and ridiculous situation.\n* **Referential humor (to a lesser extent):**  \"This is the way!\" is a popular internet phrase, often used ironically or to express approval of something unusual or unexpected. The NAFO/OFAN logo adds another layer of internet culture reference, likely resonating with those familiar with the online communities associated with it.  This adds to the in-group humor aspect.\n\nThe type of humor could be categorized as primarily **absurdist** due to the illogical nature of a dog driving, combined with elements of **situational irony** due to the contrast between the woman's dislike of dogs and the dog's prominent placement in the car. There's a touch of **satire** as well, gently mocking those who blindly follow trends or accept absurd situations without question (\"This is the way!\").\n",
