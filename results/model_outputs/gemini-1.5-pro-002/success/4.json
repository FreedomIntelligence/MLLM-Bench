    "answer": "The image shows an AV Access branded device, likely a docking station or hub, sitting on top of an iPad.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sockets on the AV Access device:\n\n* **Two USB-A Ports:** Standard USB ports for connecting peripherals like mice, keyboards, or flash drives. The symbol next to them indicates data transfer.\n* **One USB-C Port:**  A newer USB standard, likely for data transfer and potentially power delivery.  The symbol next to it also indicates data transfer.\n* **One HDMI Port:** For connecting to an external display like a monitor or TV. The symbol clearly depicts an HDMI connector.\n* **One 3.5mm Audio Jack:** A standard headphone/microphone jack.\n* **One SD Card Slot:** For reading and writing data to and from SD memory cards. The \"SD\" label confirms this.\n* **Power Button:**  Turns the device on and off. The standard power symbol identifies it.\n* **Two Indicator Lights:**  Their exact function isn't clear from the image, but they likely indicate power status and/or activity. One has a computer symbol and the other a circular symbol, possibly related to connectivity or a specific feature.\n\n\nThe iPad below serves as a surface in this image and isn't directly connected to the AV Access device.",
