However, audience engagement appears mixed.\n\n* **Engaged:** The woman in yellow and the man next to her seem to be paying attention to the presenter, although they are not looking directly at her.  The woman with long blonde hair is also likely engaged, as she has her laptop open and appears to be taking notes or following along with the presentation.\n\n* **Disengaged/Unclear:** The man with his back to the camera is focused on his laptop, making it difficult to determine his level of engagement with the presentation. He could be taking notes, but his body language suggests he might be working on something unrelated. The two individuals on the right, a woman with curly hair and a bearded man, appear to be more focused on their laptops than the presenter. The bearded man's body language, leaning away from the presentation, suggests disengagement. It is possible they are multitasking or distracted.\n\n\nOverall, while some audience members appear attentive, others show signs of disengagement, suggesting the presenter may need to find ways to recapture their attention.  The use of laptops makes it difficult to definitively judge engagement, as they could be used for note-taking or other presentation-related activities.\n",
