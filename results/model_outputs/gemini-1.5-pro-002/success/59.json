    "answer": "The building is the **Flatiron Building** in New York City.\n\nIt's special because of its distinctive triangular shape, designed to fit the unusual triangular plot of land formed by the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street.  When it was completed in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city and its unique shape quickly made it a New York icon.  It was also one of the earliest steel-skeleton skyscrapers.  Its official name is the Fuller Building, but the \"Flatiron\" nickname, derived from its resemblance to a clothes iron, became far more popular and stuck.\n",
