    "answer": "The interaction between the hummingbird and the canna flower is an example of **mutualism**, a type of symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit.\n\n* **Benefit to the hummingbird:** The hummingbird receives nectar from the flower, a rich source of energy.  This is their primary food source.\n\n* **Benefit to the flower:** As the hummingbird feeds, its head and beak come into contact with the flower's pollen-bearing anthers and stigma.  Pollen sticks to the bird, which then inadvertently carries it to other flowers of the same species, facilitating pollination.  Without pollinators like hummingbirds, the canna flower would struggle to reproduce.\n\nThere's no apparent harm to either party in this interaction.  The flower provides a readily available food source, and the hummingbird provides a crucial pollination service.  This co-evolutionary relationship has led to hummingbirds developing specialized beaks and hovering flight, and flowers developing bright colors and nectar-rich blossoms to attract these birds.\n",
