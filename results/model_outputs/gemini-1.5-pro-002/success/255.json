    "answer": "The illustration depicts four different big cats, each with distinct features:\n\n* **Tiger:**  Characterized by its vibrant orange fur with bold black vertical stripes.  Its body is long and muscular, built for stalking and ambushing prey.  The face has prominent white markings around the eyes and muzzle.\n\n* **Cougar (Puma):**  A uniformly tawny or light brown color, lacking any spots or stripes.  It has a relatively small head and a long, thick tail.  Its build is sleek and agile.\n\n* **Lion (male):**  The most recognizable feature is the thick, shaggy mane around the head and neck, a characteristic exclusive to male lions.  Its body is a uniform tawny brown, similar to the cougar but more robust.\n\n* **Lioness (with cubs):**  Like the cougar, the lioness lacks the male's mane and is a uniform tawny brown.  The presence of nursing cubs clearly distinguishes her from the cougar.  The cubs themselves exhibit faint spots, which typically fade as they mature.\n\n\nThe illustration effectively highlights the key visual differences that allow one to distinguish these big cat species.  The presence of stripes (tiger), a mane (male lion), or the absence of both (cougar, lioness) are immediate clues.  Size and build also contribute to identification, with the tiger appearing longer and leaner than the lion, and the cougar smaller than both.",
