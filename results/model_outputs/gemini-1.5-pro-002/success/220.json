    "answer": "The relationship between oxpeckers and warthogs is a classic example of mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship where both species benefit.  \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* **Benefit to the Oxpecker:** Oxpeckers primarily feed on ticks, flies, lice, and other parasites that infest the warthog's thick skin.  This provides them with a readily available food source. They also occasionally consume the warthog's earwax and blood from open wounds, though the extent to which this is beneficial or parasitic is debated.\n\n* **Benefit to the Warthog:** By having these parasites removed, warthogs experience relief from irritation and potential disease transmission.  Ticks, in particular, can carry numerous diseases harmful to mammals. The oxpeckers also act as an early warning system. Their hissing and flying off can alert the warthog to approaching predators.\n\nWhile traditionally viewed as purely mutualistic, recent research suggests the relationship may be more complex and sometimes parasitic. Some studies indicate that oxpeckers may intentionally keep wounds open to access blood, and that warthogs don't always show signs of enjoying the oxpeckers' attention.  However, the overall interaction likely leans towards mutualism in most cases, with both species generally benefiting from the association.\n",
