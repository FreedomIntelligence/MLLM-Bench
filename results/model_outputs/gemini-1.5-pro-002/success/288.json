Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Teenagers (13-19):**  Many individuals appear to be in their mid-to-late teens. This is suggested by their height, build, and facial features (lack of pronounced wrinkles or mature features).  Their clothing styles, including casual hoodies, jeans, and sneakers, also align with typical teenage attire.\n\n* **Young Adults (20s):** Some individuals might be in their early twenties.  While harder to pinpoint precisely from a still image, some faces appear slightly more mature.  Again, casual attire is prevalent, but some individuals display slightly more varied styles, hinting at a potential age difference.\n\n* **Older Adults (30+):** There are a few individuals who *could* be older adults, particularly some of those on the periphery of the march.  However, it's difficult to definitively categorize them based solely on the image.  Their presence is more speculative than the presence of teenagers and young adults.\n\nIt's important to note that age estimation from images is inherently imprecise.  These are educated guesses based on general visual cues and common associations of age with appearance and dress.\n",
