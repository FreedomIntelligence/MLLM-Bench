    "answer": "This fish appears to be a type of wrasse, possibly a **Green Birdmouth Wrasse** ( *Gomphosus caeruleus* ), although the image quality makes definitive identification challenging.  Here's a description based on the image:\n\n* **Body Shape:**  Fusiform, meaning it's elongated and somewhat torpedo-shaped, tapering towards both the head and tail.\n* **Coloration:** Predominantly green on the body. The head appears to have a bluish tinge, especially around the mouth area.  There's a hint of yellow on the pectoral fins.  The tail fin and the rear part of the dorsal and anal fins appear darker, possibly black or very dark blue.\n* **Head:**  Distinctive \"bird-like\" mouth, which is small and slightly pointed. This is a key feature of birdmouth wrasses.\n* **Fins:**  The pectoral fins seem relatively small and translucent with a yellowish tint. The dorsal fin runs along most of the back.  The caudal (tail) fin is likely rounded or truncate (straight across), but it's difficult to see clearly.\n* **Size:** It's hard to judge size from the picture without a reference, but birdmouth wrasses can reach up to about 12 inches (30 cm) in length.  This individual appears to be smaller, perhaps a juvenile or subadult.\n\nTo confirm the species, more details would be helpful, such as:\n\n* **Clearer view of the tail fin shape:** Is it rounded, forked, or truncate?\n* **Details of the dorsal and anal fins:** Are there any spots or markings?\n* **A view from the side:** This would help confirm the overall body shape and coloration.\n* **Location where the photo was taken:** Knowing the geographic region helps narrow down the possibilities.\n\nIf you can provide more information, a more precise identification might be possible.\n",
