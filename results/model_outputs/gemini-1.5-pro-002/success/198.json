Do not give aspirin to children.\n* **Comfortable environment:** Keep your environment cool and comfortable.\n* **Seek medical advice:** If the fever persists for more than a few days, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms like severe headache, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, or rash, consult a doctor.  Also, seek medical advice if you have any underlying health conditions.\n\n\nIt's important to note that I'm an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.
