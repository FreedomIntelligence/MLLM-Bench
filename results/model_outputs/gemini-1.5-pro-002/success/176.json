    "answer": "The oranges in the box appear to be roughly the same size as the plate of candies.  Since an average orange is about 3 inches in diameter, the plate is approximately **3 inches (7.6 cm)** in diameter.  It might be slightly larger, but using the orange as a visual guide, 3 inches is a good estimate.",
