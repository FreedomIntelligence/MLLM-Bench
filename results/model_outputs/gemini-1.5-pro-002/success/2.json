Their function is to tighten or loosen screws, particularly in situations requiring precision due to their small size.  The different colors might indicate different types of screwdriver heads (e.g., Phillips, slotted, Torx) or sizes.  The clear/amber-handled one marked \"Fuller Canada\" is likely a jeweler's screwdriver.\n",
