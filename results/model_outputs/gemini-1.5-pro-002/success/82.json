    "answer": "The thick, textured application of the paint strongly suggests **oil paint** or **acrylic paint** used with an **impasto** technique.  Impasto involves applying paint thickly enough that brushstrokes or palette knife marks are visible.  The raised texture is quite apparent in the image.  It's less likely to be watercolor, as watercolor typically creates a much thinner, more translucent wash of color.  While it's theoretically possible to achieve some texture with heavily applied watercolor, it wouldn't produce this degree of three-dimensionality.\n",
