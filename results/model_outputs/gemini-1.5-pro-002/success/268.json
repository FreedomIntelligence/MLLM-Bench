This suggests a component failure, likely of R46 itself, which overheated and potentially damaged surrounding components and the PCB.  This kind of damage is often caused by excessive current flow through the component, possibly due to a fault elsewhere in the circuit.  The board is likely unusable until the damaged components are replaced and the cause of the failure is identified and corrected.\n",
