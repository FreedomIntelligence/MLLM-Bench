    "answer": "The red berries in the smoothie bowl are raspberries. The dark purple berries are blackberries.\n\nRaspberries and blackberries are both aggregate fruits meaning they are made up of many small individual fruits clustered together. However, raspberries are hollow on the inside when picked, leaving a visible core, while blackberries retain a white, fleshy core.  Raspberries also tend to be smaller and more delicate than blackberries, and they have a slightly tarter flavor. Blackberries are larger, firmer, and have a sweeter, slightly earthier taste than raspberries.",
