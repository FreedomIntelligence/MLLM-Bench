    "answer": "The glass falling on the wooden floor is significantly more likely to break.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Hardness:** Wood is a much harder surface than the foam play mat.  When the glass hits the wood, the impact force is concentrated on a small area of the glass, leading to a higher pressure and a greater chance of shattering.\n* **Cushioning:** The foam mat is designed to absorb impact.  It will deform under the weight of the falling glass, spreading the force of the impact over a larger area and reducing the pressure on the glass. This cushioning effect significantly decreases the likelihood of breakage.\n\nEven though both glasses fall from the same height, the difference in surface properties makes a huge difference in the outcome.\n",
