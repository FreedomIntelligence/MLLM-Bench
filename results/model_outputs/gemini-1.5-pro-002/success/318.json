    "answer": "The equation of a circumference is given by (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.  The given points (1, -2) and (3, 2) are on the circumference, which means the segment connecting them is a chord.  The perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the center of the circle.  We'll use this fact to find the center.\n\n**1. Midpoint of the chord:**\n\nThe midpoint of the chord connecting (1, -2) and (3, 2) is:\n\n((1+3)/2, (-2+2)/2) = (2, 0)\n\n**2. Slope of the chord:**\n\nThe slope of the chord is:\n\n(2 - (-2)) / (3 - 1) = 4/2 = 2\n\n**3. Slope of the perpendicular bisector:**\n\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the chord's slope, which is -1/2.\n\n**4. Equation of the perpendicular bisector:**\n\nUsing the point-slope form with the midpoint (2, 0) and slope -1/2, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\ny - 0 = -1/2 (x - 2)\ny = -1/2x + 1\n\n**5.  Finding the center:**\n\nSince the diameter is also a chord, let's consider the diameter perpendicular to the given chord. Its slope will be the same as the perpendicular bisector we just found (-1/2). The equation of the line passing through (1, -2) with this slope is:\n\ny - (-2) = -1/2 (x - 1)\ny + 2 = -1/2x + 1/2\ny = -1/2x - 3/2\n\nThe intersection point of this line (diameter) and the perpendicular bisector is the center of the circle. We solve the system of equations:\n\ny = -1/2x + 1\ny = -1/2x - 3/2\n\nThis system has no solution, which means our assumption about the diameter being perpendicular to the given chord was incorrect. Instead, the given chord is a diameter.\n\n**6. Center and Radius:**\n\nSince the given chord is a diameter, its midpoint is the center of the circle: (2, 0).\n\nThe radius is half the length of the diameter:\n\nr = (1/2) * sqrt((3-1)² + (2-(-2))²) = (1/2) * sqrt(4 + 16) = (1/2) * sqrt(20) = sqrt(5)\n\n**7. Equation of the Circumference:**\n\nThe equation of the circumference is:\n\n(x - 2)² + (y - 0)² = (sqrt(5))²\n(x - 2)² + y² = 5\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(x-2)^2+y^2=5}$\n",
