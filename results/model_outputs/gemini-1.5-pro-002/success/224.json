    "answer": "The relationship between penguins and seals is primarily a predator-prey one.  Leopard seals, as depicted in the image, are a significant predator of penguins.  They hunt penguins in the water, often waiting near the shore where penguins enter and exit the ocean.  While other seals might occasionally eat penguins, leopard seals are the most specialized in hunting them.\n\nThe image clearly shows this dynamic.  The leopard seal's open mouth and sharp teeth demonstrate its predatory nature, while the penguin's posture suggests it is attempting to escape.  They share a habitat in the Southern Ocean, but this shared space leads to a deadly game of survival.  \n\nWhile not directly a symbiotic relationship, the predator-prey interaction between seals (especially leopard seals) and penguins plays a crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem, regulating populations and influencing the evolutionary adaptations of both species.\n",
