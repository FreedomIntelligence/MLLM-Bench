    "answer": "**Woman 1 (in white vest, reaching for food):** Mmm, this potato salad is amazing, Lerato! You really outdid yourself.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato, in white top with braided hair):** Thanks, babe! It’s my grandma’s recipe. You know, the one I told you about?  She’d be so happy we’re all enjoying it.\n\n**Woman 3 (in white furry vest, sipping drink):**  Definitely a winner. So, how’s the wedding planning coming along, Lerato? Any bridezilla moments yet?\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato):**  Girl, don't even start!  Trying to find the right flowers is proving to be mission impossible. I swear, I've seen more shades of pink than I knew existed.\n\n**Woman 4 (with curly hair, back to camera):**  You'll find the perfect ones. Just breathe.  And remember, the most important thing is that you’re marrying the man of your dreams.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato):**  So true.  Speaking of which, he’s taking his groomsmen for a “golf weekend” next weekend.  Can you believe it?  A “golf weekend.”  More like a boys-gone-wild weekend, I’m sure.\n\n**Woman 3 (in white furry vest):**  Don’t worry about it.  We'll have our own girls-gone-mild weekend right here! Spa day, anyone?\n\n**Woman 1 (in white vest):**  I’m in!  We can even try to recreate this amazing spread. Though I doubt I can match Lerato’s potato salad skills.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato, laughing):**  Don’t worry, I’ll share the secret.  It's all about the love, you know?\n\n**Woman 4 (with curly hair):**  And the paprika.  Don't forget the paprika!\n\n**(All women laugh, the sound blending with the gentle breeze rustling through the banana leaves.)**\n",
