    "answer": "The exercise is the **barbell bench press**.\n\n**Technical essentials:**\n\n* **Lie flat on the bench:** Your back should be slightly arched, feet flat on the floor (or tucked under the bench for a more advanced variation).  Head, shoulders, and glutes should maintain contact with the bench throughout the movement.\n* **Grip:**  Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n* **Unrack the bar:** Lift the bar off the rack with assistance if necessary, ensuring it's directly above your chest.\n* **Lower the bar:** Slowly lower the bar to your chest, keeping your elbows slightly tucked in (around a 45-degree angle).\n* **Press the bar:** Push the bar back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully but avoiding locking your elbows.\n* **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower the bar, and exhale as you press it back up.\n* **Control:** Maintain control of the weight throughout the entire movement. Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest.\n\nThe bench press is a compound exercise primarily targeting the pectoralis major (chest muscles), as well as the anterior deltoids (front shoulders) and triceps brachii.  Proper form is crucial to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.\n",
