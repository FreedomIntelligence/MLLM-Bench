    "answer": "The white car appears to be turning left while the darker car is moving straight ahead at a higher speed.  Given their current trajectories and speeds, a collision is possible in the next few seconds.\n\nTo avoid a collision, the drivers could take the following actions:\n\n* **Darker car (likely the primary risk):** The driver of the darker car needs to brake immediately and potentially steer slightly to the right to increase the distance from the white car.  Given the snowy conditions, braking hard could lead to a loss of control, so careful modulation of the brakes is essential.\n* **White car:** The driver of the white car should also be cautious. While they appear to be turning, they should ensure they aren't cutting off the darker car.  They could potentially slow down their turn slightly to give the darker car more time to react.\n\n**Crucially, both drivers need to be aware of the hazardous conditions (snow and darkness) and adjust their driving accordingly.**  Reduced visibility and slippery roads necessitate slower speeds and increased following distances.  Overconfidence in these conditions is a major contributing factor to accidents.\n",
