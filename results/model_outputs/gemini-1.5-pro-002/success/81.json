    "answer": "Several cooking methods are likely used to create the dishes shown:\n\n* **Deep Frying:** The items on skewers (both chicken and what appears to be a breaded/battered sausage or vegetable) are almost certainly deep-fried, giving them their golden-brown color and crispy texture.  The flat, layered bread seen to the left might also be deep-fried, as it resembles a puri.\n\n* **Pan-frying or Griddling:** The filling inside the rolls/sandwiches (especially the ones with a reddish sauce) could be pan-fried or cooked on a griddle. This is common for fillings like spiced chicken or vegetables. The flatbread being cooked in the background is definitely being cooked on a flat griddle.\n\n* **Steaming/Boiling (potentially):**  The buns/rolls themselves are likely steamed or boiled before being filled. This is a common preparation method for this type of bread in South Asian cuisine. The filling in some of the sandwiches appears to be a dark greenish color, possibly a vegetable filling that could have been boiled or steamed prior to being placed in the bread.\n\n* **Assembling/Marinating:** While not strictly a cooking method, the act of assembling the sandwiches and likely marinating the skewered items before frying adds flavor and completes the dish.  The reddish sauce in some of the sandwiches suggests a marinade or spice blend was used.\n",
