    "answer": "The data suggests a positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **US (High GDP per capita):**  The US has a high average night light value per pixel (4.66).  A significant portion of the country (almost 80%) falls within higher night light intensity ranges (3-62).  This aligns with a developed economy with widespread electricity access and economic activity.\n\n* **Brazil (Medium GDP per capita):** Brazil shows a lower average night light value (0.63) compared to the US.  A large portion of the country has very low or no night light intensity (94.02% at 0).  While Brazil has some areas with higher intensities, they are less prevalent than in the US, reflecting its lower, but still developing, economic status.\n\n* **Madagascar (Low GDP per capita):** Madagascar has the lowest average night light value (0.02) and an overwhelming majority (99.73%) of the country falls into the zero intensity category. This is consistent with a less developed economy with limited electricity access and lower economic output.\n\n**In summary:** Higher GDP per capita correlates with higher average night light intensity and a greater proportion of the country exhibiting higher light intensity values.  Conversely, lower GDP per capita corresponds with lower average night light intensity and a larger percentage of the country having little to no detectable night light.  This relationship likely reflects the connection between economic activity, electricity consumption, and development.\n",
