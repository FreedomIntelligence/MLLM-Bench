    "answer": "Let's analyze each equation:\n\n1. **a³ ÷ a⁵ = a³⁻⁵ = a⁻² = 1/a² (a≠0):**  This is **correct**.  The rule for dividing exponents with the same base is to subtract the exponents.\n\n2. **(0.0001)⁰ = (100000)⁰:** This is **incorrect**. Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, both sides of the equation should equal 1, not each other.  0.0001 does not equal 100000.\n\n3. **m³ ÷ m³ = m³⁻³ = m⁰ = 1:** This is **correct**.  As explained above, any non-zero number (in this case, m) raised to the power of zero equals 1.\n\n4. **8x¹⁰ ÷ 2x² = 6x⁸:** This is **incorrect**. When dividing terms with coefficients and variables, you divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of like variables.  The correct simplification is (8/2)x^(10-2) = 4x⁸.\n\n5. **(xⁿ)² = xⁿ = x²:** This is **incorrect**. The rule for raising a power to a power is to multiply the exponents.  The correct simplification is x^(n*2) = x²ⁿ.\n\nTherefore, only **two** of the five equations (1 and 3) are correct.",
