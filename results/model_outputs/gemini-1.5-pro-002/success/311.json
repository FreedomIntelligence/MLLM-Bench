    "answer": "Here's the solution:\n\n1. **Circle (O) = 6:**  From the first two equations, we can solve for the circle and triangle. If O + Δ = 8 and O - Δ = 4, then O = 6 and Δ = 2.\n\n2. **Triangle (Δ) = 2:** (Solved above)\n\n3. **Square (□) = 3:** Since a star minus a square equals a square, and two squares equal a star, the star must be made up of two squares.  Knowing that a star plus a square equals 12, and the star is made of two squares, then three squares equal 12.  Therefore, a square equals 3 and a star equals 6.\n\n4. **Star (☆) = 6:** (Solved above)\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n* ☆ = 6\n* O = 6\n* □ = 3\n* Δ = 2",
