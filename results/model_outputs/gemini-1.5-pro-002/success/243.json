    "answer": "Godzilla and Kong exhibit stark contrasts in their visual design.\n\n* **Texture:** Godzilla's skin resembles reptilian scales, thick and rough, like hardened rock or bark.  His dorsal fins are jagged and pointed. Kong's fur is thick and matted, giving him a more mammalian, almost shaggy appearance.  His skin, where visible, appears leathery and tough.\n\n* **Coloration:** Godzilla is predominantly dark greenish-brown, with hints of gold or bronze in his scales. This earthy palette helps him blend with natural environments. Kong is a much darker brown, almost black in some areas, which contrasts with the lighter fur on his chest and face.\n\n* **Body Structure:** Godzilla's build is reptilian, with a thick, powerful tail, a robust torso, and strong, digitigrade legs. His dorsal fins run down his back to the tip of his tail. Kong has a more primate-like structure, with long arms built for climbing and knuckle-walking, a broad chest, and powerful legs. His posture is more upright than Godzilla's.  While both are massive, Godzilla appears more elongated and horizontal, while Kong is more compact and vertical.\n",
