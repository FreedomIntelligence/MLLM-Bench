To make these, you'll need:\n\n* **Sushi Rice:** Short-grain Japanese rice, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.\n* **Nori:** Dried seaweed sheets.\n* **Fillings:** Based on the image, you'll need:\n    * **Tuna:**  Likely raw, sushi-grade tuna.\n    * **Imitation Crab (Surimi) and Avocado:** A common combination.\n    * **Cucumber:** Thinly sliced.\n    * **Pickled Yellow Radish (Takuan):**  This provides a sweet and tangy flavor.\n* **Optional Garnishes:**\n    * **Gari (Pickled Ginger):**  Seen in the corner of the dish.\n    * **Wasabi:**  Japanese horseradish (not pictured, but often served with sushi).\n    * **Soy Sauce:** For dipping (not pictured).\n    * **Green Decorative Grass:**  Purely for presentation.\n\n\n**Equipment:**\n\n* **Bamboo rolling mat (Makisu):** Essential for rolling the sushi.\n* **Sharp knife:**  For clean cuts.\n* **Rice cooker (optional but recommended):** Makes perfect sushi rice.\n\n\nIf you're a beginner, it's a good idea to start with just one or two fillings. Cucumber and avocado are good choices for beginners as they are easy to work with.  Make sure to buy sushi-grade fish if you plan to use raw fish.  Enjoy!\n",
