In the background, two individuals are pointing and seemingly talking about her, which strongly implies they are the source of her discomfort.  This visual narrative suggests she is being targeted due to her religious attire, indicating potential religious discrimination.  It's important to note that this is an interpretation based on the limited information provided by a single image.  We don't know the exact context or what is being said, but the composition strongly suggests discriminatory behavior.\n",
