    "answer": "To determine which piece to place in the second row and first column, we need to analyze the puzzle.\n\n1. The first equation shows that two apples equal 2, meaning each apple is worth 1.\n2. The second equation states that one apple and a missing piece equal 4. Since we know one apple is worth 1, the missing piece must be worth 3.\n3. The third equation shows that the sum of the missing piece and a banana equals 7. If the missing piece is worth 3, then the banana must be worth 4 (7 - 3 = 4).\n\nGiven the pieces left, the one that fits the criteria of being worth 3 should be placed in the second row and first column. Based on the context, it seems that the strawberry piece is the correct choice.",
