Here’s a breakdown of their potential functions:\n\n1. **Screwdrivers**: The primary objects in the image are various types of screwdrivers, identifiable by their colored handles and different shapes of the tips. They are designed for turning screws and can vary in type, including:\n   - **Flathead Screwdrivers**: Have a flat, straight tip for slotted screws.\n   - **Phillips Screwdrivers**: Feature a cross-shaped tip for Phillips screws.\n   - **Torx Screwdrivers**: Have a star-shaped tip for Torx screws.\n   - **Hex Key (Allen Wrench)**: Used for hexagonal socket screws.\n\n2. **Color-Coding**: The different colors of the handles may indicate various sizes or types, making it easier for users to select the appropriate tool quickly.\n\nOverall, these tools are essential for assembling, disassembling, or repairing various objects, from electronics to furniture.",
