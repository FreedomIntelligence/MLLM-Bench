    "answer": "The teacher is likely to make several immediate corrections to the student's technique. They might focus on:\n\n1. **Bow Hold**: Ensuring the student has a relaxed and proper grip on the bow, emphasizing finger placement and wrist flexibility.\n2. **Posture**: Correcting the student's posture to ensure they are standing or sitting up straight, which can improve sound production.\n3. **Left Hand Position**: Adjusting the positioning of the left hand on the fingerboard to ensure accurate finger placement and intonation.\n\nAfter these corrections, the teacher might transition the student to practice simple scales, such as the D major scale, focusing on smooth bow strokes and even tone production. They may also introduce basic finger exercises to reinforce proper left-hand technique.",
