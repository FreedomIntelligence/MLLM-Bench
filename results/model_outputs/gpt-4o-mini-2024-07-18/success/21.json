    "answer": "The exercise depicted in the image is the **bench press**. \n\n### Technical Essentials of the Bench Press:\n\n1. **Setup**: Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Lower the barbell to your chest, ensuring your elbows are at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.\n\n3. **Execution**: Press the barbell upward until your arms are fully extended. Engage your core throughout the movement to maintain stability.\n\n4. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the barbell and exhale as you press it back up.\n\n5. **Safety**: Use a spotter or safety bars if lifting heavy weights to prevent injury. Always ensure the weights are securely fastened.\n\nThis exercise primarily targets the pectoral muscles, shoulders, and triceps, making it a fundamental movement for upper body strength training.",
