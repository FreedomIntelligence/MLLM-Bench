Here are some possible causes for this:\n\n1. **Water Disturbance**: Movement in the water can create turbulence, leading to a blurred image.\n  \n2. **Depth and Light**: The image may have been taken at a depth where light penetration is limited, resulting in a loss of clarity and color.\n\n3. **Camera Focus**: If the camera was not properly focused on the subject, it could result in a blurry image.\n\n4. **Motion Blur**: If the camera or the subject was moving during the shot, this could also contribute to blurriness.\n\n5. **Lens Quality**: The quality of the camera lens can affect image sharpness, especially in challenging conditions like underwater photography.\n\nImproving lighting conditions, stabilizing the camera, and ensuring proper focus can help enhance image quality in similar situations.",
