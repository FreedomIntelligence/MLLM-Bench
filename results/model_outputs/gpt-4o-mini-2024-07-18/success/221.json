    "answer": "The interaction between the shark and the smaller fish swimming near it is an example of a symbiotic relationship, specifically commensalism. In this scenario, the smaller fish, often referred to as cleaner fish, benefit from the presence of the shark without causing harm to it.\n\n### Why the Small Fish Are Not Attacked:\n\n1. **Mutual Benefit**: The smaller fish help keep the shark clean by eating parasites and dead skin off its body. This provides a food source for the smaller fish while benefiting the shark by promoting its health.\n\n2. **Behavioral Adaptations**: The smaller fish have evolved behaviors that help them avoid being seen as prey. They often swim in a way that keeps them close to the shark but out of reach of its jaws.\n\n3. **Size and Speed**: The smaller fish are generally agile and can quickly dart away if they sense danger, reducing the likelihood of being attacked.\n\n### Categorization of the Relationship:\n\nThis interaction can be categorized as **commensalism**, where one species (the smaller fish) benefits while the other species (the shark) is neither helped nor harmed. This type of relationship is common in marine ecosystems and highlights the complex interdependencies that exist in nature.",
