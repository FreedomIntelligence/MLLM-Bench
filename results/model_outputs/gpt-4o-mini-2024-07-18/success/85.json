Here are some attributes that may help with recognition:\n\n- **Color**: The leaves have a striking combination of bright yellow edges with dark green centers. There are also lighter green streaks within the darker areas.\n  \n- **Shape**: The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a wavy or ruffled edge. They tend to grow in a rosette formation.\n\n- **Size**: The leaves can be quite large, often broad enough to create a lush appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The surface of the leaves appears smooth with prominent veins, adding to their visual appeal.\n\n- **Growth Habit**: This plant typically grows in clumps, making it suitable for borders or as ground cover.\n\nThese characteristics can help in identifying this particular type of hosta in gardens or landscapes.",
