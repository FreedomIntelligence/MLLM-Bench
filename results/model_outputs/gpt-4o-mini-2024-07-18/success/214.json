    "answer": "The scatter plot indicates a negative relationship between vaccination rates and excess deaths. As the vaccination rate increases, the number of excess deaths tends to decrease. This is supported by the correlation coefficient of -0.47, which suggests a moderate inverse relationship, and the negative slope of the regression line (-0.59), indicating that for each percentage point increase in vaccination rate, excess deaths decrease by approximately 0.59.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can use the regression line. \n\nAssuming a linear model based on the general trend, we can estimate:\n\n1. Identify the vaccination rate of 85% on the x-axis.\n2. Find the corresponding y-value (excess deaths) on the regression line.\n\nFrom the plot, it appears that the excess deaths for a vaccination rate of 85% would be around 30 to 35 excess deaths. \n\nThus, we can predict that a state with an 85% vaccination rate would likely have approximately **30 to 35 excess deaths**.",
