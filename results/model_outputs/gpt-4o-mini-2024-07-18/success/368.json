We need more days like this, away from all the craziness.\"\n\n**Character 1 (Sophie):** \"Agreed! We should make it a monthly thing. Just us, good food, and no distractions.\"\n\n**Character 2 (Lila):** \"And maybe some games? I’m still waiting for my rematch in that card game!\"\n\n**Character 3 (Maya):** *smirking* \"You mean the game where you lost spectacularly? I think we all remember that!\"\n\n**Character 4 (Jade):** *laughing* \"Let her have her moment, Maya! Besides, it’s about having fun, not just winning.\"\n\n**Character 1 (Sophie):** \"Exactly!
