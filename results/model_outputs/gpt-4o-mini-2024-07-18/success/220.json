    "answer": "The relationship between oxpeckers and warthogs is a classic example of mutualism, where both species benefit from their interaction.\n\n### Benefits to the Warthog:\n1. **Parasite Removal**: Oxpeckers feed on ticks, fleas, and other parasites that infest the warthog's skin. By removing these pests, the birds help improve the warthog's health and comfort.\n2. **Increased Vigilance**: The presence of oxpeckers can alert warthogs to potential threats. The birds are often more aware of their surroundings, and their calls can serve as a warning system for the warthogs.\n\n### Benefits to the Oxpecker:\n1. **Food Source**: The primary benefit for oxpeckers is access to a steady food supply. They rely on the parasites they find on warthogs for nutrition.\n2. **Safe Perching**: Warthogs provide a safe place for oxpeckers to rest and perch, reducing their vulnerability to predators while they feed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis symbiotic relationship showcases how different species can interact in ways that enhance their survival and well-being. The warthog gains relief from parasites, while the oxpecker secures food and safety, highlighting the interconnectedness of ecosystems.",
