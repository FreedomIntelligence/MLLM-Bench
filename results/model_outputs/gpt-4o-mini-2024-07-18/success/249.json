    "answer": "When comparing Earth and Mars based on their atmospheric conditions and surface features, several key differences and similarities emerge:\n\n### Atmospheric Conditions:\n\n**Earth:**\n- **Composition:** Primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases.\n- **Pressure:** Average atmospheric pressure is about 101.3 kPa at sea level.\n- **Temperature:** Average surface temperature is around 15°C (59°F), with a range influenced by weather systems.\n- **Weather:** Dynamic weather patterns, including rain, storms, and varying climates due to its water-rich atmosphere.\n\n**Mars:**\n- **Composition:** Mostly carbon dioxide (95.3%), with nitrogen and argon making up most of the remainder.\n- **Pressure:** Much lower atmospheric pressure, about 0.6 kPa, which is less than 1% of Earth's.\n- **Temperature:** Average surface temperature is about -63°C (-81°F), with significant variations between day and night.\n- **Weather:** Thin atmosphere leads to less dynamic weather; dust storms can occur but are less varied than Earth's weather systems.\n\n### Surface Features:\n\n**Earth:**\n- **Water:** Approximately 71% of the surface is covered by water, with oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n- **Landforms:** Diverse landscapes including mountains, forests, deserts, and plains, shaped by tectonic activity and erosion.\n- **Biodiversity:** Rich ecosystems support a wide variety of life forms.\n\n**Mars:**\n- **Water:** Evidence of past water flows; currently, water exists mainly as ice at the poles and possibly as brines.\n- **Landforms:** Features include the largest volcano (Olympus Mons), the deepest canyon (Valles Marineris), and vast plains of dust and sand.\n- **Biodiversity:** No known life forms; surface conditions are harsh and inhospitable.\n\n### Summary:\nEarth's atmosphere supports a diverse range of life and dynamic weather, while Mars has a thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere with extreme temperatures and limited weather phenomena. Surface features on Earth include abundant water and varied landscapes, whereas Mars features dry, rocky terrain with evidence of past water activity.",
