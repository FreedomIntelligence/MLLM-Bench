    "answer": "The visual metaphor in the right image dramatically exaggerates the challenge of caring for a baby by depicting the situation as if the caregiver is handling a bomb instead of a sleeping child. This hyperbole highlights the intense pressure and anxiety that can accompany parenting, especially for new parents who may feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe humor arises from the absurdity of comparing a peaceful moment, like putting a baby to sleep, to a high-stakes scenario involving explosives. This juxtaposition creates a comedic effect, as it transforms an everyday task into a life-or-death situation, amplifying the stress in a playful way. The exaggerated imagery allows viewers to relate to the feelings of anxiety while also finding amusement in the exaggerated comparison.",
