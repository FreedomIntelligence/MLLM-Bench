A CT scan of the brain was ordered to evaluate for possible intracranial pathology.\n\n**Technique:**\nNon-contrast CT scan of the brain was performed in axial sections.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. **Lesion Identification:**\n   - A well-defined, hyperdense mass is noted in the [specific location, e.g., right frontal lobe]. The lesion measures approximately [size] cm in diameter.\n   - Surrounding edema is present, with a significant hypodense area indicating associated edema.\n\n2. **Midline Shift:**\n   - There is a mild midline shift of the brain structures towards the [left/right] side, suggesting increased intracranial pressure.\n\n3. **Ventricular System:**\n   - The ventricular system appears [normal/dilated/compressed], with no evidence of hydrocephalus.\n\n4. **Cerebral Sulci:**\n   - The cerebral sulci are [normal/effaced], indicating possible mass effect from the lesion.\n\n5. **Other Findings:**\n   - No acute hemorrhage is identified.\n   - No other focal lesions or significant calcifications are observed.\n\n**Impression:**\n- The findings are suggestive of a [possible diagnosis, e.g., glioma, meningioma, metastasis].
