    "answer": "Once upon a time in a cozy little room, a boy named Max lay in bed, his mind swirling with thoughts of school. The moonlight streamed through his window, illuminating his colorful room filled with toys and books. Max had a big math test the next day, and the numbers danced in his head like playful fireflies.\n\nAs he stared at the ceiling, he began to worry about the multiplication tables. “What if I forget?” he murmured to himself. Suddenly, his loyal dog, Bingo, trotted over, sensing Max’s unease. With a gentle nudge, Bingo encouraged him to relax.\n\nMax closed his eyes and imagined a classroom where Bingo was the teacher. In this dream, Bingo wore a tiny pair of glasses and stood at the front of the class, confidently writing on the chalkboard. “7 times 5 equals 35!” he barked, wagging his tail proudly. The other kids giggled and cheered, and Max felt a wave of relief wash over him.\n\nIn the dream, Max raised his hand, excited to answer questions. With Bingo’s encouragement, he solved problems and helped his classmates. “Math can be fun!” he exclaimed, and the room erupted in applause.\n\nAs the dream continued, Max felt a sense of confidence growing inside him. He realized that with practice and a little help from his furry friend, he could tackle anything that came his way.\n\nWhen Max woke up the next morning, he felt ready for the test. With Bingo by his side, he knew he could face whatever challenges lay ahead. Together, they dashed off to school, ready to conquer the day, one multiplication problem at a time.",
