If it has just been shot and is still moving upward, it will continue to rise for a brief moment before gravity pulls it back down. If it has already reached its peak height, it will begin to fall. \n\nWithout knowing the exact speed and angle of the shot, it's difficult to predict definitively, but generally, it will either rise slightly more or start to fall in the next second.",
