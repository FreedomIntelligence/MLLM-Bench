The thick, impasto technique suggests a medium that allows for dimensionality, which is characteristic of both acrylics and oils. \n\n**Acrylic paint** is known for its quick drying time and versatility, making it a popular choice for textured work. **Oil paint**, on the other hand, would provide a rich depth of color and a longer working time, allowing for blending and layering.\n\nThe vibrant colors and detailed floral designs also indicate that the artist likely used a medium that allows for both fine detail and bold application.",
