    "answer": "**Winter's Whisper**\n\nIn the hush of falling snow,  \nWhere shadows blend and softly flow,  \nA world wrapped tight in white embrace,  \nEach step a dance, a measured pace.  \n\nThe streets, they wear a muffled shroud,  \nAs whispers of the wind grow loud,  \nYet in this monochrome expanse,  \nLife's quiet pulse begins to dance.  \n\nBeneath the weight of winter's hand,  \nResilience blooms in frozen land,  \nFor every flake that drifts and sways,  \nA promise waits for brighter days.  \n\nThe trees stand tall in silent grace,  \nTheir branches draped in nature's lace,  \nWhile footprints trace a fleeting line,  \nA testament to hearts that shine.  \n\nSo let the snow fall soft and deep,  \nIn solitude, the soul can leap,  \nFor in the stillness, strength is found,  \nA symphony in silence, profound.  \n\nAs winter wraps the world in white,  \nRemember, life ignites the night,  \nIn every flurry, every chill,  \nA spark of warmth, a steadfast will.
