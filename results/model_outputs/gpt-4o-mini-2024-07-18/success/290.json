    "answer": "To restore your bike to working condition, here are the components and steps you'll need to consider:\n\n### Components Needed:\n\n1. **Wheels**:\n   - Check the rims for damage. You may need new wheels or to replace the tires and tubes.\n\n2. **Brakes**:\n   - Inspect the brake system (calipers, levers, and cables). You might need to replace brake pads and cables.\n\n3. **Drivetrain**:\n   - **Chain**: Inspect for rust or wear. A new chain may be necessary.\n   - **Crankset**: Ensure the chainrings are in good condition. Replace if worn.\n   - **Pedals**: Check for functionality and replace if damaged.\n\n4. **Handlebars**:\n   - Ensure they are straight and secure. You may need new grips or bar ends.\n\n5. **Seat**:\n   - Check the saddle for comfort and damage. Replace if necessary.\n\n6. **Headset**:\n   - Inspect for smooth steering. You may need to clean or replace bearings.\n\n7. **Bottom Bracket**:\n   - Ensure it turns smoothly. Replace if it feels gritty or loose.\n\n8. **Cables and Housing**:\n   - Replace any frayed cables and worn housing for smooth shifting and braking.\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n1. **Cleaning**: Thoroughly clean the frame and components to remove rust and dirt.\n\n2. **Lubrication**: Lubricate the chain, moving parts, and bearings.\n\n3. **Tuning**: After assembling, tune the brakes and gears to ensure proper function.\n\n4. **Safety Check**: Before riding, do a safety check to ensure all components are secure and functioning.\n\n5. **Test Ride**: Start with a short ride to test stability and comfort.\n\n### Tools Required:\n\n- Allen wrenches\n- Screwdrivers\n- Chain tool\n- Tire levers\n- Pump\n\nBy following these steps and replacing the necessary components, you should be able to restore your bike to a safe and functional condition.",
