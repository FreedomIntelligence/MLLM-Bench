The tight-lipped expression further emphasizes a strong emotional response.\n\n2. **Color**: The character's bright red color is often associated with intense emotions such as anger. \n\n3. **Body Language**: The character's stance, with arms at the sides and a rigid posture, suggests a readiness to react, reinforcing the sense of heightened emotion.\n\nOverall, these visual cues combine to convey a strong, intense feeling of anger.",
