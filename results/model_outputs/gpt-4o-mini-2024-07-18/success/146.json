    "answer": "The meme contrasts two exaggerated expressions of a cat to humorously illustrate the effects of coffee. \n\n1. **Before Coffee**: The cat appears grumpy and lethargic, with narrowed eyes and a flat mouth, conveying a sense of annoyance or fatigue. This expression is hyperbolic, as it amplifies the common feeling of being tired or unmotivated before caffeine kicks in.\n\n2. **After Coffee**: In stark contrast, the cat's expression is wildly enthusiastic, with wide eyes and a big, open-mouthed grin. This hyperbole captures the sudden surge of energy and excitement many people feel after consuming coffee.\n\nThe humor arises from this exaggerated transformation, relatable to anyone who has experienced the drastic change in mood and energy levels associated with coffee consumption. The stark visual difference between the two states highlights the comedic effect, making it a playful commentary on daily routines and caffeine dependency.",
