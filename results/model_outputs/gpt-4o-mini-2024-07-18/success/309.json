    "answer": "Yes, if the container in the top left corner is filled with boiling water at 100째C, it is likely that someone holding it could be scalded. Most containers are not designed to insulate against such high temperatures, so the exterior could become very hot to the touch, posing a burn risk. It's important to use insulated containers designed for hot liquids to prevent such accidents.",
