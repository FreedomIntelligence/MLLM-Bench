Service dogs are trained to assist individuals with disabilities, and many laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S., allow service animals to accompany their handlers in public spaces. Denying entry to a person with a service dog could be seen as a violation of their rights and an instance of discrimination.",
