This iconic statue was a gift from France to the United States, dedicated on October 28, 1886, to commemorate the centennial of American independence.\n\nHistorically, the Statue of Liberty symbolizes freedom and democracy. It was intended to celebrate the enduring friendship between the two nations and to highlight the values of liberty and enlightenment. The statue is a representation of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who holds a torch above her head, lighting the way to freedom and opportunity.\n\nSocially, the Statue of Liberty has become a universal symbol of hope for immigrants arriving in the United States. As they passed through Ellis Island, many would have seen the statue as a welcoming figure, representing the promise of a new life and the ideals of equality and opportunity. Over the years, it has also served as a powerful emblem in various movements advocating for civil rights and social justice, reinforcing its status as a beacon of hope and inspiration for people around the world.",
