This reinforces outdated stereotypes that women are less capable than men in practical matters. \n\nBy framing the message in a way that implies disbelief at a woman’s competence, the ad perpetuates a narrative that women are weaker or less skilled, which can have a detrimental impact on societal perceptions. Such portrayals can contribute to the normalization of gender stereotypes, discouraging women from pursuing roles or tasks traditionally viewed as male-dominated.\n\nAdditionally, this kind of messaging can affect women's self-perception and confidence, leading them to internalize these stereotypes. Overall, the ad reflects and perpetuates a narrow view of gender roles, which can hinder progress toward gender equality and reinforce harmful biases in both personal and professional contexts.",
