This texture often indicates freshness and juiciness.\n\nIn contrast, the orange fruit features a dimpled, rough texture with a pebbly surface. This texture is characteristic of citrus fruits and contributes to its thicker skin, which helps protect the fruit inside.\n\nOverall, while one fruit has a sleek and smooth appearance, the other is more textured and rugged, highlighting their distinct characteristics.",
