    "criteria": "1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",

    "answer": "The chart shows the global mean temperature compared to the average from 1850-1900, indicating a significant upward trend over time. Key implications include:\n\n1. **Rising Temperatures**: There is a clear increase in global temperatures since the late 19th century, with a marked acceleration in recent decades.\n\n2. **Variability**: While there are fluctuations year-to-year, the overall trend is upward, suggesting long-term climate change.\n\n3. **Data Consistency**: Multiple datasets (HadCRUT5, NOAA, GISTEMP, etc.) show similar trends, reinforcing the reliability of the findings.\n\n4. **Climate Change Awareness**: The data underscores the urgency of addressing climate change, as rising temperatures can lead to severe environmental impacts.\n\nOverall, the chart illustrates the reality of global warming and its potential implications for the planet.",
