    "answer": "Upon the crest where silence reigns,  \nA solitary hiker, free from chains,  \nAwaits the dawn with bated breath,  \nAs night retreats, embracing death.  \n\nThe mountains stir in soft embrace,  \nBathed in hues of gold and grace,  \nA canvas stretched, the sky ignites,  \nWith whispers of the coming lights.  \n\nThe sun, a fiery orb on high,  \nPaints shadows long, then bids goodbye  \nTo stars that fade in morning's glow,  \nAs nature wakes from slumber slow.  \n\nEach beam that dances on the stone,  \nReveals the beauty, all alone,  \nThe rustling leaves, the distant streams,  \nAwash in warmth, like waking dreams.  \n\nThe hiker stands, a silhouette,  \nIn harmony with the sun's duet,  \nA moment held, a breath, a sigh,  \nAs day unfolds, the world awry.  \n\nWith every step, the path unwinds,  \nThrough valleys deep and mountains blind,  \nIn dawn's embrace, the spirit soars,  \nA journey born on nature's shores.  \n\nSo let the sunrise guide the way,  \nFor in its light, the heart will stay,  \nIn solitude, a bond we find,  \nWith mountain peaks and the dawn’s kind.
