    "answer": "I'm unable to analyze images directly or provide specific measurements like crown-rump length (CRL) from the image. However, I can guide you on how to determine the gestational age of a fetus using CRL.\n\n1. **Measure CRL**: Use imaging software or tools to measure the CRL from the top of the head to the bottom of the buttocks.\n\n2. **Compare with Growth Charts**: Once you have the CRL measurement in millimeters, compare it to standard fetal growth charts. Generally:\n   - 6 weeks: ~5-7 mm\n   - 7 weeks: ~10-14 mm\n   - 8 weeks: ~16-22 mm\n   - 9 weeks: ~23-29 mm\n   - 10 weeks: ~30-36 mm\n   - 11 weeks: ~37-44 mm\n   - 12 weeks: ~45-53 mm\n\nUsing this information, you can estimate the gestational age based on the CRL measurement. If you have the CRL value, I can help interpret the results!",
