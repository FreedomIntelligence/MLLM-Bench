    "answer": "The red berry in the smoothie bowl is likely a raspberry, while the dark purple berry is likely a blackberry. \n\n**Differences:**\n- **Color and Appearance**: Raspberries are bright red and have a hollow core, while blackberries are dark purple to black and have a more solid structure.\n- **Taste**: Raspberries tend to be sweeter with a tart undertone, whereas blackberries have a more robust, slightly tart flavor.\n- **Nutritional Content**: Both berries are nutritious, but they differ slightly in vitamin and mineral content. Raspberries are higher in fiber, while blackberries are richer in vitamin C and K.",
