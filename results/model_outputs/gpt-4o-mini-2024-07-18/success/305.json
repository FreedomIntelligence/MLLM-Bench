    "answer": "When comparing cotton towels and bamboo towels, cotton typically exhibits greater water absorbency when new. Cotton fibers have a natural ability to absorb moisture due to their structure, making them highly effective for drying. Bamboo towels, while also absorbent, may not match the initial absorbency of cotton. However, bamboo towels can have other benefits, such as being softer and more resistant to mildew.",
