    "answer": "In the hush of night, the city breathes,  \nWhere shadows dance with flickering lights,  \nA symphony of whispers on the breeze,  \nAs stars peek through the velvet heights.  \n\nThe water shimmers, a silver thread,  \nReflecting dreams in its gentle sway,  \nWhile laughter mingles with the soft tread,  \nOf souls who wander, lost in the play.  \n\nBuildings rise like sentinels bold,  \nTheir windows aglow with stories untold,  \nEach light a heartbeat, each shadow a sigh,  \nIn the tranquil embrace of the night sky.  \n\nBy the water's edge, the world slows down,  \nAs waves kiss the shore with a tender grace,  \nThe city wears its nocturnal crown,  \nBathed in a glow, a serene embrace.  \n\nSo let the night unfold its tale,  \nIn the interplay of darkness and light,  \nFor in this urban dream, we set sail,  \nFinding peace in the heart of the night.
