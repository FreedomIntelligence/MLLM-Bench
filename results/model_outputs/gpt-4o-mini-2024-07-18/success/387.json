    "answer": "To predict the trajectories of the vehicles in the image, we can consider the following factors based on their current motion:\n\n1. **Direction of Movement**: The white vehicle appears to be turning left while the blue vehicle is moving straight. If both vehicles maintain their current speed and direction, they may intersect at the intersection.\n\n2. **Speed**: If the vehicles are traveling at a higher speed, the time to collision will be shorter. Slower speeds may provide more time for drivers to react.\n\n3. **Road Conditions**: The snowy conditions can significantly affect traction, making it harder for vehicles to stop or maneuver quickly.\n\n### Predictions:\n- The white vehicle, if it continues turning left, will likely move into the path of the blue vehicle unless it stops or alters its course.\n- The blue vehicle, assuming it continues straight, will likely collide with the white vehicle if no action is taken.\n\n### Avoiding Collision:\nDrivers can take the following actions to avoid a collision:\n\n1. **Reduce Speed**: Slowing down can provide more time to react to other vehicles and obstacles.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Maintaining a safe distance can help in reacting to sudden stops or changes in direction.\n\n3. **Use Indicators**: Clearly signaling intentions can help other drivers anticipate movements.\n\n4. **Brake Gently**: In slippery conditions, sudden braking can lead to loss of control. Gentle braking can help maintain traction.\n\n5. **Stay Alert**: Constantly monitoring the surroundings can help in making quick decisions.\n\n6. **Avoid Distractions**: Keeping focus on the road can aid in quicker reactions to potential hazards.\n\nBy applying these strategies, drivers can significantly reduce the risk of collision in adverse weather conditions.",
