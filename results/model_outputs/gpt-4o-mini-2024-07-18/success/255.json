    "answer": "In the illustration of big cats, we can observe distinct species-specific features that help differentiate them:\n\n1. **Tiger**: Tigers are characterized by their striking orange coat with black stripes. They have a robust body, long legs, and a large head. Their facial structure includes prominent whiskers and a strong jaw, adapted for hunting.\n\n2. **Lion**: Lions are notable for their majestic mane, particularly in males, which is unique among big cats. Their body is muscular and stocky, with a broad head and powerful limbs. Lions often exhibit a social structure, living in prides.\n\n3. **Leopard**: Leopards have a more slender build compared to lions and tigers. They feature a golden-yellow coat adorned with rosettes, which provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. Their climbing ability is enhanced by their strong limbs and flexible body.\n\n4. **Cougar (Mountain Lion)**: Cougars have a uniform tawny coat without the distinctive spots or stripes found in other big cats. They possess a long tail and a more agile, elongated body, which aids in their adaptability to various terrains.\n\nThese features not only reflect their adaptations to different environments but also their hunting strategies and social behaviors.",
