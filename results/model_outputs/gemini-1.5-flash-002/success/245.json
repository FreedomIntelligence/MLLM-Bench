There's a subtle fine texture, but no significant bumps or irregularities are visible.  The color is consistent, suggesting a smooth, waxy surface.\n\nThe orange's skin, in contrast, has a noticeably rougher texture.  It's pebbled or bumpy, with many small, slightly raised areas.  The texture is more uneven than the apple's.  The surface appears slightly porous.\n",
