    "answer": "Based on the image, the age group of the individuals depicted is most likely **18-24 years old**.  Several factors support this conclusion:\n\n* **Graduation attire:** They are all wearing graduation gowns and caps, strongly suggesting they have recently completed a high school or university program.  This is typically achieved within the 18-24 age range.\n\n* **Expressions and actions:**  Their joyful, exuberant expressions and celebratory actions (throwing confetti, posing for photos) are consistent with the excitement and relief associated with graduating from a significant educational milestone. This energy is typical of young adults.\n\n* **Overall appearance:** While not definitive, their appearance and demeanor generally align with that of young adults in their late teens or early twenties.\n\nIt's highly improbable that they are significantly older or younger than this range.  The context of graduation firmly places them within the typical age bracket for completing secondary or higher education.\n",
