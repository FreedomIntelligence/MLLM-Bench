    "answer": "Here's how to solve problem 11:\n\n**1. Understanding Equilateral Triangles:**\n\nBoth triangles PQR and PUS are equilateral.  This means all their sides are equal in length, and all their angles are 60°.\n\n**2. Identifying Congruent Triangles:**\n\nWe need to prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.  To do this, we can use one of the congruence postulates (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, HL).  Let's examine the sides and angles:\n\n* **PU = PS:**  Both are sides of the equilateral triangle PUS, so they are equal.\n* **UQ = SR:** Both are sides of the equilateral triangles PQR and PUS, respectively. Since PQR and PUS are equilateral triangles with the same side length (PQ = QR = RP = PU = US = SP), UQ = SR.\n* **PQ = PR:**  Both are sides of the equilateral triangle PQR, so they are equal.\n\n**3. Applying the SSS Postulate:**\n\nWe've shown that all three sides of triangle PUQ are equal to the corresponding three sides of triangle PSR:\n\n* PU = PS\n* UQ = SR\n* PQ = PR\n\nTherefore, by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) postulate, triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTriangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR because of the SSS postulate.  All three corresponding sides are equal in length due to the properties of equilateral triangles PQR and PUS.",
