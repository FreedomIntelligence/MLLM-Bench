    "answer": "The image shows a predominantly young adult and teenage group of protesters.  Several visual cues support this:\n\n* **Clothing style:** The attire is casual and contemporary, typical of teenagers and young adults.  There's a mix of jeans, hoodies, jackets, and sneakers, lacking the formal or professional styles often seen in older age groups.\n\n* **Body language and energy:** The participants appear energetic and engaged in the demonstration, a common characteristic of younger protesters.\n\n* **Lack of visible older individuals:** While there might be some individuals in their late twenties or early thirties, the overwhelming majority appear to be younger. There's a distinct absence of individuals who would visually appear to be middle-aged or older.\n\n* **Signs and slogans:**  The signs are consistent with the concerns and activism typically associated with younger generations.\n\nTherefore, while a precise age range is impossible to determine from an image alone, the overwhelming visual impression is one of teenagers and young adults participating in a protest.  There is a possibility of a few slightly older individuals present, but they are not the dominant demographic.\n",
