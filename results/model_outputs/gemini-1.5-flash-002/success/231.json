    "answer": "The data shows a strong positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita for the three countries listed (US, Brazil, and Madagascar).\n\n* **US:**  Has the highest GDP per capita ($33,582) and a relatively high average night light intensity (4.66). A significant portion of its land area shows high night light intensity (69.32% at levels 0 and above).\n\n* **Brazil:** Has a significantly lower GDP per capita ($3,760) than the US, and a lower average night light intensity (0.63). The majority of its land area is also at high night light intensity (94.02% at levels 0 and above), but the distribution across intensity levels is different from the US.\n\n* **Madagascar:**  Has the lowest GDP per capita ($249) and the lowest average night light intensity (0.02).  Almost all of its land area shows very low night light intensity (99.73% at levels 0 and above).\n\n**Interpretation:**  The higher the GDP per capita, the higher the average night light intensity. This is expected because higher GDP generally correlates with more developed infrastructure, including electricity, which leads to more light at night.  However, it's important to note that this is a correlation, not causation. Other factors contribute to both GDP and electricity consumption.  The data also highlights that even within high night light intensity areas, the distribution across intensity levels can vary significantly, reflecting differences in population density and urbanization patterns.\n",
