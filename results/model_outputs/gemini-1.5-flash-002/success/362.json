    "answer": "The snow falls soft, a muffled shroud,\nOn streets where life once brightly flowed.\nA monochrome world, hushed and still,\nWhere winter's hand holds all its will.\n\nThe buildings stand, in shades of grey,\nTheir windows veiled, the light astray.\nThe falling flakes, a silent dance,\nObscure the world, a fleeting trance.\n\nA lone man walks, a figure small,\nAgainst the snow, he stands up tall.\nHis breath a mist, his steps slow, deep,\nThrough drifts of white, his secrets keep.\n\nThe world is hushed, a muted scene,\nYet in his heart, a fire keen.\nFor life persists, though winter's cold,\nA story told, a strength untold.\n\nThe snow may fall, the wind may blow,\nBut hope remains, a gentle glow.\nIn shades of white, a world anew,\nResilience blooms, forever true.\n\nThe muffled sounds, the frosted pane,\nA winter's tale, a soft refrain.\nBut through the snow, a spirit bright,\nEndures the dark, and claims the light.\n",
