    "answer": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Rewrite the equations:**\n\nThe given equations are:\n\n* x + 1/y = 1  \n* y + 1/z = 1\n\n**2. Solve for x and z:**\n\n* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 1/y from both sides of the first equation:  x = 1 - 1/y = (y - 1)/y\n* **Solve for z:** Subtract 1/y from both sides of the second equation: 1/z = 1 - y  => z = 1/(1 - y)\n\n**3. Substitute and find xyz:**\n\nNow we want to find the value of xyz.  Substitute the expressions for x and z we just found:\n\nxyz = [(y - 1)/y] * y * [1/(1 - y)]\n\n**4. Simplify:**\n\nNotice that 'y' cancels out in the numerator and denominator:\n\nxyz = (y - 1) / (1 - y)\n\nSince (y - 1) = -(1 - y), we can simplify further:\n\nxyz = -1\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-1}$",
