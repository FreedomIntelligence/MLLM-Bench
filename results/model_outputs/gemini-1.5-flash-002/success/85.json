    "answer": "The plant pictured is a Hosta.  Here's a description to help with recognition:\n\n* **Color:** The leaves are predominantly a vibrant chartreuse yellow-green, with irregular streaks and splashes of darker, forest green.  The variegation is quite striking and uneven, not a uniform pattern.\n\n* **Shape:** The leaves are ovate (egg-shaped) with a pointed tip. They are relatively large and somewhat elongated, not perfectly round.  The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, radiating from the center of the plant.\n\n* **Other attributes:** The plant is clump-forming, meaning it grows in a dense cluster. The leaves are smooth and somewhat leathery in texture. The overall shape of the plant is rounded and mounded.  The edges of the leaves are slightly wavy or undulated, not perfectly smooth.  They appear to be growing in mulch.\n",
