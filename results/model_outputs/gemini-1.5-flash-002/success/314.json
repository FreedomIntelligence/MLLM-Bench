    "answer": "Here's how to determine the area of the circle:\n\n**1. Find the radius:**\n\nThe image shows a large square inscribed within the circle.  This square has sides of length 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nThe diagonal of this square is also the diameter of the circle.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere 'a' and 'b' are the sides of the square, and 'c' is the diagonal.\n\n10² + 10² = c²\n100 + 100 = c²\n200 = c²\nc = √200 = 10√2\n\nSince the diameter is 10√2, the radius (r) is half of that:\n\nr = (10√2) / 2 = 5√2\n\n**2. Calculate the area:**\n\nThe area (A) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nA = πr²\n\nSubstituting the radius we calculated:\n\nA = π * (5√2)²\nA = π * 25 * 2\nA = 50π\n\n**3. Approximate the area:**\n\nUsing the approximation π ≈ 3.14159:\n\nA ≈ 50 * 3.14159\nA ≈ 157.08 square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is approximately 157.08 square units.  The exact area is 50π square units.\n",
