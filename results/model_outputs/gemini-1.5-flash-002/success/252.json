The tail is more curved and appears a bit longer.\n\n* **Dog on the Right (Both Images):** The dog on the right has a slightly different posture.  The right hand (from the viewer's perspective) is positioned slightly lower.  There is also a minor difference in the fur around its head; the right image has slightly more detail or \"fuzziness\" to the fur.\n\n\nThe overall scene, the books, backpacks, and grass remain identical.  The changes are minor and likely intended as a subtle \"spot the difference\" exercise.\n",
