There is no natural symbiotic or mutually beneficial relationship; instead, the leopard seal is a predator, and the penguin is its prey.  The leopard seal's open mouth and proximity to the penguin clearly illustrate this.  The penguin is likely fleeing or attempting to evade the seal.  In their natural habitat, this interaction would represent a common hunting scenario for the leopard seal.\n",
