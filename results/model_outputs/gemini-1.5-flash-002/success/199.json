It shows the test functioned as intended.\n\n* **The line labeled \"T\" (test):** This line indicates the presence of COVID-19 antigens.  Since this line is present, along with the control line, it confirms a positive result.\n\nA negative result would only show the control line (\"C\").  A faint or unclear test line might indicate a low viral load or require a repeat test.  Always follow the instructions included with the test kit for proper interpretation.\n",
