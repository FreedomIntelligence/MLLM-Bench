The person starts lying down and progresses through a series of leg and body movements.\n\nThe next action (T6) would likely involve the person continuing to lower their legs to the floor while maintaining an upright torso.  The legs would likely bend at the knee, and the person may eventually sit completely upright in a chair or on the edge of the table.  The arrows in T5 suggest a controlled and gradual lowering of the legs.\n",
