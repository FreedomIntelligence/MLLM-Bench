    "answer": "Let's analyze each equation:\n\n1. **a³ ÷ a⁵ = a³⁻⁵ = a⁻² = 1/a² (a ≠ 0)**\n\nThis equation is correct.  When dividing exponential terms with the same base, you subtract the exponents.  a⁻² is equivalent to 1/a².  The condition a ≠ 0 is necessary because division by zero is undefined.\n\n2. **(0.0001)⁰ = (100000)⁰**\n\nThis equation is correct. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1.\n\n3. **m³ ÷ m³ = m³⁻³ = m⁰ = 1**\n\nThis equation is correct.  Similar to equation (1), subtracting exponents and noting that any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1.\n\n4. **8x¹⁰ ÷ 2x² = 6x⁸**\n\nThis equation is incorrect.  8x¹⁰ ÷ 2x² = (8/2)x¹⁰⁻² = 4x⁸.  The given answer is 6x⁸ which is wrong.\n\n5. **(x²)² ÷ xⁿ = x²**\n\nThis equation is incorrect. (x²)² = x⁴.  Therefore, x⁴ ÷ xⁿ = x⁴⁻ⁿ = x².  This implies 4 - n = 2, which means n = 2.  The equation doesn't hold true for all values of 'n'.  It's only true when n = 2.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOut of the five equations, three are correct (1, 2, and 3).",
