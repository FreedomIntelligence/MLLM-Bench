There is no visible debris-clearing activity taking place, nor is there any safety gear evident.  A lone child stands amidst the ruins, indicating a lack of immediate rescue or safety measures.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this image:\n\n* **Rescue Safety:** Appears very low.  The presence of the child unsupervised in a hazardous environment highlights a lack of safety precautions and potential dangers from sharp debris, unstable structures, and residual hazards from the fire.\n\n* **Efficiency of Debris Clearing:**  Zero.  No clearing efforts are visible.\n\n\nTo accurately assess rescue safety and efficiency, more information is needed.  The image only captures a snapshot of a post-disaster scene and doesn't show the actions (or lack thereof) of emergency services.\n",
