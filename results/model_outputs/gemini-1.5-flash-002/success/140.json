    "answer": "This meme uses several elements of humor to create its comedic effect:\n\n* **Irony:** The core humor stems from the irony of the situation.  A woman expresses her hatred of dogs, yet the next panel shows a large, adorable Shiba Inu (a popular dog breed) sitting in the car, seemingly accepted by the man.  The juxtaposition of her statement with the reality of the situation is inherently ironic.\n\n* **Unexpectedness/Surprise:** The sudden appearance of the large Shiba Inu is unexpected, breaking the established context. This element of surprise contributes significantly to the humor.\n\n* **Absurdity:** The sheer size of the Shiba Inu in the car, and its seemingly calm acceptance by the driver, is absurd and unrealistic.  This absurdity adds to the comedic effect.\n\n* **Visual Humor:** The meme's style, a pop-art-like comic strip, enhances the humor. The exaggerated features of the characters and the clear distinction between the panels contribute to the overall comedic tone.\n\n* **Memetic Humor:** The inclusion of the \"This is the way!\" phrase and the NAFO/OFAN logo (associated with online pro-Ukraine communities) adds a layer of memetic humor. This will only be fully understood by those familiar with these online communities and their associated memes. This leverages pre-existing humor and cultural references.\n\n\nThe overall type of humor is primarily **ironic**, but it also incorporates elements of **absurd humor** and **visual humor**.  The memetic elements add another layer of context and humor for those familiar with the online culture it references.\n",
