Even a small amount can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  The symptoms can be quite severe.\n\nWhile a definitive identification from an image alone is difficult and should never be relied upon for consumption, the characteristics in the picture (clustered growth, color, shape) strongly suggest *Hypholoma fasciculare*.  **Never consume wild mushrooms unless you are 100% certain of their identification by an expert.**\n",
