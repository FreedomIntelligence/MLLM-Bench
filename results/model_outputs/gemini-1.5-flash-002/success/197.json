    "answer": "That looks like a superficial partial-thickness burn.  It's characterized by redness, blistering, and some damage to the top layers of skin.  It doesn't appear to be deep enough to involve the deeper layers of skin (dermis).\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* **Keep it clean:** Gently wash the area with mild soap and cool water once or twice a day.  Avoid scrubbing. Pat it dry.\n* **Don't break the blisters:**  Leave intact blisters alone.  Breaking them increases the risk of infection.\n* **Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment:** This helps prevent infection.  A product like bacitracin or neosporin is suitable.\n* **Keep it covered:**  A loose, clean bandage will protect the wound from further irritation and infection.  Change the bandage daily or as needed.\n* **Elevate the hand:**  If possible, keep your hand elevated to reduce swelling.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relief:**  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain and inflammation.\n* **Monitor for signs of infection:** Watch for increased pain, swelling, redness spreading beyond the initial burn area, pus, or fever.  If any of these occur, seek medical attention immediately.\n* **Avoid harsh chemicals and irritants:**  Keep the area away from soaps, lotions, and other substances that could irritate the wound.\n* **Consider a cool compress:**  For pain relief, apply a cool (not cold) compress for 10-15 minutes at a time, several times a day.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\n\n* If the burn is larger than 3 inches in diameter.\n* If the burn is deep (goes beyond the top layer of skin).\n* If you have signs of infection (as mentioned above).\n* If the pain is severe and not controlled by over-the-counter pain relievers.\n* If you have any concerns or questions about the healing process.\n\n\nThis advice is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice.  If you have any concerns, it's always best to consult a doctor or other healthcare professional.\n",
