The stew appears to contain various ingredients including what looks like:\n\n* **Meat:** Possibly chicken or pork, in chunks.\n* **Vegetables/Tubers:**  Light-colored pieces that could be potatoes or other root vegetables.\n* **Mushrooms/Other Fungi:** Round, light-colored pieces that could be mushrooms or another type of fungus.\n* **Glass Noodles (or similar):**  Translucent strands visible in the soup.\n\nIn the background, there are piles of what appear to be:\n\n* **Abalone:** Several abalone shells are visible, indicating that this ingredient might also be part of the meal, possibly prepared separately.\n* **Sea Cucumber (possibly):** Dark, almost black, oblong pieces that could be sea cucumber.
