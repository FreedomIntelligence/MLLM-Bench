    "answer": "Here's how to solve this problem and the methodology used:\n\n**1. Find the midpoint:**\n\n* The given points (1, -2) and (3, 2) are endpoints of a diameter of the circle.\n* The midpoint of a diameter is the center of the circle.  We find the midpoint using the midpoint formula:\n   Midpoint = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2) = ((1 + 3)/2, (-2 + 2)/2) = (2, 0)\n\n**2. Find the radius:**\n\n* The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. We can use the distance formula between the center (2, 0) and either of the given points. Let's use (3, 2):\n   Radius (r) = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²) = √((3 - 2)² + (2 - 0)²) = √(1² + 2²) = √5\n\n**3. Write the equation of the circle:**\n\n* The general equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.\n* Substituting our values, we get: (x - 2)² + (y - 0)² = (√5)²\n\n**4. Simplify the equation:**\n\n* This simplifies to: (x - 2)² + y² = 5\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumference is **(x - 2)² + y² = 5**\n\n**Methodological Approach:**\n\nThe solution uses the following geometric principles and formulas:\n\n* **Midpoint Formula:** This formula efficiently finds the center of the circle given two endpoints of its diameter.\n* **Distance Formula:** This formula calculates the distance between two points, which is used to determine the radius of the circle.\n* **Equation of a Circle:**  The standard form of the equation of a circle is used to express the relationship between the x and y coordinates of any point on the circle and its center and radius.\n\nThis problem demonstrates a straightforward application of these fundamental concepts in coordinate geometry.\n",
