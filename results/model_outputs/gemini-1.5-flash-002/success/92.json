The top two panels show a person holding a broom in front of their face, creating a comedic effect. The bottom left panel shows the same person dressed in a makeshift Viking costume using household items, including a metal bowl as a helmet and the broom as hair. The bottom right panel shows an animated Viking character with similar long hair/beard. The overall theme is a funny comparison between a regular broom and a Viking's hair/beard, using creative costuming.\n\n\n**Hashtag:** #BroomVikingCosplay",
