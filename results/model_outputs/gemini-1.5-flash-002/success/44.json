Raspberries are characterized by their bright red color, a slightly tart flavor, and their delicate, easily-separating drupelets (the little individual segments).\n\nThe dark purple berries are blackberries. Blackberries are darker in color, almost black, and have a more intense, slightly sweeter flavor than raspberries.  Their drupelets are also more fused together than those of raspberries.",
