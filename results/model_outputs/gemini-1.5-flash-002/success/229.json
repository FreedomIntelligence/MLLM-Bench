This is an example of **brood parasitism**.\n\nThe cuckoo is a brood parasite.  It lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, like the robin.  The cuckoo chick then hatches and often ejects the host's eggs or chicks from the nest.  The unsuspecting host bird, like the robin in the picture, then raises the cuckoo chick as its own, even though it's not genetically related.  The relationship is exploitative, benefiting the cuckoo at the expense of the robin.\n",
