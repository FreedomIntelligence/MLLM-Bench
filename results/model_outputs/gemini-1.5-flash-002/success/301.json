    "answer": "Here's how to solve this puzzle:\n\n**1. Find the Value of an Apple:**\n\n* The first equation shows two apples equal 2:  Apple + Apple = 2.  Therefore, one apple = 1.\n\n**2. Find the Value of a Banana:**\n\n* The second equation shows an apple (1) plus a banana equals 4: 1 + Banana = 4.  Therefore, one banana = 3.\n\n**3. Find the Value of a Strawberry:**\n\n* The third equation shows a banana (3) plus a strawberry equals 7: 3 + Strawberry = 7. Therefore, one strawberry = 4.\n\n**4. Solve the Arithmetic:**\n\n* The problem is (1 apple + 3 bananas) x 2 strawberries = ?\n* Substitute the values: (1 + 3 * 3) x 2 * 4 = ?\n* Calculate: (1 + 9) x 8 = 10 x 8 = 80\n\nTherefore, the answer to the arithmetic is $\\boxed{80}$\n\nTo complete the puzzle, you should select the **strawberry** to place in the second row and first column.",
