    "answer": "The computer screen has sustained significant damage.  There's a spiderweb pattern of cracks radiating from a central point, indicating a strong impact.  The cracks extend across a large portion of the screen's surface.  The damage is severe enough that the screen is likely unusable, and the display may be distorted or completely black.\n\nPossible repair options:\n\n* **Screen Replacement:** This is the most likely solution.  The damaged screen will need to be completely replaced with a new one.  This will require professional repair, either by a certified repair shop or the manufacturer.  The cost will depend on the model of the computer and the availability of replacement parts.\n\n* **Repair Attempt (Not Recommended):**  While some minor cracks might be repaired with specialized adhesives, the extent of the damage in this image makes a DIY repair extremely unlikely to succeed and likely to cause further damage.  Attempting a DIY repair could void any warranty.\n\n\n**In summary:**  Due to the severity of the damage, a professional screen replacement is the only viable and recommended repair option.  Contacting the manufacturer or a reputable repair shop for a quote is the next step.\n",
