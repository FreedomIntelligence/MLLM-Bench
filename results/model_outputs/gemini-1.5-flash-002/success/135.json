The boy who is separate appears to be signaling the group to move or stop.\n\n**Game Rule (Inferred):**  The basic rule would involve the \"it\" player giving a signal (like \"green light\" or a wave) for the chain of children to advance towards them.  When the \"it\" player gives a stopping signal (like \"red light\" or turns their back), the children must freeze.  Any child who moves after the stopping signal is given might be \"out\" or have to return to the starting point.  The game continues until one child reaches the \"it\" player.\n",
