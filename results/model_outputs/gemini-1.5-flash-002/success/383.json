    "answer": "The skater boy is likely to land on the nearby ramp in front of him.  This is a prediction based on his trajectory and body position.\n\nThe risk assessment is moderate to high.  The factors contributing to the risk include:\n\n* **Height:** He's at a considerable height, meaning a fall could result in injury.\n* **Landing:** The precision required to land cleanly on the ramp is high. A slight miscalculation could lead to a fall.\n* **Speed:** While not explicitly shown, his speed is likely significant given the jump.  Higher speed increases the impact force of a potential fall.\n* **Surface:** Concrete is a hard surface, offering little to no give in a fall.\n\nWhile skilled skaters perform similar maneuvers regularly, the inherent risks associated with this type of jump should not be underestimated.  A successful landing depends heavily on the skater's skill, balance, and precise execution.\n",
