Arrive late, or arrive dramatically.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Self-deprecating):**\n\n\"This is my 'I haven't worked out in months' workout.\" or \"Adulting is hard.  This is my 'adulting' transportation.\"\n\n\n**Option 3 (Exaggerated):**\n\n\"Faster than a speeding bullet... well, maybe a slightly slower bullet.\" or \"Breaking the sound barrier... one tiny scooter wheel at a time.\"\n\n**Option 4 (Referencing the backpack):**\n\n\"Carrying the weight of the world... one scooter ride at a time.\" or \"My escape plan.  (Contents of backpack: snacks, extra socks, and a slightly deflated ego).\"\n\n\n**Option 5 (Simple & Sweet):**\n\n\"Scootin' on outta here!\"\n\n\nThe humor comes from the contrast between the man's serious expression and the relatively mundane activity of scooter riding,  exaggerated speed, and the relatable situations implied in some of the captions.  The motion blur adds to the comedic effect.\n",
