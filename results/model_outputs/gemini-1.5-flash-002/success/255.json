    "answer": "Here's a description of the species-specific features of the big cats depicted in the image:\n\n* **Tiger ( *Panthera tigris*)**: The tiger is easily identified by its distinctive orange and black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in its natural habitat.  Its body is relatively long and slender, and it has a powerful build. The head is rounder than the lion's, and the stripes extend to the face.\n\n* **Lion (*Panthera leo*)**: The male lion is characterized by its prominent mane, a feature absent in the female.  The lion's body is robust and muscular, and its overall coloration is a uniform tawny or light brown.  The mane is typically a darker brown or even black.  The face is broader and more rounded than the tiger's.\n\n* **Cougar/Puma (*Puma concolor*)**: The cougar, also known as a mountain lion or puma, has a uniformly colored coat, typically tawny or brownish-gray, with no stripes or spots. It has a long, muscular body, a relatively short tail, and a small, rounded head.  Its overall appearance is sleek and streamlined.\n\n* **Lioness with cubs (*Panthera leo*)**: The lioness lacks the mane, exhibiting the same tawny coloration as the male but without the prominent mane. The cubs are smaller versions of the adult lioness, also tawny-colored, though their coats might appear slightly lighter or fuzzier.\n\n\nThe illustration effectively highlights the key differences in coat pattern (stripes vs. uniform color), mane presence (male lion only), body shape (slender tiger vs. robust lion), and head shape.\n",
