The sections visible in the image are primarily from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).  While earlier walls existed in the area, the Ming Dynasty undertook extensive repairs, rebuilding, and expansion of the wall, resulting in much of what we see today.  Therefore, while the location has a history going back much further, the specific structures shown in the picture are primarily from the **Ming Dynasty period**.\n",
