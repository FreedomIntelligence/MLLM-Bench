    "answer": "Here's how to calculate the percentage increase in Total Income:\n\n**1. Find the difference:**\n\n* Total Income (30 Sep 2023): 1,751.00\n* Total Income (30 June 2023): 1,552.63\n* Difference: 1,751.00 - 1,552.63 = 198.37\n\n**2. Calculate the percentage increase:**\n\n* Percentage increase = (Difference / Total Income (30 June 2023)) * 100\n* Percentage increase = (198.37 / 1,552.63) * 100 \n* Percentage increase ≈ 12.77%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in Total Income from the quarter ending 30 June 2023 to the quarter ending 30 September 2023 is approximately **12.77%**.\n",
