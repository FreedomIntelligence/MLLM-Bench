    "answer": "That's an **infrared oscillating heater**.\n\nThe key difference between this and a general fan is that it **produces heat**, while a general fan only circulates existing air.  This heater uses infrared technology to generate heat, which is then distributed by the oscillating function (the ability to swivel its output).  A general fan, on the other hand, doesn't generate heat; it simply moves air to create a cooling effect or to improve air circulation.\n",
