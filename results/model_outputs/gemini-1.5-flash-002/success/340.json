While the image itself doesn't definitively prove discrimination, it raises concerns about potential racial bias in policing.  The context surrounding the arrest (which is not provided in the image) is crucial to determining whether discrimination occurred.  The disproportionate number of arrests of Black individuals compared to white individuals in similar situations is a well-documented issue in many parts of the world, fueling concerns about systemic racism in law enforcement.  Therefore, while the image alone is not conclusive, it evokes a strong possibility of discriminatory practices.\n",
