    "answer": "This speech argues for the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.  The speaker presents three main reasons: fairness, educational growth, and uniform evaluation.\n\nThe speech utilizes several rhetorical codes:\n\n* **Hypophora:** The speaker poses a question (\"Suppose there is no college entrance exam...\") and immediately answers it, engaging the audience and building a logical argument.\n\n* **Anaphora:** The repeated phrase \"they have\" emphasizes the advantages of students from wealthier backgrounds, highlighting the unfairness of the system *before* the speaker introduces the solution (the exam).\n\n* **Antithesis:** The contrasting ideas of \"Your family or money doesn't help\" and \"it's all about how much you study\" create a powerful statement about meritocracy and the leveling effect of the exams.\n\n* **Pathos:** The speaker appeals to the audience's emotions by mentioning students from poor families who changed their lives through hard work and the exams. This creates empathy and support for the speaker's position.\n\n* **Ethos:** The speaker uses Einstein's quote to lend credibility to the argument that exams benefit students beyond rote memorization, developing their thinking skills.\n\n* **Metaphor:** The description of the exams as \"keys to the future\" creates a powerful image and emphasizes their importance in achieving dreams.\n",
