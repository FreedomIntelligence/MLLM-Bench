    "answer": "The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between the vaccination rate and excess deaths.  As the vaccination rate increases, the number of excess deaths tends to decrease.  The OLS slope of -0.59 indicates that for every 1% increase in the vaccination rate, excess deaths decrease by approximately 0.59.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with an 85% vaccination rate, we can use the regression line.  Looking at the graph, the regression line intersects at a point slightly above 20 excess deaths when the vaccination rate is around 85%. Therefore, we can estimate that a state with an 85% vaccination rate would have approximately **20-25 excess deaths**.  It's important to note that this is just an approximation, and the actual number could vary due to other factors not included in this model.\n",
