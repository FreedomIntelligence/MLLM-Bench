    "answer": "The chart shows the global mean temperature from various datasets, compared to the average temperature between 1850 and 1900.  The key implication is a clear and significant upward trend in global mean temperature over time, indicating global warming.  The multiple datasets show a high degree of agreement on this trend, strengthening the conclusion.  The warming is particularly pronounced in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century.\n",
