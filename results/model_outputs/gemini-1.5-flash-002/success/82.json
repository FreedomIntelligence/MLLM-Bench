    "answer": "The paintings appear to be done in **oil paints** or possibly **acrylics** with a heavy impasto technique.  The thick, textured application of paint with visible brushstrokes is characteristic of both mediums.  Watercolor wouldn't achieve this level of texture and three-dimensionality.  The slight glossiness also suggests oil paint, but it could be a glossy acrylic medium.\n",
