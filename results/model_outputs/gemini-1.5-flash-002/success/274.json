They could be in a meeting, brainstorming, or discussing a project.  The woman may be presenting an idea, and the man is taking notes.\n\n* **Client and consultant/advisor:** The woman could be a client explaining her needs, and the man is a consultant taking notes and formulating a plan.\n\n* **Job interview:** The woman could be interviewing for a position, and the man is the interviewer.\n\n* **Superior and subordinate:** The woman could be a manager giving instructions or feedback to a subordinate (the man).\n\n* **Negotiators:** They could be business partners or representatives from different companies negotiating a deal.\n\n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to determine the exact relationship, but a professional business context is the most probable.\n",
