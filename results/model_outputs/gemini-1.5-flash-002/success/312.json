    "answer": "Here's how to solve the integral:\n\n**1. Rewrite the integral:**\n\nThe integral is:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (ln(x) / 4sin²(ln(x))) dx\n\n**2. Substitution:**\n\nLet u = ln(x).  Then du = (1/x) dx.  Also, when x = 0, u = -∞, and when x = 1, u = 0.  We also have x = e<sup>u</sup>, so dx = e<sup>u</sup> du.  Substituting these into the integral gives:\n\nI = ∫₋∞⁰ (u / 4sin²(u)) e<sup>u</sup> du\n\n**3.  This integral is difficult to solve analytically.**  There's no elementary function that represents its antiderivative.  Standard integration techniques (like integration by parts or trigonometric substitution) won't yield a closed-form solution.  Numerical methods would be required to approximate the value of I.\n\n**4. Numerical Approximation (using Wolfram Alpha or similar software):**\n\nUsing numerical integration techniques (like Simpson's rule or more advanced methods), software such as Wolfram Alpha can provide an approximate value for the definite integral.  The result will be a numerical approximation, not an exact symbolic answer.  I cannot perform this calculation here.  You would need to input the integral into a computational tool to get the numerical value.\n\n\nIn summary, while a precise analytical solution is not readily available, a numerical approximation can be obtained using computational software.\n",
