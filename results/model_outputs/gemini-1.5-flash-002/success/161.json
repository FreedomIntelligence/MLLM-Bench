By releasing a competitive open-source model, the researchers aim to promote inclusivity and enable broader use of advanced language technologies, thereby potentially fostering innovation and development in various fields worldwide.  The availability of the data, code, and models further enhances the impact by allowing others to build upon and improve the work.\n",
