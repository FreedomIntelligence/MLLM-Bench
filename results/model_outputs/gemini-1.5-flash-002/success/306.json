    "answer": "The glass falling on the wooden floor is more likely to break.\n\nThe foam play mat, even though it's not very thick, provides some cushioning and energy absorption.  This will reduce the impact force on the glass compared to the direct impact of the glass hitting the hard wooden floor.  The harder surface will transfer more of the energy of the fall directly to the glass, increasing the likelihood of breakage.\n",
