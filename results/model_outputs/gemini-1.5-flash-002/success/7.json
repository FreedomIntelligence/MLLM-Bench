    "answer": "That's a saxophone.\n\nSaxophones are woodwind instruments that produce sound through vibrations of a reed in a mouthpiece.  The player manipulates the keys to change the length of the air column within the instrument, altering the pitch.  Techniques include breath control for dynamics (loudness and softness), finger dexterity for accurate note playing, and embouchure (mouth position) for tone quality.  Different saxophone styles exist (e.g., bebop, jazz, classical), each employing different techniques and musical approaches.\n",
