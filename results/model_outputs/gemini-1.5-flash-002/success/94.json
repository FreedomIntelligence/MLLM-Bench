This might be appropriate if you want to spark discussion about the history of pseudoscience.\n\n* **#HistoricalChart:** A more general option that focuses on the visual aspect of the image.\n\nYou could also combine several of these hashtags for broader reach.  For example: `#Phrenology #VintageScience #MedicalHistory`\n\n\nThe best choice will depend on your intended audience and the message you want to convey.\n",
