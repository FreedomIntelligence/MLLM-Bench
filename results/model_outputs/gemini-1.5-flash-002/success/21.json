    "answer": "The image shows a man performing a **barbell bench press**.\n\n**Technical Essentials:**\n\nThe barbell bench press is a compound exercise that primarily works the pectoral muscles (chest), triceps (back of the upper arm), and anterior deltoids (front of the shoulders).  Proper form is crucial to avoid injury.  Key aspects include:\n\n* **Lie flat:** The lifter lies supine on a weight bench with their feet flat on the floor.\n* **Grip:**  The lifter grasps the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n* **Lowering:** The barbell is lowered slowly and controlled to the chest, touching the chest lightly.\n* **Pushing:** The barbell is then pushed back up to the starting position, extending the arms fully but avoiding locking the elbows.\n* **Breathing:**  Inhale during the lowering phase and exhale during the pushing phase.\n* **Spotter:**  A spotter is recommended, especially when lifting heavier weights, to assist in case of failure.\n\n\nIncorrect form can lead to injuries, particularly to the shoulders, elbows, and wrists.  It's important to start with lighter weights to master the technique before increasing the load.\n",
