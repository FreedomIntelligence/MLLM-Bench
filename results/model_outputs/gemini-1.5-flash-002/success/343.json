While the sign doesn't explicitly target visually impaired people, its enforcement prevents them from accessing the establishment with their necessary assistance animal, thus discriminating against them based on their disability.  The sign should be accompanied by information about exceptions for service animals, or the establishment should make reasonable accommodations to comply with disability access laws.\n",
