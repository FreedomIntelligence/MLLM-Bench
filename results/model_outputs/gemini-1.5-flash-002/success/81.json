    "answer": "Here are the cooking methods likely used for the food items shown in the image:\n\n* **Grilling/Pan-frying:** The patties in the buns and the separate patties appear to be grilled or pan-fried.  The browning and potential charring suggest direct heat application.\n\n* **Deep Frying:**  The lighter-colored, crumbly-looking items (possibly some kind of fritter or croquette)  likely underwent deep frying.\n\n* **Skewering/Grilling:** The chicken tikka or similar skewers clearly show grilling as the cooking method. The skewers are arranged to allow even cooking over a heat source.\n\n* **Baking:** The buns themselves are baked.\n\n\nIt's difficult to be completely certain without more information, but these are the most probable cooking methods based on the visual appearance of the food.  The sauces and marinades used would be added after the primary cooking method.\n",
