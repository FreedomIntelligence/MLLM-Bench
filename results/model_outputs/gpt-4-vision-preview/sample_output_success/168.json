The master bedroom and one other bedroom are located at opposite ends of the floor plan, with their own dedicated bathrooms, ensuring privacy for occupants.\n\nThe living room, dining area, and kitchen form the central communal space, which is easily accessible from all bedrooms. The prayer room is also conveniently located near the living area.\n\nOverall, the layout strikes a balance between providing privacy for the bedrooms while maintaining easy access to the shared living spaces. The separation of private and public zones seems well-designed for the intended purpose of the floor plan."
