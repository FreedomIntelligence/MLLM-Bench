The entire scene is composed of countless tiny dots or points of pure color that blend together optically when viewed from a distance.\n\nThe vibrant, warm hues like yellows, oranges, and reds convey a sense of energy and vibrancy, capturing the warmth and light of the sun-drenched coastal scene. The complementary blues and purples create a cool contrast, suggesting depth and atmosphere.\n\nThe fragmented, broken brushwork and lack of distinct outlines give the figures and landscape an almost shimmering, ethereal quality. This diffuse, almost dreamlike rendering evokes a mood of tranquility and leisure, perfectly suited to depicting this idyllic seaside setting with its relaxed figures.\n\nThe Pointillist technique, with its separation of colors into individual dots, creates a vibrant, shimmering surface that seems to pulsate with light and energy, capturing the dazzling Mediterranean light and heat. Overall, the style conveys a sense of joy, serenity and the pleasures of warm sunny days by the sea."
