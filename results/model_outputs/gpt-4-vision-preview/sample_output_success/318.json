Let's use the point (3, 2):\n\nr = √((3 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2)\nr = √(9 + 4)\nr = √13\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumference is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 13\n\nThis equation represents a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of √13 units.\n\nThe methodological approach used here is:\n1. Identify the center of the circle from the given information (in this case, the origin (0, 0)).\n2. Use the given points on the circumference to calculate the radius using the distance formula.\n3. Substitute the center coordinates (h, k) and the calculated radius (r) into the general equation of a circle: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.\n4. Simplify the equation to obtain the final form.\n\nBy following this systematic approach, we can derive the equation of the circumference for any given circle in the Cartesian coordinate system."
