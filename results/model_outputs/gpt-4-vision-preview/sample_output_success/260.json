The evidence includes people wading through knee-deep water on what seems to be a residential street or neighborhood, carrying belongings and supplies above the water level.

This situation is consistent with the aftermath of heavy rainfall or a flood event caused by overflowing rivers, storm surges, or other weather-related incidents that can lead to widespread inundation."
