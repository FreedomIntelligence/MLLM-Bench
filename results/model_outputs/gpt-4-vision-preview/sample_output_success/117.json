His mouth is wide open in an apparent yell or shout, and his brow is furrowed in a scowl. This extreme reaction could potentially be triggered by a highly stressful or infuriating situation he is dealing with, such as technical difficulties with the phone or computer equipment in front of him. Workplace pressures, customer service issues, or problems with technology can sometimes lead to such outbursts of exasperation if the circumstances become overwhelming. However, without more context, I can only speculate about the specific cause based on his visible emotional state."
