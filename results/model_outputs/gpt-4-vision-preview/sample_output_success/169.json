Let the front cover down.\n3. Then the back cover.\n4. Then open a few leaves (pages) in the front.\n5. Then a few at the back, alternating front and back.\n6. Gently press them down until the center is reached.\n7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 two or three times to limber up the bindings.\n\nThe instructions emphasize opening the book gently and carefully, without forcing or roughly handling it, to avoid damaging the binding or causing the leaves (pages) to loosen.\n\nThe clarity of the instructions is quite good, with each step clearly illustrated through simple diagrams. The language used is straightforward and easy to understand. The effectiveness is also reasonable, as the steps seem logical and aimed at preventing damage to a new book when opening it for the first time.\n\nHowever, some additional context or explanation could have made the instructions even more effective. For example, the rationale behind alternating between the front and back pages is not explicitly stated, though it likely helps distribute the opening force evenly across the binding.\n\nOverall, while not perfect, the instructions provided in the image appear to be reasonably clear and effective in guiding the proper way to open a new book without damaging it."
