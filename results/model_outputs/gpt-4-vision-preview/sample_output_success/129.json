The character's exaggerated facial features, such as the furrowed brows, squinting eyes, and bared teeth, convey an intense expression of anger or rage. The red color and textured appearance further amplify the sense of intensity and aggression. The clenched fists and overall tense body language also contribute to the perception of a severe emotional state being portrayed."
