Given his stance and movement, it seems plausible that he could attempt a shot or score points within the next 0.1 second, as that is a very brief window of time in a live basketball play. However, without seeing the full context and flow of the game action, I cannot definitively confirm if scoring is imminent within that precise 0.1 second timeframe."
