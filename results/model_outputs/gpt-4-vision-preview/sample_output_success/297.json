The large rectangular ottomans in the center suggest that this sofa likely converts into a bed by extending those ottomans to create a flat sleeping surface when pushed together with the surrounding seating sections. The modular, multi-piece construction is a common design for convertible sofa beds that allow the pieces to reconfigure from a seating arrangement into a bed layout. So while I cannot confirm definitively, the design and structure strongly indicate this sofa has the capability to convert into a bed configuration."
