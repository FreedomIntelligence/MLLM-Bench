The brushwork has a dimensional, sculpted quality that suggests the artist applied the paint in thick, expressive layers to create the raised surfaces and fine details of the petals, leaves, and other botanical elements. The rich colors and visible brushstrokes are characteristic of oil or heavy acrylic painting techniques rather than watercolor or thinner paint applications."
