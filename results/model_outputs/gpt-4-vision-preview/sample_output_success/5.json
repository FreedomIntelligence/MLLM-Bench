Unlike a typical fan that circulates air, this device generates warmth through infrared or radiant heating elements, which are visible as the glowing red and yellow bars.\n\nThe key difference from a regular fan is that this device is designed primarily for heating purposes rather than just air circulation. It provides warmth directly to objects and people in its vicinity through infrared radiation, without necessarily moving large volumes of air like a fan would. The device also comes with a remote control for convenient adjustment of settings from a distance."
