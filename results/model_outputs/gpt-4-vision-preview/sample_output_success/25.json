She is holding a microphone close to her mouth and has her eyes closed in an expressive manner, suggesting she is vocalizing or singing into the microphone. Her hair is flowing dramatically, likely from movement or wind effects used during a live performance. The microphone indicates she is likely a singer, musician, or performer using it to amplify her voice for an audience, though I cannot identify her specifically."
