The image on the right uses visual hyperbole to exaggerate the challenge or difficulty of the situation by depicting the baby as a construction worker trapped inside a toolbox surrounded by tools and machinery.\n\nThis visual metaphor humorously contrasts the innocence and serenity of the sleeping baby with the chaotic and dangerous environment of a construction site. The exaggeration creates a humorous juxtaposition by implying that caring for a baby feels as challenging and overwhelming as being stuck in a confined space filled with hazardous tools and equipment.\n\nThe hyperbole is effective in eliciting laughter because it takes the common sentiment of new parents feeling overwhelmed or unprepared and amplifies it to an absurd extreme. The comedic effect arises from the stark contrast between the reality of the peaceful sleeping baby and the outlandish metaphorical depiction of the perceived difficulty of parenting."
