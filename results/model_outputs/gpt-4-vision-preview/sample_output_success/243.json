Its coloration is predominantly brownish-red, with some golden highlights. Its body structure appears reptilian or draconic, with a long neck, powerful jaws, and wings or fin-like appendages protruding from its back.\n\nIn contrast, the monster on the right has a more furry or shaggy texture, with a thick coat of hair or fur covering its body. Its coloration is primarily dark brown or blackish, with some lighter brown tones. Its body structure is more ape-like or gorilla-like, with a massive, muscular build, long arms, and a broad, powerful stance.\n\nBoth monsters have fierce, snarling expressions and are engaged in what appears to be an intense confrontation or battle, with explosions and destruction visible in the background."
