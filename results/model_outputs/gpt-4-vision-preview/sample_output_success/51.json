The Great Wall was constructed over many centuries, with its origins dating back to the 3rd century BCE during the Qin Dynasty. However, most of the existing sections were built or rebuilt during the Ming Dynasty in the 14th to 17th centuries. The Great Wall stretches across the northern part of China, winding through mountainous terrain, as seen in the image with the autumn foliage on the hills. Its construction is an incredible feat of ancient engineering and labor, and it remains an enduring symbol of Chinese culture and history."
