The different colored lines represent different temperature data sources or analysis methods.\n\nThe overall trend shown by all datasets is an increase in global mean temperature over time, particularly from around the mid-20th century onwards. The temperature anomaly lines trend upwards more steeply in recent decades, implying a accelerating rise in global mean temperatures relative to the 1850-1900 baseline.\n\nWhile there are some minor variations across the different datasets, likely due to methodological differences, they all consistently show a significant warming trend globally since the late 19th century. This chart suggests a pattern of ongoing global temperature rise, which aligns with scientific evidence of human-induced global warming driven by increased greenhouse gas emissions."
