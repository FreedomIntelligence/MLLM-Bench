The image is significantly blurred and lacks clear anatomical details compared to the other scans (a), (b), and (c), which show sharper and more well-defined structures. The blurring in image (d) suggests potential motion artifact or other technical issues during the scan acquisition, rendering the image quality suboptimal for diagnostic purposes. A redo of the scan would likely be recommended to obtain a clearer image for accurate interpretation."
