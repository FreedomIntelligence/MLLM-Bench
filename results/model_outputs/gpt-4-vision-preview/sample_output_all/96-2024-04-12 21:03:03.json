The stylistic features that identify it as Cubist include the fragmented, geometric shapes used to depict the subject's face and body, the flattened forms and lack of depth, and the use of bright, contrasting colors. The artwork demonstrates the Cubist approach of depicting subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, breaking down forms into abstracted planes and shapes. While I cannot identify the specific artist, the bold, expressive style and vibrant palette are characteristic of many Cubist works from that pioneering era of modern art."
