To make sushi rolls like these, you would typically need the following ingredients:\n\n- Sushi rice (short-grain Japanese rice, rice vinegar, sugar, salt)\n- Nori seaweed sheets\n- Fresh sushi-grade raw fish (such as tuna, salmon, yellowtail, or other desired fillings)\n- Vegetables (such as cucumber, avocado, carrots)\n- Condiments and garnishes (soy sauce, wasabi, pickled ginger, sesame seeds)\n\nThe rolls in the image seem to contain fish or seafood fillings, as well as some vegetable components. The green strips are likely chives or green onions used as a garnish. To recreate these sushi rolls, you'd need to prepare sushi rice, carefully roll it up with the desired fillings using the nori sheets, then garnish with the green onion or chive strips once cut into pieces."
