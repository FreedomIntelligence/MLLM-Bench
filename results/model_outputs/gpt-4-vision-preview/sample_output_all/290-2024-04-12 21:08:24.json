Based on its current condition, restoring it to working order would likely require replacing several parts:\n\n1. Tires and inner tubes - The existing tires appear worn out and would need to be replaced with new ones of the appropriate size.\n\n2. Brake system - New brake cables, pads, and potentially brake calipers may be needed to ensure proper braking functionality.\n\n3. Drivetrain - The chain, cassette/freewheel, and possibly the crankset and bottom bracket would likely need replacement due to rust and wear.\n\n4. Handlebar grips and brake levers - New grips and levers could improve comfort and control.\n\n5. Saddle - Depending on its condition, a new saddle may be advisable for comfort.\n\n6. Bearings - The headset, wheel bearings, and potentially bottom bracket bearings may require replacement if they are seized or damaged.\n\nAdditionally, a thorough cleaning, degreasing, and re-greasing of the remaining components would be recommended. The frame itself may also benefit from a fresh coat of paint or rust treatment to protect it from further corrosion.\n\nIt's important to carefully assess the condition of each component and determine if replacement is necessary for safe and reliable operation. Consulting with a professional bike mechanic could also provide valuable guidance on the specific parts and work required for this restoration project."
