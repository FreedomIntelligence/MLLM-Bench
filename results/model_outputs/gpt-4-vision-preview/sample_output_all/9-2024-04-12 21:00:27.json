This modern rail transportation system is distinct from traditional means of transportation like buses, cars, or conventional trains, as it utilizes advanced technology to achieve significantly higher speeds. High-speed rail networks are designed for efficient and rapid transit over long distances, making use of dedicated tracks, aerodynamic train designs, and electric propulsion systems to minimize travel times between cities or regions."
