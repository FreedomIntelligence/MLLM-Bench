The speaker presents three main reasons to support this viewpoint.\n\nThe rhetorical devices used in the speech include:\n\n1. Hypophora: The speaker poses a rhetorical question (\"how would you get into college?\") and then provides an answer, highlighting that family conditions and social status would likely determine admissions without entrance exams.\n\n2. Anaphora: The repetition of \"they have\" to emphasize the advantages of students from better family backgrounds.\n\n3. Antithesis: Contrasting the unfair advantages of family and money with the fairness of entrance exams that test individual effort and ability.\n\n4. Pathos: Appealing to emotions by discussing how entrance exams offer underprivileged students a chance to change their fate.\n\n5. Ethos: Using a quote from Einstein to lend authority and credibility to the argument that exams promote learning beyond just memorization.\n\n6. Metaphor: Describing the exams as \"keys to the future\" to emphasize their importance and potential to unlock opportunities.\n\n7. Concession: Acknowledging the counterargument that exams cause stress, but then refuting it by suggesting stress prepares students for future challenges.\n\nOverall, the speaker employs a range of rhetorical techniques to persuasively argue for the necessity of college entrance exams."
