Frogs (secondary consumers) eat the flies, and snakes (tertiary consumers) prey on the frogs. Finally, eagles (apex predators) consume the snakes.\n\nThe third chain begins with a flower as the producer, supporting small fish (primary consumers) that feed on aquatic plants. These small fish become food for larger fish (secondary consumers), which are subsequently consumed by birds (tertiary consumers) at the top of this aquatic food chain.\n\nIn each case, the energy flows linearly from the producers (plants) through various consumer levels, with energy being transferred and concentrated at each successive trophic level."
