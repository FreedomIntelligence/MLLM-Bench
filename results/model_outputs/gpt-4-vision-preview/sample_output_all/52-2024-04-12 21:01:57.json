Various cultural festivals and events are celebrated around Mount Fuji throughout the year, taking advantage of its stunning natural scenery.\n\nOne of the most famous is the annual Fuji Shibazakura Festival, where millions of pink moss phlox flowers carpet the grounds around the mountain's base, creating a breathtaking floral display. The Fuji Honbayashi Hōjō Matsuri is another significant festival honoring the mountain's spiritual significance, featuring traditional music and dance performances.\n\nDuring the summer months, hiking and climbing Mount Fuji is a popular activity steeped in cultural traditions, with climbers seeking to reach the summit in time for the sunrise. The mountain's iconic profile is also a frequent backdrop for hanami (cherry blossom viewing) celebrations in early spring when the surrounding areas are awash in delicate pink blooms."
