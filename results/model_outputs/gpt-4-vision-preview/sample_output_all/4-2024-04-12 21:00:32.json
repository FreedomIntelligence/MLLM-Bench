An HDMI port for connecting an external display or monitor.\n3. A 3.5mm audio jack, likely for connecting headphones or speakers.\n4. A Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port, which can be used for data transfer, charging, and connecting Thunderbolt-enabled devices.\n5. A power button and LED indicators for power and connectivity status.\n\nThe device is placed on top of what appears to be an iPad, suggesting it is designed to work as a docking station or hub for connecting various peripherals and displays to an iPad or other compatible devices."
