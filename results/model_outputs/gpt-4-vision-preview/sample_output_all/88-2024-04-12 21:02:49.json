AGVs are self-propelled vehicles used for material handling and transportation in industrial settings, such as warehouses, factories, and distribution centers.\n\nThe image shows a long track or guideway on the floor, along with various AGV units positioned on the track. These AGVs likely move autonomously along the predetermined path, transporting goods, materials, or products from one location to another within the facility.\n\nThe functionality of an AGV system is to automate and streamline the movement of materials, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing efficiency in logistics operations. AGVs can follow markers or wires embedded in the floor, use laser guidance, or navigate using sensors and software to find their way around the facility.\n\nThe usage of AGV systems is widespread in modern industrial environments, particularly in sectors like automotive manufacturing, electronics assembly, and e-commerce fulfillment centers, where efficient material handling and transportation are crucial for maintaining productivity and meeting customer demands."
