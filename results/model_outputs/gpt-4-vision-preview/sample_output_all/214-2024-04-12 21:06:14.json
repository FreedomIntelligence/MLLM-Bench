As the vaccination rate increases, the excess deaths tend to decrease. The correlation coefficient of -0.47 indicates a moderate negative linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, I can use the provided OLS slope of -0.59. This slope represents the rate of change in excess deaths for every 1% increase in vaccination rate.\n\nExcess deaths = Intercept + Slope * Vaccination Rate\nIntercept is not provided, but we can estimate it using the data points closest to the regression line.\n\nLet's assume the intercept is around 60 (where the regression line seems to intersect the y-axis).\n\nExcess deaths = 60 + (-0.59 * 85) = 60 - 50.15 = 9.85\n\nTherefore, for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, the predicted excess deaths would be approximately 10 based on the linear regression model shown in the scatter plot.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the linear regression, and there may be other factors influencing excess deaths that are not captured in this simple model."
