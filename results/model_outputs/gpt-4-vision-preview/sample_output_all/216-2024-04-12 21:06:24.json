The pie charts show that the Sukuk (Islamic bonds) segment accounted for a significant 24% share of the total financial value of $3.25 trillion in the Islamic market. The MENA region contributed 31% of the total number of issues globally, with a value of $56,263 million, while other regions accounted for 69% of issues worth $126,452 million.\n\nThe bar chart at the bottom highlights the MENA region's issuances, with Saudi Arabia leading at $42,643 million, followed by Bahrain ($7,218 million), Qatar ($2,125 million), the UAE ($3,500 million), Kuwait ($500 million), and Egypt ($278 million). This breakdown provides insights into the relative contributions and activity levels of different MENA countries in the Islamic financial market.\n\nOverall, the data suggests a substantial and growing Islamic financial market, with the Sukuk segment playing a crucial role. The MENA region emerges as a significant player, particularly Saudi Arabia, while other regions also contribute significantly to the market's growth and development."
