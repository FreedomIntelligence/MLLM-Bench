                "content": "To calculate the area of the circle shown in the image, we need to know the radius of the circle. The radius is given by the numbers shown inside the circle, which is 6 units.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is:\n\nArea = \u03c0 \u00d7 r^2\n\nWhere \u03c0 (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nSubstituting the radius of 6 units into the formula:\n\nArea = \u03c0 \u00d7 (6)^2\n     = \u03c0 \u00d7 36\n     = 3.14159 \u00d7 36\n     = 113.0974 square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle with a radius of 6 units is approximately 113.0974 square units.\n\nTo explain the calculation step-by-step:\n1) The radius of the circle is given as 6 units.\n2) The formula for the area of a circle is Area = \u03c0 \u00d7 r^2, where r is the radius.\n3) We substitute the value of the radius, 6, into the formula: Area = \u03c0 \u00d7 (6)^2\n4) Raising 6 to the power of 2 gives us 36: Area = \u03c0 \u00d7 36\n5) The value of \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159.\n6) Multiplying \u03c0 (3.14159) by 36 gives us the final area: 3.14159 \u00d7 36 = 113.0974 square units.\n\nTherefore, using the given radius of 6 units and the formula for the area of a circle, the calculated area is approximately 113.0974 square units."
