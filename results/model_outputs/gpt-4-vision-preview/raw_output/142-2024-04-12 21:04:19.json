Giving human-like accessories or characteristics to an inanimate object like a fruit can be perceived as amusing due to the incongruity and unexpected juxtaposition.\n\nThe pineapple's sunglasses make it appear as if it has a face and is personified, almost like it's trying to look cool or stylish. This playful humanization of the pineapple breaks from our normal expectations and can elicit amusement or laughter.\n\nThe contrast between the natural, edible fruit and the fashionable sunglasses accessory typically associated with humans adds an element of surprise and whimsy. This imaginative blending of the human and non-human worlds creates a humorous and lighthearted visual joke that can bring a smile to the viewer's face.\n\nOverall, the anthropomorphism achieved by adding human-like accessories to an ordinary fruit disrupts our conventional perceptions, creating an amusing and delightful visual incongruity that can be appreciated for its creativity and humor."
