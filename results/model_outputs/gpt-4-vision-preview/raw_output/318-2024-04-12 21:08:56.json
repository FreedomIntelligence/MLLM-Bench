                "content": "To find the equation of the circumference of the circle shown in the image, we need to use the standard equation of a circle in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nThe general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:\n\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\nFrom the image, we can observe that the center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0), and the two points (3, 2) and (1, -2) lie on the circumference.\n\nTo find the radius, we can use the distance formula between the center and either of the given points. Let's use the point (3, 2):\n\nr = \u221a((3 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2)\nr = \u221a(9 + 4)\nr = \u221a13\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumference is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 13\n\nThis equation represents a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of \u221a13 units.\n\nThe methodological approach used here is:\n1. Identify the center of the circle from the given information (in this case, the origin (0, 0)).\n2. Use the given points on the circumference to calculate the radius using the distance formula.\n3. Substitute the center coordinates (h, k) and the calculated radius (r) into the general equation of a circle: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.\n4. Simplify the equation to obtain the final form.\n\nBy following this systematic approach, we can derive the equation of the circumference for any given circle in the Cartesian coordinate system."
