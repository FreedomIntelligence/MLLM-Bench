This building is considered special and architecturally significant for its distinct triangular shape and wedge-like design. It was one of the tallest buildings in New York City when it was completed in 1902, standing at 87 meters (285 feet) tall with 22 floors.\n\nThe Flatiron Building's unique shape was a creative solution to accommodate the triangular plot of land where it stands, formed by the intersection of Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street. Its striking architecture, with a limestone and terra-cotta facade featuring intricate details and a slender, vertical profile, made it a pioneering example of the skyscraper design that came to define the New York City skyline in the early 20th century."
