It was a joint project between France and the United States, with the statue itself being a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, symbolizing the enduring friendship between the two nations.\n\nThe statue's social and cultural significance is multifaceted. It has come to represent the ideals of liberty, democracy, and freedom that the United States was founded upon. The statue's tablet bears the date of American independence, July 4, 1776, and its iconic design, with the raised arm holding a torch, has become a powerful symbol of enlightenment and hope for immigrants seeking a better life in America.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty has been a welcoming sight for millions of immigrants arriving in New York Harbor, and it has come to symbolize the American dream and the promise of opportunity for people from all walks of life. Its location in New York City, a major gateway for immigrants, has further solidified its status as a beacon of hope and a symbol of the United States as a nation of immigrants."
