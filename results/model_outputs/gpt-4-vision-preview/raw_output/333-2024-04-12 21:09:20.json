While the front display is not visible, the extensive cracking on the back suggests the phone has likely suffered a major impact or drop.\n\nGiven the severity of the damage to the rear glass, it is highly unlikely that the phone would be usable without repair. Cracked or shattered glass can allow dust, moisture, and debris to enter the internal components, potentially causing further issues or malfunctions. Additionally, the shards of broken glass pose a safety hazard during handling.\n\nTo restore full functionality and prevent additional damage, a professional repair would be recommended. This would likely involve replacing the entire rear glass panel and potentially other internal components if they were affected by the impact that caused the shattering."
