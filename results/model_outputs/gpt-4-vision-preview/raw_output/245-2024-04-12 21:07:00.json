The apple has a relatively smooth and even skin surface with a few small blemishes or spots. In contrast, the orange has a rougher, dimpled texture with numerous tiny pits covering its peel, giving it an uneven and bumpy appearance characteristic of citrus fruits. While the apple's skin looks waxy and uniform, the orange's surface has a more textured and irregular quality due to the tiny indentations across its rind."
