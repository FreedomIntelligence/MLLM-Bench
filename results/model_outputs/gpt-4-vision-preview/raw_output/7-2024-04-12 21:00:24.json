Saxophones are played by blowing air into the mouthpiece and using the keys to produce different notes and melodies. They are commonly used in genres like jazz, blues, and rock music. Playing the saxophone requires proper breath control, embouchure (mouth positioning), and finger dexterity to produce the desired sounds and techniques like vibrato, articulation, and improvisation."
