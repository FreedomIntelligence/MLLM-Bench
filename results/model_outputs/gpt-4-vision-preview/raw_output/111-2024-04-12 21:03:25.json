Her wide, toothy smile with the corners of her mouth turned upwards, and her eyes slightly squinted indicate a genuine expression of happiness and delight.\n\nThis conclusion is based on analyzing the specific facial features and muscle movements associated with the expression of joy or happiness. The raised cheeks, crinkled eyes, and broad smile involving the muscles around the mouth and eyes are telltale signs of a positive emotional state and feeling of enjoyment or pleasure."
