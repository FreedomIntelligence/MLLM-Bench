The top shelf provides an open space to display decorative items like the vase with greenery, while also allowing storage for items like paper bags or containers.\n\nThe two lower shelves have a rail around the edges, creating compartments that can neatly organize various household items. These shelves hold items like jars, tins, and containers of different sizes, keeping them visible and easily accessible.\n\nBeneath the shelves, there is a hanging rod with hooks, which can be used to hang and store kitchen utensils, mugs, or other frequently used items. This design maximizes the vertical space and keeps these items within easy reach.\n\nOverall, the shelving unit combines open display areas with enclosed storage compartments and hanging hooks, making it a versatile and space-efficient solution for organizing and displaying various household items in a stylish and functional manner."
