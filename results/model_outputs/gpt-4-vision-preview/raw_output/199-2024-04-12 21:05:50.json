Typically, one line represents the control line, confirming the test is working properly, while the second line indicates the detection of the virus antigen or antibodies associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\nSo in this case, with two lines visible, the interpretation would be that this particular COVID-19 rapid antigen test has yielded a positive result for the person tested."
