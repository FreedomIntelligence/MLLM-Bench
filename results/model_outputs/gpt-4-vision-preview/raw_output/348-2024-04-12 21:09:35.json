The signs they are carrying have messages such as \"End Racism\" and \"Racism is a crime against humanity.\" This suggests they are voicing an ethical demand for an end to racism and the promotion of equality and human rights for all, regardless of race or ethnicity. Their expressions and actions convey a passionate stance against the injustice of racial discrimination and prejudice. The protesters appear to be making a principled moral stand against racism as an unethical and harmful societal issue."
