The red car seems to be the source of the intense flames and smoke, with the fire engulfing the front and middle sections of the vehicle.\n\nAs for potential structural damage prior to the fire, the gray car on the left has sustained significant front-end damage, suggesting a head-on or offset frontal collision. The front bumper and hood area appear crumpled, indicating a forceful impact.\n\nThe red car, while heavily obscured by the flames, also shows signs of front-end damage, with the hood appearing deformed or pushed back, likely from the collision impact.\n\nIt's difficult to assess the full extent of pre-fire structural damage, but the visible deformation on both vehicles suggests a substantial collision occurred before the fire broke out in the red car."
