The fabric exterior is heavily soiled with what looks like dust or dirt buildup, giving it a grayish, discolored appearance. Additionally, there are visible signs of wear and fraying on the fabric material.\n\nBased on the extensive soiling and wear, it's possible this headset has seen heavy, prolonged use over an extended period without proper cleaning or maintenance. The buildup of dirt and grime could be due to factors like sweat, skin oils, or environmental exposure during frequent usage in various settings. The fraying fabric suggests the headset has endured substantial physical stress and friction, potentially from being repeatedly put on, adjusted, and taken off."
