Hermit crabs are known for their unique behavior of finding and occupying empty seashells to protect their soft, spiral-shaped abdomens. This image captures the hermit crab in its natural state, with its colorful legs and claws protruding from the white, speckled shell it has adopted as its mobile home. The relationship depicted is the hermit crab's symbiotic use of the abandoned seashell as shelter and protection."
