The screen on the left has a minimalist design with a light green background, simple icons arranged in a grid layout, and a search bar at the bottom. The icons have a flat, rounded square shape and use muted colors like green, blue, and red.\n\nIn contrast, the screen on the right has a more vibrant and colorful interface with app icons arranged in an irregular pattern against a swirling green and purple background resembling marbled paint. The icons have various shapes like circles, squares, and abstract designs, using a wider range of bright colors like red, yellow, and pink.\n\nWhile the left interface appears clean and straightforward, the right one has a more dynamic and expressive visual style. These divergent design approaches likely cater to different user preferences and brand identities of the respective operating systems or device manufacturers."
