The seal, being a marine mammal and carnivore, is likely hunting or attempting to prey upon the penguin, which is a flightless seabird.\n\nSeals are known to feed on various marine life, including fish, squid, and sometimes penguins or other seabirds. The open mouth of the seal and the close proximity to the penguin suggest a hunting or aggressive interaction.\n\nWhile penguins are generally agile swimmers, they are vulnerable to predation from larger marine predators like seals when in the water. This image captures the natural dynamic of a predator pursuing its potential prey in the marine ecosystem, highlighting the harsh realities of survival in the wild."
