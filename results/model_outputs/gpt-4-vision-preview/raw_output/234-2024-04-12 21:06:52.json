To calculate the percentage increase from 30 June 2023 to 30 Sep 2023:\n\nTotal Income on 30 Sep 2023 = Rs. 1,751.00 million\nTotal Income on 30 June 2023 = Rs. 1,552.63 million\n\nIncrease in Total Income = Rs. 1,751.00 million - Rs. 1,552.63 million = Rs. 198.37 million\n\nPercentage increase = (Increase in Total Income / Total Income on 30 June 2023) x 100\n            = (198.37 / 1,552.63) x 100\n            = 12.77%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in Total Income from the quarter ended 30 June 2023 to the quarter ended 30 Sep 2023 was approximately 12.77%."
