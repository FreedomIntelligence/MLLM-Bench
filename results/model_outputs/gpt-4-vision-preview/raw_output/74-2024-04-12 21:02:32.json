Bullfighting has a long history and cultural significance, but it is also a controversial practice due to concerns over animal welfare.\n\nThe men in the image are dressed in the iconic \"traje de luces\" or \"suit of lights\" worn by matadors and bullfighters. Their elaborate costumes with embroidered jackets and vibrant capes are an integral part of the pageantry and ritual surrounding bullfighting events.\n\nWhile bullfighting is deeply rooted in certain cultural traditions, it is also widely criticized by animal rights advocates and has been banned in several regions due to ethical concerns over the treatment of the bulls. The cultural significance and ethical debates surrounding this practice continue to be actively discussed and debated."
