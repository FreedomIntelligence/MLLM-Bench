This temperature reading indicates a low-grade fever.\n\nHaving a fever can be a sign that the body is fighting an infection or illness. My advice would be to get some rest, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, and monitor the fever. If the fever persists or worsens, or if you experience other concerning symptoms, it would be advisable to consult a medical professional for proper evaluation and treatment recommendations. Fevers can sometimes be a symptom of more serious conditions that require medical attention."
