The other figures are standing nearby, likely overseeing or assisting in the work.\n\nTheir silhouetted forms and the tools being used are characteristic of professions such as construction workers, miners, excavators, or other types of manual laborers who perform physical tasks involving digging, breaking ground, or moving earth and materials. The overall scene and positioning of the figures strongly indicate a labor-intensive outdoor worksite or construction environment."
