They have a distinctive honey-brown cap color and clustered growth pattern emerging from wood or soil.\n\nWhile some Armillaria species are edible when cooked thoroughly, Armillaria mellea is generally considered inedible or mildly toxic due to potential gastrointestinal issues if consumed raw or undercooked. It's advisable not to consume these mushrooms unless you are an expert in mushroom identification and have verified they are from an edible strain."
