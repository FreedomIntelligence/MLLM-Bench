When a glass falls from a height onto such an unyielding surface, the impact forces are maximized, increasing the chances of the glass shattering upon impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the area with the interlocking beige and white squares seems to be a soft, cushioned play mat made of foam or a similar shock-absorbing material. If a glass falls onto this padded surface from the same height, the impact forces would be significantly reduced due to the mat's ability to compress and dissipate the energy. This cushioning effect decreases the likelihood of the glass breaking upon landing.\n\nTherefore, considering the different surface properties, the glass falling on the wooden floor is at a higher risk of breaking compared to the one falling on the cushioned play mat area."
