The people are covering their faces with veils or cloths, which is a common practice in such conditions to protect themselves from the blowing sand and dust particles in the air.\n\nSandstorms or dust storms are weather phenomena that occur in arid and semi-arid regions, where strong winds pick up and carry large amounts of loose sand or dust particles from the ground. These storms can significantly reduce visibility and pose health risks if the particles are inhaled or get into the eyes.\n\nBy covering their faces with veils or cloths, the people in the image are taking precautionary measures to shield themselves from the harsh effects of the sandstorm. This practice helps prevent respiratory issues and eye irritation caused by the airborne sand and dust particles. It is a practical and necessary adaptation for those living or traveling in areas prone to such extreme weather conditions."
