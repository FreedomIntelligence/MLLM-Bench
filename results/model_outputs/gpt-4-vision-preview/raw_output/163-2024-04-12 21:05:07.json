                "content": "The topic of the speech is explaining why college entrance exams are necessary for high school students. The speaker presents three main reasons to support this viewpoint.\n\nThe rhetorical devices used in the speech include:\n\n1. Hypophora: The speaker poses a rhetorical question (\"how would you get into college?\") and then provides an answer, highlighting that family conditions and social status would likely determine admissions without entrance exams.\n\n2. Anaphora: The repetition of \"they have\" to emphasize the advantages of students from better family backgrounds.\n\n3. Antithesis: Contrasting the unfair advantages of family and money with the fairness of entrance exams that test individual effort and ability.\n\n4. Pathos: Appealing to emotions by discussing how entrance exams offer underprivileged students a chance to change their fate.\n\n5. Ethos: Using a quote from Einstein to lend authority and credibility to the argument that exams promote learning beyond just memorization.\n\n6. Metaphor: Describing the exams as \"keys to the future\" to emphasize their importance and potential to unlock opportunities.\n\n7. Concession: Acknowledging the counterargument that exams cause stress, but then refuting it by suggesting stress prepares students for future challenges.\n\nOverall, the speaker employs a range of rhetorical techniques to persuasively argue for the necessity of college entrance exams."
