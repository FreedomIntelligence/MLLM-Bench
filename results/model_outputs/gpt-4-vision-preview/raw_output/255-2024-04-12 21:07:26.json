Its facial features, such as the broad muzzle and rounded ears, are typical of tigers.\n\nThe top right cat has a more slender body and a tawny coat with no distinct markings, suggesting it is a cougar or mountain lion. Its long tail and pointed ears are also characteristic of this species.\n\nThe bottom left cat has a massive, muscular build with a thick mane around its head, identifying it as a lion. Its powerful jaws and broad face are typical features of male lions.\n\nThe bottom right cats, smaller in size, have sleek bodies and distinctive spots or rosettes on their coats, indicating they are leopards or jaguars. Their elongated bodies and flexible tails are also characteristic of these species.\n\nWhile all four depictions are of big cats, the illustrations clearly highlight the differences in their physical appearances, such as body size, coat patterns, facial structures, and other species-specific features."
