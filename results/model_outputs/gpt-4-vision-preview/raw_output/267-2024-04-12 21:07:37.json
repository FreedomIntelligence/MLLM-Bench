The person appears to be losing their balance and falling forward, which is a common occurrence when walking on slick, icy surfaces that lack traction. Other potential factors could include wearing improper footwear without sufficient grip, walking too quickly or carelessly on the icy patch, or losing footing due to an uneven or sloped surface beneath the ice layer."
