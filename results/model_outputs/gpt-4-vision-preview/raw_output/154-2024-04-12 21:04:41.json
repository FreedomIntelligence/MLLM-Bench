A line of soldiers dressed in iconic red tunics and tall bearskin hats are marching in formation, displaying the discipline and pageantry associated with this traditional military ceremony.\n\nOne soldier is carrying an ornate flag or standard, adding to the ceremonial nature of the event. The soldiers are marching with precise movements and posture, exemplifying the training and order required for such formal guard duties and rituals. The architectural backdrop of the palace and the crowds of spectators lining the area underscore this as an official state ceremony steeped in tradition."
