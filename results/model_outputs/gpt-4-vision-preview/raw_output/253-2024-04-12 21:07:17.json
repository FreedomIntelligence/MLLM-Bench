In the second image, there is text at the bottom that says \"Oxymax Playroom\" which is not present in the first image.\n\n2. In the second image, the girl's hair is slightly shorter and styled differently.\n\n3. In the first image, there is a small tree or plant decoration on top of the gingerbread house, which is missing in the second image.\n\n4. The position of the girl's left hand is slightly different between the two images.\n\n5. The shape of the gingerbread house's roof appears slightly different between the two images.\n\n6. The placement of the snowflakes in the background varies between the two images.\n\n7. The shading and highlights on the gingerbread house and the girl's face are slightly different between the two images."
