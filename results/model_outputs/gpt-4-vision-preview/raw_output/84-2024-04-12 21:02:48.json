The fish's coloration is striking, with a bright green head and upper body, transitioning to a deep blue color on the lower half and fins.\n\nThe body is laterally compressed, giving it a thin profile. It has a relatively small mouth and a yellow-tinted fin along its back. The pectoral fins are large and fan-like, which aid in its maneuverability.\n\nThe Batfish is found in tropical and subtropical waters, often near coral reefs or rocky areas. It swims in a unique upright position, using its pectoral fins to hover and navigate. This unusual swimming behavior, along with its distinctive shape and coloration, makes it easily recognizable among other reef fish species."
