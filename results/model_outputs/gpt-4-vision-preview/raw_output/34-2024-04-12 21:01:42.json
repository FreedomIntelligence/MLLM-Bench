The red color conveys energy, passion, and boldness, while the stars and swirls add a festive, celebratory feel.\n\nThis holiday or seasonal design departs from Starbucks' usual green and white color scheme, likely aiming to capture attention and create a sense of excitement around a special promotion or limited-time offering. The use of the well-recognized mermaid logo ensures brand recognition and association with Starbucks' premium coffee experience.\n\nThe bold, eye-catching colors and patterns seem geared towards appealing to a younger, trendier demographic that values novelty, limited editions, and a sense of occasion in their consumer experiences. Overall, the design effectively blends Starbucks' established brand identity with a fresh, celebratory aesthetic to drive interest and engagement among its target youth and millennial customer base."
