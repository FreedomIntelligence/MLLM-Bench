The deep, wavy grooves and ridges on the bright orange rubber outsole are designed to provide excellent traction and grip on various surfaces. This aggressive tread pattern helps the shoe maintain good grip and prevent slipping, especially during activities that involve quick movements, turns, or running on different terrain. The grooves allow the outsole to flex and disperse impact forces, enhancing cushioning and comfort for the wearer during athletic activities."
