They are bright red in color and have a distinctive hollow, cup-like shape.\n\nThe dark purple berries are blackberries. They are larger than the raspberries, have a more elongated shape, and a deep purple-black color.\n\nThe main differences are their color, size, and shape - raspberries being smaller, brighter red, and more hollow, while blackberries are larger, darker purple-black in color, and more elongated in shape."
