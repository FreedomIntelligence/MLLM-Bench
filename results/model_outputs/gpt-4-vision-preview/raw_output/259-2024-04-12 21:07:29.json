Bacon or pork belly slices: These are the strips with alternating layers of meat and white fat. Pork belly is a fatty cut, and the fat is left intact when sliced into bacon.\n\n2. Ground or minced meat: The loose, crumbly red portions appear to be ground or minced meat, likely beef or lamb. Ground meat has a higher overall fat content as the fat is distributed throughout during the grinding process.\n\n3. Lean meat cuts: The pinkish-red whole pieces, such as the sausage-like links and the flat patties, seem to be lean cuts of meat like pork or beef. These cuts have visible marbling of fat within the meat but appear leaner compared to the ground meat or bacon.\n\nIn terms of handling, the bacon slices and lean meat cuts are typically sold as intact pieces, while the ground meat is processed by grinding or mincing the meat, incorporating more fat into the mixture. The lean cuts may also undergo different preparation methods like curing or forming into patties or links before cooking."
