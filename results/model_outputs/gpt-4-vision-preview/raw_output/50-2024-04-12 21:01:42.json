The iconic wrought-iron lattice tower is typically associated with the World's Fair of 1889, also known as the Exposition Universelle, which was held to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and showcase France's industrial progress and architectural ingenuity at that time. The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel as the centerpiece and main entrance for the 1889 World's Fair."
