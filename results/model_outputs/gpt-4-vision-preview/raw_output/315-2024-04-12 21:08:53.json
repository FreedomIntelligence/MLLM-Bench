Let's combine the numerators into one fraction and the denominators into another fraction:\n\nNumerator fraction = (x + 1) / (1 - (x / (x - 1)))\nDenominator fraction = (x / (x + 1)) / (1)\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply these fractions to get a single fraction:\n\n(x + 1) / (1 - (x / (x - 1))) * (1) / (x / (x + 1))\n= (x + 1) / (x + 1 - x)\n= (x + 1) / 1\n= x + 1\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the given complex fraction is x + 1, which is a clever and concise way of representing the original expression."
