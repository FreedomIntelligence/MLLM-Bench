This will help provide context and focus for the audience.\n\n2. Consider using a more visually appealing and consistent color scheme. The current colors (teal, yellow, and red) may not be the most harmonious or easy on the eyes.\n\n3. Increase the font size and weight for better readability, especially if the slide will be presented to a larger audience or in a large room.\n\n4. Explore using more visually engaging icons or graphics instead of just text and arrows. Simple illustrations or diagrams can help convey the concepts more effectively.\n\n5. Ensure proper alignment and spacing between the elements on the slide. The current layout appears a bit unbalanced, with the \"COST\" text slightly off-center.\n\n6. Consider adding a brief explanatory sentence or bullet points to provide more context or details about the relationship between efficiency, quality, and cost being depicted.\n\n7. If possible, incorporate your company's branding elements, such as logo, fonts, and color palette, to maintain a consistent and professional look.\n\n8. Review the slide for any spelling or grammatical errors before finalizing it.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a visually appealing and easy-to-understand slide that effectively communicates the key message or concept to your audience."
