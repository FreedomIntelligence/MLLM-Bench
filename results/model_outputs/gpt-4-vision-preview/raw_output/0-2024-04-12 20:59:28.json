The bridge exhibits a distinctive steel cable-stayed design with a striking neo-Gothic architectural style.\n\nThe bridge's main span features a series of triangular trusses and arched portals that give it an ornate and intricate appearance reminiscent of Gothic cathedrals. The suspension cables are anchored to massive stone towers with decorative finials at the top. The bridge's overall design combines elements of both functionality and aesthetics, reflecting the engineering prowess and architectural artistry of its era."
