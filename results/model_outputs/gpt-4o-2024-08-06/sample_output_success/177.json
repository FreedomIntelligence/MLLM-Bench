Since the image is 4096x4096 pixels, each quadrant is approximately 2048x2048 pixels.\n\nThe spoon appears to be located in the lower center of the bottom right quadrant. You can estimate the bounding box coordinates as follows:\n\n- Top-left corner: (approximately 2700, 3100)\n- Bottom-right corner: (approximately 3200, 3400)\n\nThese are rough estimates, and you may need to adjust them based on a more precise analysis.",
