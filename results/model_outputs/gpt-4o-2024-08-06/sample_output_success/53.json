Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, it showcases an Expressionist architectural style. The design is characterized by its series of large, shell-like structures that form the roof, resembling sails of a ship or waves, which integrate beautifully with its harbor setting.\n\nThe concept behind Utzon's design was inspired by natural forms and the idea of a functional sculpture. The unique shell structures allow for a dynamic interaction with light and shadow, creating a visually striking landmark. The building's innovative use of precast concrete panels and its complex geometry were groundbreaking at the time of its construction. The Sydney Opera House is celebrated for its artistic and engineering achievements, blending form and function in a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing manner.",
