These storms are common in arid and semi-arid regions and can cause respiratory issues and eye irritation due to the fine particles in the air. Covering their faces helps reduce inhalation of dust and protects their eyes and skin.\n\n### Reasons for the Weather Occurrence:\n\n1. **Wind Patterns**: Strong winds lift loose sand and dust from the ground, creating a sandstorm. These winds can be caused by weather systems such as low-pressure areas.\n\n2. **Dry Conditions**: Arid regions with loose, dry soil are more susceptible to sandstorms. Lack of vegetation means there is nothing to hold the soil in place.\n\n3. **Temperature Changes**: Rapid heating and cooling of the desert surface can create wind, contributing to the formation of sandstorms.\n\n4. **Human Activity**: Overgrazing, deforestation, and poor land management can exacerbate the conditions that lead to sandstorms by leaving the soil exposed and vulnerable to wind erosion. \n\nThese factors combine to create the harsh conditions visible in the image.",
