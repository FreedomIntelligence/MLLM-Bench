This type of wear is common and can be caused by several factors:\n\n1. **Frequent Use**: Regular use over time can cause the material to degrade, especially if the headset is worn for extended periods.\n\n2. **Material Quality**: The outer material might be synthetic leather or another material prone to peeling, which can wear down faster than higher-quality materials.\n\n3. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to sweat, oils from the skin, or humidity can accelerate the degradation of the material.\n\n4. **Storage Conditions**: Poor storage, such as being left in direct sunlight or in a humid environment, can also contribute to wear.\n\nTo prolong the life of the headset, consider cleaning it regularly and storing it in a cool, dry place.",
