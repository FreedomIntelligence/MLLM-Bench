It implies a significant and consistent increase in global temperatures over time, particularly since the mid-20th century. This trend indicates ongoing global warming, with temperatures rising by over 1.2°C above the 1850-1900 average by 2023. The convergence of different data sets suggests a strong consensus on the warming trend.",
