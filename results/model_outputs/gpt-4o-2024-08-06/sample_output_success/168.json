However, they are closer to the living area, which might reduce privacy slightly due to potential noise.\n\n### Accessibility to Communal Areas:\n1. **Living Room**: Centrally located, making it easily accessible from all bedrooms.\n2. **Dining and Kitchen**: Positioned near the entrance, allowing convenient access for both residents and guests.\n3. **Prayer Room and Store**: Located near the entrance, providing easy access without disturbing the private areas.\n\nOverall, the design balances privacy for the bedrooms with accessibility to communal spaces, though the proximity of some bedrooms to the living area might affect noise levels.",
