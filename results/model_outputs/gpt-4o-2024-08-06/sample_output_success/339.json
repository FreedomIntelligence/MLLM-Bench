They can assess the damage and replace the screen safely.\n\n3. **Temporary Fixes**:\n   - Apply clear packing tape or a screen protector over the cracks to prevent them from spreading and to protect your fingers from sharp edges.\n\n4. **Use an External Monitor**:\n   - If the device still functions, connect it to an external monitor to continue using it while you decide on repair options.\n\n5. **Check Warranty or Insurance**:\n   - If the device is under warranty or you have insurance, check to see if screen damage is covered.\n\nAlways ensure the device is powered off before attempting any repairs or handling to avoid further damage or injury.",
