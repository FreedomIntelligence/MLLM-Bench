While the front screen isn't visible in the image, the back damage alone can affect the phone’s structural integrity and potentially impact internal components.\n\nWhether the phone is usable without repair depends on a few factors:\n\n1. **Functionality**: If the phone powers on and the touchscreen, camera, and other essential functions work, it may still be usable.\n2. **Safety**: The damaged glass poses a risk of cuts or further damage. Using a case might mitigate this risk temporarily.\n3. **Water Resistance**: The damage likely compromises any water resistance the phone had.\n\nFor long-term use, repairing the back glass is advisable to prevent further issues.",
