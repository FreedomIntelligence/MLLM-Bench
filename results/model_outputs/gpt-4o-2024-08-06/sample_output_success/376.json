Here's how you can present the data:\n\n### 1. **Stacked Bar Chart**\n- **Purpose**: To compare the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state over different Finance Commission periods.\n- **Design**:\n  - X-axis: States\n  - Y-axis: Percentage share\n  - Each bar is divided into sections representing the different Finance Commission periods (Tenth to Fifteenth).\n  - Use different colors for each period to differentiate them.\n\n### 2. **Line Graph**\n- **Purpose**: To show trends over time for selected states.\n- **Design**:\n  - X-axis: Finance Commission periods\n  - Y-axis: Percentage share\n  - Plot lines for major states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc., to show how their shares have changed over time.\n  - Use different colors for each state.\n\n### 3. **Heatmap**\n- **Purpose**: To provide a quick visual of the distribution of shares across states and periods.\n- **Design**:\n  - Rows: States\n  - Columns: Finance Commission periods\n  - Use color gradients to represent the percentage share, with darker colors indicating higher shares.\n\n### 4. **Interactive Dashboard (Optional)**\n- If presenting digitally, consider creating an interactive dashboard where users can hover over data points to see exact values and filter by state or period.\n\nThese visualizations will help convey the data clearly and allow for easy comparison across states and time periods.",
