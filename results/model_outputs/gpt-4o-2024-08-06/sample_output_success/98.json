Key elements supporting this identification include:\n\n1. **Dramatic Lighting**: The use of chiaroscuro, with stark contrasts between light and dark, enhances the drama and intensity of the scene.\n\n2. **Dynamic Composition**: The painting features a sense of movement and energy, with swirling lines and a strong diagonal orientation, typical of Baroque dynamism.\n\n3. **Emotional Intensity**: The expressions and gestures of the figures convey heightened emotion, a hallmark of Baroque art aimed at evoking an emotional response from the viewer.\n\n4. **Rich Detail and Color**: The opulent use of color and intricate details, particularly in the armor and the textures of the horse's mane, reflect the Baroque emphasis on grandeur and ornamentation.\n\nThese elements together suggest the painting belongs to the Baroque period, known for its theatricality and emphasis on movement and emotion.",
