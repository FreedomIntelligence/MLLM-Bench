The keeper's positioning and the extension suggest a good chance of making contact with the ball. However, the success of the save will depend on the speed and trajectory of the ball.\n\nIf the goalkeeper successfully tips the ball over the bar, it would result in a corner kick. The players in red and white would reposition for the set piece, with defenders marking attackers and the goalkeeper preparing for the corner.\n\nIf the save is unsuccessful and the ball goes into the net, it would result in a goal, and players would return to the center of the field for a kickoff. If the ball is parried back into play, players would scramble to either clear the ball or attempt a follow-up shot.",
