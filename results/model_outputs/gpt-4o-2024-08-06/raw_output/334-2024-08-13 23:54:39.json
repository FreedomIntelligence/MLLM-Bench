Here are some suggestions for repair:\n\n1. **Replace the Handle:**\n   - If the handle is severely damaged, consider replacing it. You can purchase a new handle from a sports store or online.\n\n2. **Use Epoxy:**\n   - For minor cracks, apply a strong epoxy adhesive to bond the broken parts. Clamp the handle tightly and let it cure for the recommended time.\n\n3. **Re-grip:**\n   - After repairing or replacing the handle, re-wrap it with a new grip for better comfort and control.\n\n4. **Consult a Professional:**\n   - If you're unsure about repairing it yourself, take it to a professional sports equipment repair shop.\n\nConsider the cost and effort of repair versus purchasing a new racquet. If the damage is extensive, a new racquet might be a better option.",
