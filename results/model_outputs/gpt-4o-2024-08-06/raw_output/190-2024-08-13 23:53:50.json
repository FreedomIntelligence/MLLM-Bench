Therefore, it is not possible to measure the crown-rump length (CRL) or determine the gestational age of a fetus from this image. The scan shows anatomical structures such as bones, muscles, and organs within the chest cavity. If you have an ultrasound image, I can help guide you on how to measure CRL and interpret it.",
