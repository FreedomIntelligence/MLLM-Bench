Here are some suggestions to improve posture:\n\n1. **Back Support**: Encourage her to sit back in the chair with her back straight and supported by the chair.\n\n2. **Table Height**: Ensure the table is at a comfortable height so her elbows are at about a 90-degree angle.\n\n3. **Feet Position**: Her feet should be flat on the ground or on a footrest to provide stability.\n\n4. **Paper Position**: The paper should be angled slightly to match the natural angle of her writing hand.\n\n5. **Lighting**: Good lighting can help reduce the need to lean in closely.\n\n6. **Regular Breaks**: Encourage her to take breaks to stretch and relax her muscles.\n\nThese adjustments can help promote better posture and reduce strain while writing.",
