In this case, the smaller bird is likely the host, feeding the larger chick, which is a young cuckoo. Cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other birds, and the host bird raises the cuckoo chick as its own, often at the expense of its biological offspring. This relationship benefits the cuckoo by allowing it to avoid the costs of rearing its young.",
