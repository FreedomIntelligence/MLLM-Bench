The hood is crumpled, and the front bumper is detached, indicating structural damage to the front frame and possibly the engine compartment.\n\nThe areas most affected by the flames are the engine compartment and the front of the vehicle. The fire is concentrated around the hood and front bumper, suggesting potential damage to the engine, electrical systems, and other components located in that area. The intensity of the flames could also lead to further structural weakening and damage to nearby parts of the vehicle.",
