It is renowned for its thousands of vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead into the wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine grounds.\n\nFushimi Inari Taisha is dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice, and has been a place of worship since before the capital moved to Kyoto in 794. Foxes (kitsune) are thought to be Inari's messengers, and many fox statues can be found at the shrine. The shrine is a popular destination for both tourists and locals, offering a unique cultural and spiritual experience.",
