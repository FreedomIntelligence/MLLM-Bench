One team calls a player from the opposite team by saying, \"Red Rover, Red Rover, let [name] come over!\" The called player then runs and tries to break through the linked hands of the opposing team. If successful, they can take a player back to their team; if not, they join the opposing team. The game continues until one team has all the players.",
