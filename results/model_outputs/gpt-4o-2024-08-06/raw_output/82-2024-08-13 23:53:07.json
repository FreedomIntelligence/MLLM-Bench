This texture suggests the use of oil paint or acrylic paint, as both can be applied in thick layers to create a three-dimensional effect. Watercolor, on the other hand, is typically more translucent and flat, lacking the heavy texture seen here. Therefore, it's likely that oil or acrylic paints were used for these paintings.",
