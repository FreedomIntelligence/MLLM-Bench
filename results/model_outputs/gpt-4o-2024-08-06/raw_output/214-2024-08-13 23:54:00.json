                "content": "The scatter plot shows a negative correlation between vaccination rate and excess deaths, with a correlation coefficient of -0.47. This indicates that as the vaccination rate increases, excess deaths tend to decrease. The p-value of 0.0004 suggests that this relationship is statistically significant. The R-squared value is 0.225, meaning that approximately 22.5% of the variability in excess deaths can be explained by the vaccination rate.\n\nThe OLS slope is -0.59, which means that for each 1% increase in the vaccination rate, excess deaths decrease by approximately 0.59.\n\nTo predict the excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, you can use the linear equation derived from the slope:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = \\text{Intercept} + (\\text{Slope} \\times \\text{Vaccination Rate}) \\]\n\nAssuming the intercept is approximately 70 (from the graph's trend line):\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 70 + (-0.59 \\times 85) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 70 - 50.15 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} \\approx 19.85 \\]\n\nSo, the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85% would be around 20.",
