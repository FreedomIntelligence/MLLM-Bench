An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, often triggered by natural events such as heavy snowfall, rapid temperature changes, or human activity. The vehicle appears to be caught or escaping from the moving snow, which can be extremely dangerous due to the force and speed of the avalanche.",
