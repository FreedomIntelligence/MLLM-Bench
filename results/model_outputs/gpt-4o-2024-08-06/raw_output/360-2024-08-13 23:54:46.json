Despite the comfort of his warm blanket, he felt uneasy. His dog, Buddy, dozed peacefully on the colorful rug beside him, blissfully unaware of Max's worries.\n\nMax had a big math test the next day, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of anxiety. He imagined himself sitting in class, struggling with the multiplication tables. As he drifted into a light sleep, his imagination took over. In his dream, the classroom transformed into a whimsical world where Buddy stood at the chalkboard, confidently solving math problems.\n\n\u201c7 x 5 = 35!\u201d Buddy announced with a wag of his tail, his voice clear and reassuring. Max watched in awe as his classmates applauded Buddy\u2019s brilliance. The dream filled Max with a sense of calm and confidence he hadn\u2019t felt before.\n\nWhen Max awoke, the morning light streamed through the window, casting a warm glow across the room. He glanced at Buddy, who was now awake and gazing at him with loyal eyes. Max smiled, feeling a surge of determination.\n\n\u201cThanks, Buddy,\u201d Max whispered, giving his furry friend a gentle pat. With renewed confidence, he got ready for school, the memory of Buddy\u2019s dream-time teaching fresh in his mind.\n\nThat day, Max approached his math test with a newfound assurance. As he filled in the answers, he remembered Buddy\u2019s dream lesson, and the numbers seemed to fall into place effortlessly.\n\nAfter school, Max returned home, his heart light with joy. He hugged Buddy tightly, grateful for the dream that turned his worries into triumph. From that day on, Max knew that with a little imagination and the support of a good friend, he could tackle any challenge that came his way.",
