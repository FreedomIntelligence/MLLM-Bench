Here's a breakdown of its functions:\n\n1. **Traction**: The grooves and rubber sections provide grip on various surfaces, reducing the risk of slipping.\n\n2. **Flexibility**: The segmented design allows the sole to flex more easily, enhancing comfort and natural foot movement.\n\n3. **Durability**: The rubber areas are placed in high-wear zones to increase the lifespan of the shoe.\n\n4. **Cushioning**: The design can help with shock absorption, providing comfort during activities like running or walking.\n\n5. **Stability**: The pattern helps distribute weight evenly, contributing to better balance and stability.",
