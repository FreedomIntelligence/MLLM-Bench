The speaker provides three reasons supporting their viewpoint: fairness, personal growth, and uniform evaluation.\n\nRhetorical codes used in the speech include:\n\n1. **Hypophora**: The speaker asks a question (\"Suppose there is no college entrance exam...\") and immediately answers it to engage the audience and clarify their point.\n\n2. **Anaphora**: The repetition of \"they have\" emphasizes the advantages of students from better backgrounds, highlighting inequality without exams.\n\n3. **Antithesis**: The contrast between family/money and personal effort (\"Your family or money doesn't help here...\") underscores the fairness of exams.\n\n4. **Pathos**: Emotional appeal through stories of students overcoming adversity, aiming to inspire and connect with the audience.\n\n5. **Ethos**: Reference to Einstein to establish credibility and highlight the broader educational benefits of exams beyond memorization.\n\n6. **Metaphor**: Describing exams as \"keys to the future\" to symbolize their role in unlocking opportunities and dreams.",
