Here\u2019s some advice for care:\n\n1. **Keep it Clean**: Wash the area gently with soap and water to prevent infection.\n2. **Protect It**: Cover the blister with a sterile bandage or blister pad to protect it from further friction.\n3. **Avoid Popping**: If possible, avoid popping the blister, as the skin can act as a natural barrier against infection.\n4. **Apply Ointment**: Use an antibiotic ointment if the blister opens to prevent infection.\n5. **Monitor for Infection**: Watch for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus. If these occur, consult a healthcare professional.\n\nIf you experience significant pain or any signs of infection, seek medical advice.",
