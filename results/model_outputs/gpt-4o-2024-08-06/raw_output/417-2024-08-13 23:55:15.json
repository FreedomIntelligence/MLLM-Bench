They are part of the gear train that transmits energy from the mainspring to the escapement.\n\n2. **Jewels:** The small, red/purple synthetic ruby bearings that reduce friction and wear on the moving parts.\n\n3. **Balance Wheel:** The wheel with a hairspring attached, located near the bottom. It oscillates back and forth, regulating the timekeeping of the watch.\n\n4. **Balance Spring (Hairspring):** The thin, coiled spring attached to the balance wheel, controlling its oscillations.\n\n5. **Escapement:** Includes the pallet fork (not directly visible) and escape wheel, which control the release of energy from the gear train to the balance wheel.\n\n6. **Bridges/Plates:** The metal plates that hold the components in place. They are screwed down and often engraved.\n\n7. **Regulator:** The component marked with \"F\" and \"S\" (Fast/Slow) for adjusting the rate of the watch.\n\n8. **Screws:** Various screws that secure the components and plates in place.\n\nThese components work together to ensure accurate timekeeping in a mechanical watch.",
