The smaller fish swim near the shark and are not attacked because they provide a service to the shark by eating parasites and cleaning its skin. In return, the pilot fish gain protection from predators by staying close to the shark and also feed on the leftovers from the shark's meals. This relationship benefits both species, as the shark remains cleaner and healthier, while the pilot fish receive food and safety.",
