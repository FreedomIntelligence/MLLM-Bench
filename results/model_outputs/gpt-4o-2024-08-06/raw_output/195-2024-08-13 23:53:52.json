This is characteristic of eczema, specifically atopic dermatitis, which is common in children. The redness and spread suggest a moderate stage of the condition, where the skin is visibly affected but not severely cracked or bleeding. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
