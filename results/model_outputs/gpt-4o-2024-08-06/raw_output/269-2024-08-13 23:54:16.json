Here are some potential causes:\n\n1. **Following Too Closely**: The driver of the rear vehicle may have been following the front vehicle too closely, reducing the ability to stop in time.\n\n2. **Distracted Driving**: The rear driver might have been distracted by a phone, passengers, or other factors, resulting in delayed reaction time.\n\n3. **Sudden Stop**: The front vehicle may have stopped suddenly, and the rear driver was unable to react quickly enough.\n\n4. **Weather Conditions**: If the road was wet or slippery, it could have contributed to the inability to stop in time.\n\n5. **Mechanical Failure**: Brake failure or other mechanical issues in the rear vehicle could have prevented it from stopping.\n\n6. **Speeding**: Excessive speed by the rear vehicle could have reduced the time available to react and stop.\n\nThe extent of damage suggests a significant impact, indicating that speed or lack of attention might have been factors.",
