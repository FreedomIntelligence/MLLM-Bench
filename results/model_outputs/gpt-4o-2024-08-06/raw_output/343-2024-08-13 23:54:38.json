Service dogs are typically exempt from \"No Dogs Allowed\" rules due to their essential role in assisting individuals with disabilities. Denying access in such cases may violate laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S. or similar legislation in other countries, which protect the rights of people with disabilities to access public spaces with their service animals.",
