The second equation is: \ud83c\udf4e + ? = 4. Since \ud83c\udf4e is 1, the missing piece should equal 3.\n3. The third equation is: ? + \ud83c\udf4c = 7. Since the missing piece from the second equation is 3, and the equation equals 7, \ud83c\udf4c should be 4.\n\nTherefore, the piece you should select to place in the second row and first column is the one with the banana (\ud83c\udf4c).",
