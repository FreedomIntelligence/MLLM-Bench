Here are some indicators:\n\n1. **Squirrel Size and Proportion**: The squirrel looks unusually large compared to the surroundings, making it seem out of proportion with the environment.\n\n2. **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting on the squirrel does not match the lighting conditions of the rest of the scene. The shadows and highlights on the squirrel do not align with the direction and intensity of the sunlight in the photo.\n\n3. **Edges and Blending**: The edges of the squirrel appear sharper and more defined than the rest of the image, suggesting it was added later. There might also be a lack of blending with the grass, making it stand out unnaturally.\n\nThese elements suggest that the squirrel was likely added to the image through editing software.",
