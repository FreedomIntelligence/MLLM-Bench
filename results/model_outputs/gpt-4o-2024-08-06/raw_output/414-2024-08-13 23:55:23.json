Prominently featured is **Ursa Major**, depicted as a large bear, which contains the famous asterism, the Big Dipper. Nearby, **Ursa Minor**, also a bear, includes Polaris, the North Star. **Draco**, the dragon, winds sinuously between them.\n\nTo the east, **Hercules** is shown as a strongman, positioned near **Lyra**, depicted as a lyre, which contains the bright star Vega. **Aquila**, the eagle, soars with Altair as its notable star. Adjacent, **Cygnus**, the swan, spreads its wings, highlighted by Deneb.\n\nIn the southern sky, **Scorpius**, the scorpion, is easily recognizable by its curved tail, with Antares shining brightly. **Sagittarius**, the archer, aims his bow, while **Capricornus** is portrayed as a sea-goat.\n\n**Gemini**, the twins, are represented by two figures, Castor and Pollux, each marked by their respective stars. **Leo**, the lion, roars with Regulus at its heart, while **Virgo**, the maiden, holds Spica.\n\nThe celestial dome also showcases **Orion**, the hunter, wielding a club and shield, with Betelgeuse and Rigel as prominent stars. **Taurus**, the bull, charges nearby, with the Pleiades cluster visible on its back.\n\nOther constellations like **Pisces** (the fish), **Aries** (the ram), **Cancer** (the crab), and **Libra** (the scales) are intricately woven into the map, each contributing to the rich tapestry of the night sky as seen by ancient astronomers.",
