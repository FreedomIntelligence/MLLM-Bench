It is located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor and was a gift from France to the United States, dedicated on October 28, 1886. Designed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue is a symbol of freedom and democracy.\n\nHistorically, the Statue of Liberty represents the friendship between the United States and France and commemorates the centennial of American independence. It has become an emblem of hope and the promise of a new life for immigrants arriving in the United States, as it was often the first sight of America for people coming through Ellis Island.\n\nSocially, the statue stands for liberty, enlightenment, and the pursuit of happiness. It is a powerful symbol of American values and ideals, such as freedom and opportunity. The torch she holds represents enlightenment, guiding the way to liberty and freedom.",
