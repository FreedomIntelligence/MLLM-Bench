The next move would be to land the trick smoothly on the skateboard.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\n1. **Landing:** The primary risk involves the landing. If not executed correctly, it could lead to falls or injuries.\n2. **Environment:** The skate park surface appears smooth, which is good for landing, but any misjudgment in speed or balance can increase risk.\n3. **Skill Level:** Assuming the skater is experienced, the risk is moderate. For a less experienced skater, the risk would be higher.\n\nSafety gear like helmets and pads can help mitigate these risks.",
