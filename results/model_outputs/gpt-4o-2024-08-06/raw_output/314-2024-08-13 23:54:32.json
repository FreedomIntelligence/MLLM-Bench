                "content": "To determine the area of the circle, we first need to find its radius. The image shows three squares inside the circle. The side lengths of the squares are 6, 4, and 2. These squares are arranged such that their combined diagonal forms the diameter of the circle.\n\nLet's calculate the length of the diameter using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. **Calculate the total diagonal:**\n\n   The diagonal of each square can be calculated using the formula for the diagonal of a square: \\( \\text{diagonal} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{side length} \\).\n\n   - For the 6x6 square: \\( \\text{diagonal} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 6 = 6\\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - For the 4x4 square: \\( \\text{diagonal} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 4 = 4\\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - For the 2x2 square: \\( \\text{diagonal} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n   Since these squares are arranged in a straight line, the total diagonal (diameter of the circle) is the sum of these diagonals:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 6\\sqrt{2} + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{2} = 12\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the radius:**\n\n   The radius \\( r \\) is half of the diameter:\n\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the circle:**\n\n   The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi (6\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\pi \\times 72 = 72\\pi\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the circle is \\( 72\\pi \\) square units.",
