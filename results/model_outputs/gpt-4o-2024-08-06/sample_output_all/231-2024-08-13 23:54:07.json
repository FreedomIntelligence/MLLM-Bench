Here's an analysis of the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita:\n\n1. **Night Light Intensity Distribution**:\n   - **US**: Higher night light intensity values (3-63) account for a larger percentage compared to Brazil and Madagascar. This suggests more developed infrastructure and economic activity.\n   - **Brazil**: The majority of areas have low light intensity (0), with a small percentage in higher intensity brackets.\n   - **Madagascar**: Almost all areas have a night light intensity of 0, indicating limited infrastructure and economic activity.\n\n2. **Average Night Light Value per Pixel**:\n   - **US**: 4.66\n   - **Brazil**: 0.63\n   - **Madagascar**: 0.02\n   - The average night light value per pixel is highest in the US, followed by Brazil, and lowest in Madagascar.\n\n3. **GDP per Capita**:\n   - **US**: $33,582\n   - **Brazil**: $3,760\n   - **Madagascar**: $249\n   - The GDP per capita is significantly higher in the US, aligning with its higher night light intensity.\n\n4. **Correlation**:\n   - There is a positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita. Countries with higher night light intensity, like the US, tend to have higher GDP per capita. Conversely, countries with lower night light intensity, like Madagascar, have lower GDP per capita.\n\n5. **Urbanization**:\n   - The urban population percentage is relatively high in the US and Brazil, which may contribute to higher night light intensity and GDP per capita. Madagascar has a lower urban percentage, aligning with its lower night light intensity and GDP.\n\nIn summary, there is a clear positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed. Higher night light intensity is associated with higher economic activity and GDP per capita.",
