Here’s an analysis based on the data:\n\n### Discrepancy Analysis\n\n1. **Reported vs. Off-Exchange Volumes:**\n   - Total off-exchange (dark pool) traded volume is 12,183,395, making up 59.06% of the total volume.\n   - Reported volumes (institutional) are 15,316,970, which is 74.24% of the total volume.\n   - A significant portion of trading is happening off-exchange, which is less transparent.\n\n2. **Short Volumes:**\n   - Total short reported volumes are 5,072,096, representing 33.12% of the reported volumes.\n   - Off-exchange short traded volumes are 3,349,471, which is 66.03% of the total reported short volumes.\n\n### Influence on Buying Pressure and Liquidity\n\n1. **Buying Pressure:**\n   - The high percentage of off-exchange trading can dilute the buying pressure seen on traditional exchanges. This is because trades in dark pools are not immediately reflected in the public order book, potentially masking true demand.\n   - The reported \"BUY PRESSURE STOLEN\" is $168.817 million, indicating a significant impact on perceived market demand.\n\n2. **Liquidity:**\n   - Off-exchange trading can impact liquidity by reducing the visible volume on public exchanges. This can lead to wider spreads and more volatile price movements, as less information is available to market participants.\n   - The high off-exchange volume suggests that a large portion of trading is not contributing to the liquidity on lit exchanges, potentially leading to less efficient price discovery.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relatively high percentage of off-exchange trading volume in AMC stock suggests potential challenges in accurately assessing market sentiment and liquidity. This can result in distorted price signals and increased volatility. Investors and traders should be aware of these dynamics when making decisions, as the true market conditions may not be fully reflected in the reported exchange data.",
