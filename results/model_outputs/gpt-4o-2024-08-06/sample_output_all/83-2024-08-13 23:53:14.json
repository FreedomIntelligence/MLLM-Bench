It appears mostly black with a gradient of colors near the base, including hints of blue and green.\n- **Head**: The head is mostly black, with a vibrant blue skin around the eye.\n- **Neck and Chest**: The neck and upper chest are bright yellow, creating a vivid contrast with the darker body.\n- **Body**: The body is predominantly black, with a distinctive reddish-orange patch on the lower belly.\n- **Feet**: The feet are grayish, adapted for gripping branches.\n- **Habitat**: Toucans are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often seen perched on tree branches.\n\nThese features make the toucan easily recognizable among birds.",
