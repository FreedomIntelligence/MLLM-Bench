The fins have a darker, almost black coloration with hints of yellow.\n\n2. **Body Shape**: The fish has an elongated, somewhat oval body shape, typical of many reef fish.\n\n3. **Fins**: The dorsal and tail fins are dark, possibly black, and appear to be rounded at the ends. The pectoral fins have a yellowish hue.\n\n4. **Mouth**: The mouth is prominent and appears to have a beak-like shape, which is characteristic of parrotfish.\n\n5. **Eyes**: The eyes are relatively large and noticeable, set towards the front of the head.\n\nThese features suggest it could be a type of parrotfish, known for their beak-like mouths and vibrant colors.",
