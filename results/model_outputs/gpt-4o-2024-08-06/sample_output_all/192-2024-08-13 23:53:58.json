The lesion appears to cause significant mass effect, with midline shift to the left.\n   - The mass is likely extra-axial, suggesting a meningioma, though other diagnoses should be considered based on clinical correlation and further imaging.\n\n2. **Hemorrhage:**\n   - There is evidence of a hyperdense area within the mass, indicative of possible hemorrhagic components.\n\n3. **Ventricular System:**\n   - The right lateral ventricle is compressed due to the mass effect.\n   - Left lateral ventricle appears mildly dilated.\n\n4. **Midline Shift:**\n   - Approximately 10 mm shift of midline structures to the left.\n\n5. **Brain Parenchyma:**\n   - No acute infarcts or other lesions identified.\n\n6. **Skull and Bone Structures:**\n   - No fractures or bony lesions noted.\n\n**Impression:**\n\n- Large right-sided extra-axial mass with features suggestive of a meningioma, causing significant mass effect and midline shift.
