Here are some observations regarding debris-clearing methods and safety gear:\n\n1. **Debris-Clearing Methods:**\n   - The area appears to be chaotic with scattered debris, indicating a lack of organized debris-clearing efforts at the moment.\n   - There are no visible heavy machinery or tools being used for clearing.\n\n2. **Safety Gear:**\n   - The person in the image is not wearing any visible protective gear such as helmets, gloves, or masks, which are essential for safety in such environments.\n   - The lack of safety gear suggests potential risks from sharp objects, unstable structures, or hazardous materials.\n\nFor improved safety and efficiency, organized debris removal and proper protective equipment for all personnel are crucial.",
