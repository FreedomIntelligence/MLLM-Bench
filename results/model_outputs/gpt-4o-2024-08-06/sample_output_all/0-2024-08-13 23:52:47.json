Its architectural style is characteristic of early 20th-century suspension bridges, featuring steel towers and cables. The bridge's design includes a series of vertical suspender cables connected to the main cables, which are supported by the steel towers. The bridge is known for its utilitarian and industrial aesthetic, with exposed steel elements and a prominent truss structure. It serves as a vital transportation link and is an iconic part of New York City's skyline.",
