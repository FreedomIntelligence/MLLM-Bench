They are dressed in traditional red uniforms with bearskin hats, adding to the formal and ceremonial atmosphere. The guards carry rifles with bayonets, and one holds a ceremonial flag, indicating a formal military event. The setting, in front of a grand building, suggests a significant location, likely of historical or governmental importance.
