The design appears to be more minimalist.\n   - **Right Phone**: The icons are uniformly rounded squares, following a consistent design language. They have a more three-dimensional appearance.\n\n2. **Color Schemes**:\n   - **Left Phone**: The background is a soft, pastel green with an illustration, giving it a calm and clean look. The icons use a variety of colors but are generally muted.\n   - **Right Phone**: The background is vibrant and colorful with a swirling pattern, giving it a dynamic and bold appearance. The icons are brightly colored, adding to the vibrant theme.\n\n3. **Layout**:\n   - **Left Phone**: The layout includes folders for organizing apps, and a few standalone icons at the bottom. The time and date are prominently displayed at the top.\n   - **Right Phone**: The layout is more grid-like, with icons evenly spaced across the screen. There is no visible folder system on this screen, and the time is smaller and located at the top.\n\nOverall, the left phone's interface leans towards a more minimalist and organized aesthetic, while the right phone's interface is vibrant and uniform.",
