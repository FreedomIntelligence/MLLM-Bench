Cubism is characterized by fragmented and abstracted forms, where objects are broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form. This particular piece exhibits several unique stylistic features typical of Cubism:\n\n1. **Geometric Shapes**: The use of geometric shapes to depict the subject, with overlapping planes and angles.\n\n2. **Multiple Perspectives**: The subject is shown from multiple viewpoints, which is a hallmark of Cubism, giving a sense of depth and complexity.\n\n3. **Bold Colors**: The use of bold, contrasting colors to emphasize different facets of the subject.\n\n4. **Distorted Forms**: The facial features and hands are distorted and exaggerated, which is common in Cubist works to break away from realistic representation.\n\nThese features suggest that the artwork is likely by Pablo Picasso, one of the pioneers of the Cubist movement. His style is easily recognizable by the fragmented and abstract representation of subjects.",
