Replace if necessary.\n\n7. **Frame**:\n   - Clean and inspect for rust or damage. Consider repainting if needed.\n\n8. **General Maintenance**:\n   - Lubricate moving parts.\n   - Adjust and tighten all components.\n\nConsider taking the bike to a local bike shop for a professional assessment to ensure it's safe to ride after the restoration.",
