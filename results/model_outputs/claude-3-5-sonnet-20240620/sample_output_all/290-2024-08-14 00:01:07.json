To restore it to working condition, you would need:\n\n1. A front wheel and tire\n2. A seat and seat post\n3. Handlebars and grips\n4. A chain\n5. Pedals (only one is visible in the image)\n6. Possibly new bearings for the wheels, bottom bracket, and headset\n7. New brake system (cables, levers, and calipers)\n\nThe frame, rear wheel, and crankset appear to be present, but they may need cleaning, lubrication, and possibly replacement depending on their condition. The fork also seems to be intact.\n\nGiven the age and condition of the bike, you might also want to consider:\n\n1. Rust treatment and repainting the frame\n2. Replacing the existing rear tire\n3. Overhauling or replacing the rear hub\n4. Checking and possibly replacing the bottom bracket\n\nBefore investing in restoration, it would be wise to thoroughly inspect the frame for any cracks or structural damage that might make it unsafe to ride. If the frame is sound, this could be an interesting restoration project, potentially resulting in a vintage BMX bike."
