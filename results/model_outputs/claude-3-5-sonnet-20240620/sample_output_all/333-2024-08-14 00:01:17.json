The damage is concentrated in the upper right corner of the device, where there are visible cracks and shattered glass. The cracks seem to extend from the corner towards the center of the phone.\n\nExtent of damage:\n- Severe cracking and shattering of the rear glass panel\n- Damage is localized to the upper right corner but extends partially across the back\n- The metal frame around the edges appears intact\n- The camera module seems unaffected\n\nUsability without repair:\nWhile the phone might still function, using it without repair is not recommended for several reasons:\n\n1. Safety: The shattered glass could lead to cuts or injuries when handling the phone.\n2. Further damage: The broken glass exposes the phone's internal components to dust, moisture, and potential further damage.\n3. Structural integrity: The damage may compromise the phone's water and dust resistance.\n4. Functionality: While not visible in this image, the damage could potentially affect internal components or the phone's overall performance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the phone might power on and perform basic functions, it would be unsafe and inadvisable to use it in this condition without repair. The extent of the damage suggests that a replacement of the rear glass panel would be necessary to restore the phone to a safe and fully functional state."
