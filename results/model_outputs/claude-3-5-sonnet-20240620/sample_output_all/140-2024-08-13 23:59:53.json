Contrast: The meme sets up a contrast between the two characters in the car. One person excitedly points out a dog, while the other expresses a dislike for dogs.\n\n2. Unexpected twist: The humor comes from the sudden appearance of a dog in the backseat, directly contradicting the second person's stated preference.\n\n3. Visual humor: The image of the grumpy-looking dog squeezed into the backseat adds to the comedic effect.\n\n4. Text overlay: The driver's exclamation \"This is the way!\" adds to the absurdity of the situation, suggesting he's pleased with this turn of events.\n\n5. Pop culture reference: The \"This is the way!\" phrase might be a nod to the popular TV series \"The Mandalorian,\" adding a layer of intertextuality.\n\nThe primary type of humor here is situational irony, where the outcome is contrary to what one would expect based on the initial setup. There's also an element of absurdism in the unexpected appearance of the dog and the driver's enthusiastic response to the situation.\n\nThe meme plays on the common experience of relationship dynamics and differing preferences, exaggerating it to a comical degree. The humor derives from the subversion of expectations and the absurd resolution to the conflict presented in the first panel."
