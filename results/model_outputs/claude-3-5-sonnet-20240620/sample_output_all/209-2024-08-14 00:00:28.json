If this is indeed a moment after someone made a shot, the basketball will fall in the next second. \n\nThe ball's position suggests it has already reached its highest point and is now in contact with the rim. Given the effects of gravity, unless there's an unusual external force acting on it, the natural next movement would be for the ball to fall downward, either through the hoop (scoring a basket) or potentially bouncing off the rim if it's not perfectly balanced.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question: assuming this is right after a shot, the basketball will fall in the next second, not rise."
