There's a white car that seems to have crashed into the road barrier on the left side of the road. The car is positioned sideways, blocking part of the road. A police vehicle is present at the scene, and there's a police officer standing in the road, likely managing traffic and the accident situation. This obstruction is causing other vehicles to slow down and create a backup, resulting in the traffic jam visible in the image."
