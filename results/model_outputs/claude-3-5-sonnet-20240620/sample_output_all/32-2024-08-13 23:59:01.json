Triangle: The symbol features a triangle made up of three curved arrows chasing each other in a clockwise direction. This is the universal symbol for recycling, representing the idea of a continuous cycle and the process of converting waste materials into reusable products.\n\n2. Number: Inside the triangle, there's a number \"2\". In the context of recycling symbols, this number indicates the type of plastic material.\n\nBelow the triangle, we can see the letters \"HDPE\", which stand for High-Density Polyethylene. This is the full name of the plastic type represented by the number 2.\n\nThe entire symbol is embossed or molded into what appears to be a plastic surface, likely on a product or packaging made from HDPE plastic.\n\nThis symbol serves to inform consumers and recycling facilities about the type of plastic used, which is crucial for proper sorting and recycling processes. HDPE is commonly used for items such as milk jugs, shampoo bottles, and some types of plastic bags."
