Pork (left side):\n- Thick slices with visible fat streaks\n- Bacon strips with alternating layers of fat and meat\n\n2. Sausages (top center):\n- Pale in color, likely pork-based\n- Encased in casings, uniform in shape\n\n3. Ham or prosciutto slices (center):\n- Thin slices with a mix of lean meat and fat\n\n4. Beef (right side):\n- Lean cuts with minimal visible fat\n- Bright red color\n- Various preparations: whole cuts, ground meat, and cubed stew meat\n\n5. Burger patties (center bottom):\n- Formed into round shapes\n- Likely made from ground beef\n\nThe fat content varies significantly:\n- Pork cuts and bacon have the highest visible fat content\n- Sausages likely contain a fair amount of fat, though it's not visible\n- Beef cuts appear leaner, with less visible fat\n\nHandling and preparation differences:\n- Some meats are sliced (pork chops, ham)\n- Others are ground (burger patties, loose ground meat)\n- Some are left as whole cuts (beef strips)\n- Sausages are processed and encased\n- Stew meat is cubed\n\nThese differences in fat content and preparation methods affect cooking times, techniques, and the overall flavor and texture of the meats when prepared."
