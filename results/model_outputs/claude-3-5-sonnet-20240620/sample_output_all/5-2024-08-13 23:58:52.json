Purpose: While a fan circulates air to cool a space, this device generates heat to warm a room.\n\n2. Heating element: The space heater has a visible heating element, shown by the orange glow in the image, which produces heat. A regular fan doesn't have this feature.\n\n3. Temperature control: The heater has a digital display and control panel on top, likely for temperature settings, which is not typical for standard fans.\n\n4. Oscillation range: The image shows a 60° oscillation range, which is designed for distributing heat. Fans typically have a wider oscillation range.\n\n5. Safety features: Space heaters often have more safety features, such as tip-over protection and overheat protection, which may not be present in regular fans.\n\n6. Remote control: This heater comes with a remote control, which is less common for standard fans.\n\n7. Design: The heater has a more enclosed design with a perforated front panel to protect users from the heating element, unlike the exposed blades of a typical fan.\n\nIn summary, while both devices manipulate air in a room, their functions, design, and features are quite different due to their distinct purposes of heating versus cooling."
