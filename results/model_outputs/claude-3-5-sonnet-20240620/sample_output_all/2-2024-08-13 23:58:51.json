These objects have several potential functions:\n\n1. Glass manipulation: Dabbers are used to shape, mold, and manipulate hot glass during the glassblowing or lampworking process.\n\n2. Applying color: They can be used to add colors or patterns to glass pieces by touching the hot glass with the colored end of the dabber.\n\n3. Creating texture: The various shapes and sizes of the dabber ends can be used to create different textures on glass surfaces.\n\n4. Marbling: Dabbers can be used to swirl colors together, creating marbled effects in glass.\n\n5. Decorative display: When not in use, these colorful and uniquely shaped tools can serve as a decorative element in an artist's studio.\n\nThe dabbers in the image come in various colors including blue, green, red, yellow, and black. They have different shapes at their ends, some appearing more rounded while others are more angular or faceted. The collection is arranged in a circular pattern, likely stored in a container or stand, with the colorful ends facing upward. The background appears to be a wooden surface, suggesting this might be on a workbench or table in a glass artist's workspace."
