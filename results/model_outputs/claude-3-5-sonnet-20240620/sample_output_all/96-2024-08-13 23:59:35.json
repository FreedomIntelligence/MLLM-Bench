Fragmented and geometric forms: The figure is composed of various geometric shapes and angular lines, breaking down the natural form into abstract elements.\n\n2. Flattened perspective: The image lacks traditional depth and perspective, presenting a more two-dimensional view of the subject.\n\n3. Bold, vibrant colors: The use of bright, contrasting colors is characteristic of later Cubist works.\n\n4. Simplified and distorted facial features: The face is depicted with exaggerated and asymmetrical features, typical of Cubist portraiture.\n\n5. Multiple viewpoints: Different angles of the face seem to be presented simultaneously, a hallmark of Cubist technique.\n\n6. Thick, visible brushstrokes: The painting technique emphasizes the materiality of the paint and the artist's hand.\n\n7. Incorporation of text: The presence of text (\"IS AWOOOOMC\") in the upper left corner is a common feature in some Cubist works.\n\n8. Framing effect: The composition is framed by bold colors, creating a picture-within-a-picture effect.\n\nThese features, particularly the bold colors, simplified forms, and the specific style of facial distortion, are reminiscent of the later works of Pablo Picasso, one of the pioneers of Cubism. The painting exhibits a playful, almost childlike quality in its execution, which is also characteristic of Picasso's style in his post-World War II period."
