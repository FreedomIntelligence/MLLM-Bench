The subway train is in motion, moving quickly through the station, which creates a blurred effect on the train and the passengers inside. This technique is often used in photography to convey a sense of speed and movement. The train appears as a streaked, elongated shape, while the stationary elements of the image (like the platform and signage) remain sharp and in focus. This contrast between the moving and stationary elements emphasizes the rapid transit nature of the subway system in Tokyo."
