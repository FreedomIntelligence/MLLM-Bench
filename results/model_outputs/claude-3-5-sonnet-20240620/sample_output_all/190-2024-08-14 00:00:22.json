The image provided is not an ultrasound of a fetus, but rather a CT (computed tomography) scan of an adult chest.\n\nThis axial (cross-sectional) CT image shows:\n\n1. The chest cavity, including both lungs\n2. The spine and ribs\n3. Soft tissues of the chest wall\n4. A notable abnormality in the left lung field, highlighted in purple, which appears to be a mass or lesion\n\nThe purple-highlighted area in the left lung is the most prominent feature, suggesting this CT was likely performed to evaluate this abnormality. It could represent a tumor, infection, or other pathological process, but without more clinical information or a radiologist's report, I cannot make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nThis image does not contain any information about a fetus or measurements that would allow for determining gestational age. For fetal measurements and gestational age determination, an obstetric ultrasound would typically be used, not a chest CT scan."
