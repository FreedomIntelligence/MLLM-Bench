In this relationship, the hermit crab benefits from using the abandoned shell of a marine snail as its protective home, while the shell itself (which came from a deceased snail) is neither helped nor harmed.\n\nHermit crabs are known for their habit of occupying empty shells of other mollusks. This behavior provides them with protection for their soft abdomens and allows them to retreat into the shell when threatened. As the crab grows, it will seek out larger shells to accommodate its increasing size.\n\nThis relationship is an excellent example of how different species in nature can be interconnected, with one species making use of the discarded structures of another for its own survival and protection. It's a fascinating demonstration of adaptation and resource utilization in the natural world."
