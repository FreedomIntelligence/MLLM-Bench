To reconstruct this road, several steps would need to be taken:\n\n1. Assessment: A thorough evaluation of the extent of the damage, including soil stability and underlying structures.\n\n2. Drainage improvement: Install proper drainage systems to prevent future water damage, as this appears to be caused by water erosion.\n\n3. Soil stabilization: The surrounding soil needs to be reinforced and compacted to provide a stable foundation.\n\n4. Fill the gap: The chasm needs to be filled with appropriate materials, likely starting with large rocks or rubble, followed by smaller gravel and soil, compacting each layer.\n\n5. Road base reconstruction: Rebuild the road base with proper materials and compaction.\n\n6. Paving: Apply new asphalt or concrete to match the existing road surface.\n\n7. Guard rails: Install guard rails or barriers along the sides of the reconstructed section for safety.\n\n8. Road markings: Repaint road markings to ensure proper traffic flow.\n\n9. Environmental considerations: Implement erosion control measures and replant vegetation where necessary to prevent future erosion.\n\nThis reconstruction process would require heavy machinery, skilled workers, and careful engineering to ensure the new road section is stable and can withstand future weather events. The work would also need to be coordinated with local authorities to manage traffic and ensure safety during the reconstruction process."
