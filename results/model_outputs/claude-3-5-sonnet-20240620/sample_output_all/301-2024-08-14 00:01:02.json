The first row establishes that apple + apple = 2, so each apple has a value of 1.\n2. The second row already has an apple and equals 4, so the missing piece must be 3 to make the equation work (1 + 3 = 4).\n\nTherefore, the apple piece should be placed in the second row, first column to complete that equation correctly.\n\nAs for the arithmetic question in the image: (1 apple + 3 bananas) × 2 strawberries = ?\n\nWe can solve this using the values we've deduced from the puzzle:\n- 1 apple = 1\n- 1 banana = 2 (because apple + banana + banana = 7, so 1 + 2 + 2 = 7)\n- 1 strawberry = 3 (because strawberry + banana + banana = 7, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7)\n\nNow we can calculate:\n(1 + 3 × 2) × 2 × 3 = (1 + 6) × 6 = 7 × 6 = 42\n\nTherefore, the answer to the arithmetic question is 42."
