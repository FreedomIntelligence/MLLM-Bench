Gears (Wheels): Multiple brass-colored gears of various sizes are visible throughout the mechanism.\n\n2. Jewels: Small red and purple dots visible in several places are jewel bearings, used to reduce friction.\n\n3. Plates: The silver-colored metal forming the base and structure of the movement.\n\n4. Bridge: The shaped metal pieces that hold various components in place.\n\n5. Balance wheel: The circular component visible at the bottom, used for timekeeping regulation.\n\n6. Hairspring: The thin spiral spring attached to the balance wheel.\n\n7. Escape wheel: A star-shaped gear, part of the escapement mechanism.\n\n8. Mainspring barrel: The large circular component, typically housing the mainspring.\n\n9. Screws: Multiple small screws are visible, holding various parts together.\n\n10. Lever: Part of the escapement mechanism, usually near the balance wheel.\n\n11. Regulator: The component with markings (S and F) near the balance wheel, used for fine-tuning.\n\n12. Winding stem: The protruding piece on the right side of the movement.\n\n13. Ratchet wheel: A gear with angled teeth, often part of the winding mechanism.\n\nThis movement appears to be from a chronograph watch, given its complexity and number of components. The level of detail and finishing suggests it's a high-quality movement."
