The largest square has sides of length 6. The diagonal of this square forms the diameter of the circle. We can calculate the length of this diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n   Diagonal² = 6² + 6² = 36 + 36 = 72\n   Diagonal = √72 = 6√2\n\n   The radius is half of this diagonal:\n   Radius = (6√2) / 2 = 3√2\n\n2. Calculating the area:\n   Now that we have the radius, we can use the formula A = πr²\n\n   A = π(3√2)²\n   A = π(18)\n   A = 18π\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is 18π square units.\n\nTo get a numerical approximation, we can use π ≈ 3.14159:\n18π ≈ 18 * 3.14159 ≈ 56.55 square units\n\nSo the exact area is 18π square units, or approximately 56.55 square units."
