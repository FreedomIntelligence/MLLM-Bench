Scissors (which you already have)\n2. Needle and thread in a color matching your pants\n3. Fabric patches or scraps in complementary colors or patterns\n4. Embroidery floss in various colors\n5. Embroidery hoop\n6. Iron-on patches (optional)\n7. Fabric glue (optional)\n8. Decorative buttons or beads (optional)\n\nFor a fashionable repair, you could consider:\n\n1. Visible mending: Use contrasting thread colors to create decorative stitches around the holes.\n2. Patch art: Apply colorful fabric patches behind the holes and secure them with decorative stitching.\n3. Embroidery: Create small embroidered designs around the holes to turn them into intentional decorative elements.\n4. Appliqué: Cut fabric into interesting shapes and sew them over the holes for a unique look.\n5.
