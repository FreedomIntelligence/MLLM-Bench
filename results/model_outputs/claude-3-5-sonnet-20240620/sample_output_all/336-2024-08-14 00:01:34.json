There is extensive cracking and displacement of the pavement, with large sections broken apart and shifted. The damage extends across a wide area, creating a hazardous landscape.\n\nTo repair this level of damage:\n\n1. Assess stability: Geotechnical engineers should evaluate the underlying soil and rock structure to ensure no further movement is likely.\n\n2. Remove debris: Clear all broken pavement and unstable material from the area.\n\n3. Stabilize the ground: This may involve techniques like soil nailing, retaining walls, or other slope stabilization methods depending on the cause and extent of the damage.\n\n4. Rebuild foundation: Lay a new, reinforced foundation that can better withstand future ground movements.\n\n5. Repave: Apply new asphalt or concrete surfacing, ensuring proper drainage systems are in place.\n\n6. Install monitoring systems: Set up sensors to detect any future ground movement and provide early warnings.\n\n7. Consider rerouting: If the area proves too unstable, it may be necessary to reroute the road entirely.\n\nThis type of repair would be a major undertaking, requiring significant time, resources, and expertise to ensure a safe and lasting solution. The exact approach would depend on a thorough geological and engineering assessment of the site."
