Color Scheme:\n   - Background: Black\n   - Main button colors: Dark gray for most buttons\n   - Accent color: Orange for operation buttons on the right\n   - Text color: White for all buttons\n\n2. Layout:\n   - Grid layout with 5 rows and 10 columns\n   - Buttons are pill-shaped (rounded rectangles)\n   - Most buttons are equal in size, with some exceptions:\n     - The \"0\" button spans two columns\n     - The operation buttons on the right are slightly larger\n\n3. Typography:\n   - Use a sans-serif font for all text\n   - Varying text sizes, with larger text for numbers and basic operations\n\n4. Features:\n   - Scientific calculator functionality\n   - Display area at the top (showing \"750\" in the image)\n\n5. Button Types:\n   - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)\n   - Numbers 0-9 and decimal point\n   - Advanced mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.)\n   - Memory functions (mc, m+, m-, mr)\n   - Constants (e, π)\n   - Other functions (%, ±, EE, Rand)\n\nTo implement this UI, I would recommend using a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter for mobile development, or a web framework like React or Vue.js for web applications. This would allow for easy implementation of the grid layout and consistent styling across different devices.\n\nFor the functionality, I would implement a calculator logic that can handle both basic and scientific operations, ensuring that the UI is not only visually appealing but also fully functional as a scientific calculator."
