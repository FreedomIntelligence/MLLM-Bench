This method is characteristic of certain fishing communities, particularly in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe primary tool used is a large conical fishing net. This net is held aloft and is designed to be lowered into the water to catch fish.\n\nBased on the aquatic environment (a large body of water, likely a lake), the specialized boat, the distinctive leg-rowing technique, and the prominent fishing net, we can infer that the profession of this individual is that of a traditional fisherman. More specifically, this appears to be an Intha fisherman from Inle Lake in Myanmar (Burma), known for their unique leg-rowing fishing technique and use of these distinctive conical nets."
