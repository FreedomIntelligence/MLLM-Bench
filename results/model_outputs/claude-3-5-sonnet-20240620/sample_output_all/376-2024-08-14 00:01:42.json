Stacked Area Chart:\n   This would be the primary visualization, showing the share of taxes for each state over time. The x-axis would represent the six Finance Commission periods, and the y-axis would show the percentage share. Each state would be represented by a different colored area, stacked on top of each other. This would allow for easy comparison of states' shares over time and how they relate to each other.\n\n2. Small Multiples Line Charts:\n   Create a grid of small line charts, one for each state. This would allow for a detailed view of how each state's share has changed over time, making it easy to spot trends for individual states.\n\n3. Heatmap:\n   Convert the table into a heatmap, with states on the y-axis and Finance Commission periods on the x-axis. Color intensity would represent the percentage share, allowing for quick identification of high and low values across states and time periods.\n\n4. Grouped Bar Chart:\n   For the top 5-10 states (by average share), create a grouped bar chart. Each group would represent a state, with six bars showing the share for each Finance Commission period. This would allow for easy comparison of the largest contributors over time.\n\n5. Treemap:\n   Create a treemap for each Finance Commission period, with the size of each rectangle representing the state's share. This would provide a quick visual of how the shares are distributed among states at any given time period.\n\n6. Interactive Dashboard:\n   Combine these visualizations into an interactive dashboard where users can switch between different views, filter states, or zoom in on specific time periods.\n\nThese visualizations would help to highlight trends, compare states, and show the overall distribution of tax shares over time, making the data more accessible and easier to interpret than the raw table."
