Its surface appears even and glossy, with a slight sheen visible in the lighting. There are very subtle variations in color and tiny imperfections that give it a natural look, but overall the texture is uniform and sleek.\n\n2. Orange (orange fruit on the right):\nIn contrast, the orange has a much more textured skin. Its surface is visibly dimpled and pitted, giving it a rough appearance. This texture is often described as \"pebbled\" or \"bumpy.\" The skin has a matte finish rather than a glossy one, and the multitude of tiny indentations create a complex pattern of light and shadow across its surface.\n\nThe difference in texture between these two fruits is quite stark. While the apple's skin appears almost polished and flat, the orange's skin is notably irregular and rough to the eye. This textural contrast is one of the key visual differences between these two types of fruit, alongside their distinct colors and shapes."
