A collectible item, especially given the unusual choice of a coelacanth\n4. A conversation piece, as coelacanths are not commonly known fish and might spark interest or discussion\n\nGiven the context of the image, which includes music-related posters and fan merchandise, this coelacanth plush might also be related to a band, artist, or some form of pop culture reference that uses this prehistoric fish as a symbol or mascot."
