The bedrooms are well-positioned for privacy, as they are located away from the main living areas.\n2. The master bedroom is separated from the other two bedrooms, providing additional privacy.\n3. Each bedroom has its own dedicated bathroom, which enhances privacy for the occupants.\n4. The bedrooms are not directly accessible from the main entrance, which adds an extra layer of privacy.\n\nAccessibility to Communal Areas:\n1. The living room is centrally located, making it easily accessible from all bedrooms and other areas of the house.\n2. The kitchen and dining area are open to each other and adjacent to the living room, creating a fluid and accessible communal space.\n3. The prayer room is conveniently located near the living area, making it easily accessible for all household members.\n4. The store room is placed near the kitchen, which is practical for accessing household supplies.\n\nOverall, the floor plan demonstrates a good balance between privacy for personal spaces and accessibility to communal areas. The bedrooms are tucked away from the main living spaces, while the central positioning of the living room, kitchen, and dining area promotes easy interaction and movement between these shared spaces."
