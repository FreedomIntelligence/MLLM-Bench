RBC (Red Blood Cells) is low at 4.33, below the normal range of 4.6-10.\n2. ALB (Albumin) is low at 16.2, below the normal range of 18.0-36.0.\n3. TB (Total Bilirubin) is high at 1.5, above the normal range of 0.0-15.0.\n4. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is elevated at 83, above the normal range of 0-48.\n5. ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) is elevated at 30, above the normal range of 5-130.\n6. AMY (Amylase) is low at 390, below the normal range of 600-1000.\n7. Crea (Creatinine) is high at 31.7, above the normal range of 7.0-27.0.\n8. CK (Creatine Kinase) is elevated at 1320, above the normal range of 0.0-1.13.\n\nGiven these abnormalities, a possible diagnosis could be liver dysfunction or liver disease, potentially accompanied by kidney issues. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), increased total bilirubin, and low albumin suggest liver problems. The high creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction. The extremely high CK level could suggest muscle damage or breakdown.\n\nIt's important to note that this interpretation is based solely on the lab results provided and a comprehensive diagnosis would require a full clinical evaluation, including patient history, physical examination, and potentially further tests. The patient should consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
