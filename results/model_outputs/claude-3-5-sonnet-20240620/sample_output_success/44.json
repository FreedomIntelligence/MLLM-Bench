Raspberries are distinctively red, have a hollow center, and are made up of many small individual sections called drupelets, which give them their characteristic bumpy texture.\n\nThe dark purple berry in the bowl is a blackberry. Blackberries differ from raspberries in several ways:\n\n1. Color: Blackberries are dark purple to almost black, while raspberries are red.\n\n2. Shape: Blackberries are more elongated and oval-shaped compared to the rounder raspberries.\n\n3. Texture: While both have a bumpy surface, blackberries tend to have larger individual drupelets.\n\n4. Taste: Blackberries are generally sweeter and less tart than raspberries.\n\n5. Core: When picked, blackberries retain their white core, while raspberries are hollow.\n\nBoth berries are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, making them excellent additions to a healthy diet. In the image, you can see both types of berries in the smoothie bowl, along with other fruits like mango, strawberries, and blueberries, creating a colorful and nutritious meal."
