The pattern is composed of various stylized flowers and leaves in a repeating design.\n\nThe flowers come in several shapes and colors:\n- Large, multi-petaled blooms in red and orange tones with light blue centers\n- Smaller star-shaped flowers in bright red\n- Delicate white and yellow flowers with red accents\n- Pale yellow flowers with multiple layers of petals\n\nThe foliage includes:\n- Various shades of green leaves, from light mint to deeper forest green\n- Some leaves have a more rounded shape while others are more pointed or lobed\n\nThe overall composition creates a lush, tropical feel with its warm colors and abundant plant life. The style appears to be a modern take on traditional floral patterns, with a slightly abstract quality to the flower and leaf shapes. The arrangement of elements gives a sense of movement and flow across the surface.\n\nThis type of pattern would be suitable for fabric, wallpaper, or other decorative applications where a bold, nature-inspired design is desired."
