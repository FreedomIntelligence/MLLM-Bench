They have the characteristic bell-shaped or conical caps and thin stems typical of Mycena species. The mushrooms are growing in a cluster on what looks like decaying wood or bark, surrounded by moss and other forest floor vegetation.\n\nRegarding edibility, Mycena mushrooms are generally considered inedible. While they're not known to be highly toxic, most species in this genus are too small and fragile to be of culinary interest. Additionally, some Mycena species can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.\n\nIt's important to note that accurate mushroom identification often requires more than just a photograph. Factors like spore print, habitat, and microscopic features are often necessary for definitive identification. Therefore, it's always best to consult with an expert mycologist before considering any wild mushroom for consumption.\n\nAs a general rule, it's safest to admire wild mushrooms for their beauty and ecological role rather than considering them as a food source unless you have expert knowledge in mushroom identification."
