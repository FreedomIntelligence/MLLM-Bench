This temperature is considered normal body temperature for most adults.\n\nGiven this reading, here's some advice:\n\n1. The temperature indicates no fever, so there's likely no immediate cause for concern regarding illness.\n\n2. Continue to monitor temperature if there are any other symptoms of illness, as body temperature can fluctuate throughout the day.\n\n3. Maintain good hygiene practices, such as regular hand washing, to prevent potential infections.\n\n4. Stay hydrated and get adequate rest to support overall health and maintain normal body functions.\n\n5. If there were concerns about fever or illness that prompted taking the temperature, but other symptoms persist despite the normal reading, consider consulting a healthcare professional for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n6. Remember that \"normal\" body temperature can vary slightly from person to person and at different times of the day. What's most important is to be aware of what's normal for you personally.\n\n7. Keep the thermometer clean and stored properly for future use."
