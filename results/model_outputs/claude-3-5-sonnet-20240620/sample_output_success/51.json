It's not a single building, but rather a series of fortifications and walls that stretch across the northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China.\n\nThe construction of the Great Wall can be traced back to various periods in Chinese history, with different sections built and rebuilt over many centuries. The earliest construction began during the 7th century BCE. However, the most well-known and best-preserved sections of the wall, like the one shown in this image, were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE).\n\nThe image shows a section of the wall snaking across mountainous terrain, with its iconic watchtowers and steps. The wall is surrounded by autumn foliage, creating a beautiful contrast between the stone structure and the colorful landscape. This particular view is likely of a restored section that's popular with tourists, as evidenced by the people visible walking along the wall.\n\nWhile the Great Wall's construction spans over 2,000 years, the majority of what remains visible today dates from the Ming Dynasty period, making it around 500-600 years old."
