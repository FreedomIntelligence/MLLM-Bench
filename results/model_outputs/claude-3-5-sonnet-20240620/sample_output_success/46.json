It's a cylindrical roll wrapped in what looks like a thin, translucent rice paper or cabbage leaf. The roll is placed on a white plate and is covered with a brown sauce or glaze. On top of the roll, there's a sprinkle of what seems to be chopped peanuts or another type of crushed nut. The sauce also pools around the roll on the plate. This dish is likely an Asian-inspired appetizer or main course, possibly a fresh spring roll or a similar wrapped dish served with a savory sauce."
