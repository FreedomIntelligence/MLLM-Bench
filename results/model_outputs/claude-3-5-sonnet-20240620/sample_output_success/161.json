Multilingual accessibility: It addresses the need for AI language models that can perform well across various languages, not just dominant ones like English and Chinese.\n\n2. Focus on under-resourced languages: The model excels in languages with limited resources, including both Latin and non-Latin scripts, which is crucial for global inclusivity in AI technology.\n\n3. Democratization of AI: By making their model open-source and freely available, the researchers are working to make advanced language AI more accessible to people worldwide.\n\n4. Overcoming restrictions: The work aims to provide access to ChatGPT-like capabilities in countries where OpenAI's services might be restricted due to government regulations or other factors.\n\n5. Competitive performance: The model achieves performance comparable to existing open-source models in major languages while also performing well in less-resourced languages.\n\n6. Open collaboration: By releasing their data, code, and models publicly, the researchers are encouraging further development and improvement of multilingual AI models by the global research community.\n\nThis research represents a significant step towards making advanced language AI more inclusive and accessible on a global scale, potentially bridging linguistic divides in AI technology access and capabilities."
