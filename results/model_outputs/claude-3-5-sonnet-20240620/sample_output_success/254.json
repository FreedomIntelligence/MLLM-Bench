Fishing rod: In the left image, the penguin's fishing rod has no bait or fish on it. In the right image, there's a small red fish on the fishing line.\n\n2. Penguin's feet: The left penguin has three orange toes on each foot. The right penguin has one yellow toe on its visible foot.\n\n3. Ice/snow: The ice or snow formation in the background on the left is slightly taller and more pointed than the one on the right.\n\n4. Water: The waves in the water on the left image are more pronounced and numerous compared to the right image.\n\n5. Cloud: There's a small cloud in the upper left corner of the left image that is missing in the right image.\n\nThese are the five differences I've identified between the two penguin images."
