It's a rapid antigen test, as indicated by the \"COVID-19 Ag\" label on the device.\n\nRegarding the two lines on the test kit:\n\n1. The top line, marked with a \"C\" (which stands for \"Control\"), shows a pink/red line. This indicates that the test is working properly and the result is valid.\n\n2. The bottom line, marked with an \"S\" (which stands for \"Sample\" or \"Test\"), does not show any visible line.\n\nThe interpretation of these results is that this is a negative test for COVID-19. A single line at the \"C\" marker typically indicates a negative result, meaning the test did not detect COVID-19 antigens in the sample. If there were two lines (both at \"C\" and \"S\"), it would indicate a positive result.\n\nIt's important to note that while these rapid tests are useful, they are not 100% accurate and results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical information and more sensitive tests if necessary."
