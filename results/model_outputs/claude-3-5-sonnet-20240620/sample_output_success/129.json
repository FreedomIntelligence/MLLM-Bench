Eyes: The character's eyes are narrowed and angled downwards, creating a strong furrowed brow effect. The pupils are small and focused, indicating intense concentration or anger.\n\n2. Mouth: The mouth is drawn into a tight, teeth-baring grimace. The teeth are clearly visible and clenched, suggesting extreme tension or aggression.\n\n3. Overall facial expression: The combination of the narrowed eyes and grimacing mouth creates a classic expression of intense anger or rage.\n\n4. Color: The character's bright red color further emphasizes the intensity of the emotion, as red is often associated with anger and strong emotions.\n\n5. Body language: Although we can only see the upper body, the character appears tense and rigid, which aligns with the severe facial expression.\n\n6. Contrast: The severe expression is made more striking by the contrast with the formal office attire (shirt, tie, and belt), suggesting a barely contained emotional state in a professional setting.\n\nThe exaggerated features of this animated character are designed to convey a very strong, almost comical level of anger or frustration, pushing the emotion to its extreme. This makes the intensity of the emotion unmistakably severe."
