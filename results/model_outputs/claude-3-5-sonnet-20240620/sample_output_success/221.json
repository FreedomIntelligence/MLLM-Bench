In this relationship:\n\n1. The pilot fish benefit from the association with the shark by:\n   - Feeding on parasites on the shark's body, helping to keep the shark clean\n   - Eating leftover scraps from the shark's meals\n   - Gaining protection from other predators by staying close to the much larger shark\n\n2. The shark is generally unaffected by the presence of the pilot fish. It neither benefits significantly nor suffers any harm from their presence.\n\nThe pilot fish are not attacked by the shark for several reasons:\n1. They are too small to be considered a worthwhile meal for the shark.\n2. The shark has evolved to recognize these fish as non-threatening and potentially beneficial.\n3. The pilot fish are quick and agile, making them difficult targets even if the shark were interested.\n\nThis relationship is categorized as commensalism because one species (the pilot fish) benefits while the other (the shark) is neither helped nor harmed to any significant degree. It's a remarkable example of how different species can coexist and even cooperate in the complex web of marine life."
