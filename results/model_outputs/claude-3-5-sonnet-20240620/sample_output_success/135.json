In this activity, several children are sitting in a circle while one child stands and walks around the outside, tapping or touching the heads of the seated children.\n\nThe basic rule of \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" is that the standing child taps each seated child's head, saying \"duck\" until they choose one child to be the \"goose.\" When they do this, the chosen child must get up and chase the tapper around the circle. If the tapper makes it back to the empty spot without being caught, they sit down and the chaser becomes the new tapper. If caught, the original tapper must go again.\n\nThis type of game encourages physical activity, quick reflexes, and social interaction among children. It's a popular choice for group play in schools, parks, or other recreational settings."
