Given that the average height of adult men is typically around 5'9\" to 5'10\" (175-178 cm), and these men seem to be quite tall, possibly athletes, they could be 6'3\" (190 cm) or taller.\n\nThe woman's head reaches approximately to the chest level of the men. Considering this proportion, we can estimate that she is likely around 5'2\" to 5'4\" (157-163 cm) tall. This would put her at a height that's noticeably shorter than average male height, but within a typical range for adult women.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the visual information provided in the image, and without precise measurements or known reference points, it's impossible to determine her exact height."
