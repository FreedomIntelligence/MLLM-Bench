Cotton fibers have a structure that allows them to absorb and hold water molecules effectively. \n\nBamboo towels, while also absorbent, are often less so than cotton when the towels are new. Bamboo fabric is known for its moisture-wicking properties, which means it can pull moisture away quickly, but it may not hold as much water initially as cotton.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that bamboo towels often become more absorbent over time and with repeated washing, while maintaining their softness. Cotton towels, on the other hand, may lose some of their absorbency over time if not cared for properly.\n\nThe image shows stacks of both cotton (gray) and bamboo (white) towels, but doesn't provide information about their relative absorbency. The answer is based on general material properties rather than specifics shown in the picture."
