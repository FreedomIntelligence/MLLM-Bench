Key features of its architectural style visible in the image include:\n\n1. The distinctive steel towers that rise above the roadway, forming the bridge's main support structure.\n\n2. The large cables that sweep down from the towers, creating the bridge's characteristic silhouette.\n\n3. The vertical suspender cables that connect the main cables to the bridge deck.\n\n4. The intricate lattice-work of steel that forms the bridge's structural support, visible beneath the roadway.\n\nThe bridge's design combines both form and function, with its grand scale and elegant lines making it not just a practical river crossing but also a monumental piece of urban architecture. Its presence in this street scene creates a striking contrast between the historic, early 20th-century engineering of the bridge and the more modern urban landscape of buildings, cars, and city life in the foreground."
