The visual symptoms include:\n\n1. Redness: There are noticeable areas of redness on the cheeks and around the mouth.\n2. Raised bumps: The affected areas show slightly raised, inflamed patches.\n3. Dry skin: The skin appears dry and potentially flaky in the affected areas.\n4. Distribution: The symptoms are primarily concentrated on the face, particularly the cheeks and around the mouth, which is a common pattern for eczema in young children.\n\nBased on the visible symptoms, this appears to be a moderate stage of atopic dermatitis. The reasons for this assessment are:\n\n1. The affected areas are clearly defined and noticeable, but do not cover the entire face.\n2. The redness is pronounced but not severe or extremely inflamed.\n3. There are no visible signs of bleeding, cracking, or oozing, which would indicate a more severe stage.\n4. The child's skin condition, while obviously irritated, does not appear to be causing extreme distress.\n\nIt's important to note that proper diagnosis and staging of atopic dermatitis should be done by a medical professional, as they can assess other factors not visible in a single image, such as the duration of symptoms, the child's overall health, and any other affected areas of the body."
