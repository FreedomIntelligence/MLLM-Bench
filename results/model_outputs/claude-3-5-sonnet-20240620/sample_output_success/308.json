This outfit features a thick, fur-lined coat with long sleeves. The coat appears to be made of a heavy material, possibly leather or a similar sturdy fabric, with a fur or fleece lining visible at the collar and cuffs. This type of coat is designed for cold weather and would provide significant insulation against the cold.\n\nThe other outfits shown are less suitable for such cold temperatures:\n\n1. The left outfit is a form-fitting, long-sleeved dress that appears to be made of a thin, possibly sequined material. While it covers the arms, it doesn't seem to offer much insulation.\n\n2. The middle outfit consists of a black turtleneck top and loose pants. While the turtleneck might provide some warmth for the neck, the overall outfit doesn't appear to be thick enough for very cold temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the fur-lined coat on the right would be the best choice for warmth in -5°C weather among the options presented in the image."
