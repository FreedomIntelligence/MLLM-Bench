The Flatiron Building is one of New York's most recognizable and photographed landmarks. \n\nBuilt in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at the time and is considered a groundbreaking skyscraper. Its steel-frame structure and Beaux-Arts style facade with limestone and glazed terra-cotta cladding are notable architectural features.\n\nThe building's narrow wedge shape was designed to fit the triangular plot at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway. This unusual form creates a striking visual effect, especially when viewed from the narrow end, as shown in this image. The perspective emphasizes the building's height and its sharp, prow-like edge.\n\nThe Flatiron Building is not just architecturally significant but has also become an enduring symbol of New York City, featured in countless photographs, films, and artworks over the years."
