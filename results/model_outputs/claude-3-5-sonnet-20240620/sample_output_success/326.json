However, if the photographer wants to improve the overall image quality while maintaining this creative effect, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Use a slightly faster shutter speed: This would help maintain some motion blur while allowing more details to be visible in the main subject and background.\n\n2. Employ panning technique: Following the moving subject with the camera during exposure can keep the main subject sharper while blurring the background, enhancing the sense of motion.\n\n3. Increase the aperture: A smaller aperture (higher f-number) can increase the depth of field, potentially bringing more of the scene into focus.\n\n4. Stabilize the camera: Using a tripod or image stabilization can help keep stationary elements sharper, creating a stronger contrast with the blurred moving elements.\n\n5. Experiment with different focal lengths: A longer focal length can compress the scene and potentially create a more dramatic effect with the motion blur.\n\n6. Consider post-processing: Selective sharpening in post-production could enhance certain areas of the image while maintaining the overall motion effect.\n\nRemember, the current image has its own artistic merit, and these suggestions are only if the photographer wishes to adjust the balance between motion blur and image clarity."
