United States:\n   - Highest GDP per capita: $33,582\n   - Highest average value per pixel for night light intensity: 4.66\n   - Lowest percentage of areas with no light (0 intensity): 69.32%\n   - Highest percentages in higher light intensity categories\n\n2. Brazil:\n   - Middle GDP per capita: $3,760\n   - Middle average value per pixel for night light intensity: 0.63\n   - Middle percentage of areas with no light: 94.02%\n   - Middle percentages in higher light intensity categories\n\n3. Madagascar:\n   - Lowest GDP per capita: $249\n   - Lowest average value per pixel for night light intensity: 0.02\n   - Highest percentage of areas with no light: 99.73%\n   - Lowest percentages in higher light intensity categories\n\nThe correlation is evident in several ways:\n\n1. As GDP per capita increases, the average value per pixel of night light intensity increases.\n2. Countries with higher GDP per capita have a lower percentage of areas with no light (0 intensity).\n3. Higher GDP per capita correlates with higher percentages in the more intense light categories (3-5, 6-10, 11-20, 21-62, 63).\n\nThis correlation suggests that economic development, as measured by GDP per capita, is associated with greater urbanization and infrastructure development, which in turn leads to more widespread and intense night lighting.\n\nIt's worth noting that other factors like urban population percentage and population density don't show as clear a correlation with night light intensity. For instance, Brazil has the highest urban population percentage (81%) but middle values for night light intensity and GDP per capita.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates how night light intensity can be a useful proxy for economic development, especially when comparing countries with significantly different levels of economic output."
