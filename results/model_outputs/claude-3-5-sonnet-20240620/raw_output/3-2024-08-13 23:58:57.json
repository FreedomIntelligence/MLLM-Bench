These robots are designed to autonomously clean large floor areas in warehouses, factories, supermarkets, or other spacious facilities. They can navigate around obstacles (like the wooden pallets visible in the image) and efficiently clean floors without constant human supervision.\n\nThis type of device helps to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in large spaces while potentially reducing labor costs and increasing cleaning consistency. It's particularly useful in environments that require frequent or continuous cleaning, such as 24/7 operational facilities or areas with high foot traffic or debris accumulation."
