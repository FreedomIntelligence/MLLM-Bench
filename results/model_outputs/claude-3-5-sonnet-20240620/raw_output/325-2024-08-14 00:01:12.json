Use a tripod: This would allow for longer exposure times without introducing camera shake, resulting in a sharper image with less noise.\n\n2. Lower the ISO: A lower ISO setting would reduce the grainy appearance in the darker areas of the image.\n\n3. Adjust the aperture: A wider aperture (lower f-number) would allow more light in, potentially allowing for a lower ISO or faster shutter speed.\n\n4. Longer exposure time: This would capture more light and detail, especially in the darker areas of the image.\n\n5. Use manual focus: Ensure the focus is sharp, especially on the main subjects like the lit-up house and tree.\n\n6. Bracket exposures: Take multiple shots at different exposures and combine them in post-processing for better dynamic range.\n\n7. Post-processing: Adjust contrast, shadows, and highlights in editing software to bring out more detail in both dark and bright areas.\n\n8. Use a wider lens: This could capture more of the scene and potentially allow for more interesting compositions.\n\n9. Consider adding some foreground interest: This could add depth to the image.\n\n10. Experiment with white balance: Adjusting the white balance could enhance the warm glow of the decorative lights.\n\nThese techniques could help to create a clearer, more detailed, and more visually appealing nighttime street scene."
