An iPad (partially visible beneath the AV Access device)\n\nThe AV Access device has several sockets and ports, which I'll identify and describe their functionality:\n\n1. Two USB ports: These are likely USB-A ports for connecting peripherals, storage devices, or other USB-compatible devices.\n\n2. One USB-C port: This could be used for faster data transfer, video output, or power delivery.\n\n3. 3.5mm audio jack: For connecting headphones or external speakers.\n\n4. SD card slot: For reading SD memory cards, often used in cameras and other devices.\n\n5. Power button: A circular button on the right side, likely for turning the device on and off.\n\n6. LED indicators: Small lights above the ports, probably indicating power and various connection statuses.\n\nThe device also has some icons above the LED indicators, which seem to represent different output modes or connection types, but their exact functionality isn't clear from the image alone.\n\nThe iPad beneath the AV Access device isn't fully visible, but it appears to be acting as a base or potentially interacting with the AV Access device in some way."
