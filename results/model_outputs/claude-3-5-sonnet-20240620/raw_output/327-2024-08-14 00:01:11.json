The left image appears to be the original photograph, while the right image is the edited version. \n\nThe main changes from left to right are:\n\n1. Improved brightness and contrast: The right image has better overall lighting, with the sky appearing brighter and clearer.\n\n2. Color correction: The colors in the right image are more vibrant and balanced, especially noticeable in the blue tones of the sky.\n\n3. Enhanced details: The buildings and structures in the right image appear sharper and more defined.\n\n4. Adjusted exposure: The sun's glare in the center of the image is slightly reduced, allowing for better visibility of the surrounding architecture.\n\n5. Improved shadows and highlights: The right image shows better definition in both the shadowed areas and the highlights, creating more depth in the scene.\n\nThe overall effect is a more polished and visually appealing image on the right, while maintaining the original composition and architectural elements of the cityscape."
