Considering the origin is at the bottom left corner, and the image is 700 pixels wide and 1050 pixels high, we can estimate that:\n\n1. Horizontally, the spoon tail is a bit more than halfway across the image from left to right, so around 400 pixels from the left edge.\n\n2. Vertically, the spoon tail is in the lower half of the image, approximately 200 pixels from the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail would be (400, 200)."
