Please note that these are approximate values:\n\nTop-left corner (x, y): (500, 100)\nBottom-right corner (x, y): (800, 400)\n\nSo the bounding box coordinates would be:\n[500, 100, 800, 400]\n\nThis estimation takes into account the strawberry's position at the top of the dessert, its size relative to the overall image, and its shape. The strawberry occupies roughly the upper middle portion of the image, sitting on top of what appears to be whipped cream on a rolled pastry or cake."
