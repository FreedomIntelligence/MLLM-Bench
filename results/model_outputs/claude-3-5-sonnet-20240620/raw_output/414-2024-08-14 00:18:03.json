The circular map is divided into segments representing the zodiac signs and other constellations, each illustrated with its mythological figure or associated animal.\n\nStarting from the top, we see Pisces (the Fish), represented by two fish connected by a cord. Moving clockwise, Aries (the Ram) is depicted with its curved horns. Triangulus (the Triangle) appears as a small geometric shape nearby.\n\nPegasus, the winged horse, dominates a large portion of the upper right quadrant, while Andromeda, depicted as a female figure, is positioned below it. Perseus, shown wielding a sword, is located to the left of Andromeda.\n\nCassiopeia, represented by a seated figure, is visible in the upper left portion. Below it, we find Auriga (the Charioteer) holding reins. The twins of Gemini are illustrated in the left side of the map.\n\nIn the center, Ursa Major (the Great Bear) is prominently featured, with its distinctive shape of the Big Dipper clearly visible. Nearby, Ursa Minor (the Little Bear) can be seen.\n\nLeo (the Lion) is depicted in the lower left quadrant, with its mane and tail clearly illustrated. Virgo (the Virgin) is shown as a winged figure in the bottom portion of the map.\n\nLibra (the Scales) is represented by its balance symbol in the lower right. Above it, we see Hercules depicted as a kneeling figure. Nearby, Ophiuchus (the Serpent Bearer) is shown grappling with a large serpent.\n\nOther notable constellations include Draco (the Dragon) winding through the northern sky, Cygnus (the Swan) with its distinctive cross shape, and Aquila (the Eagle) spreading its wings.\n\nThe map is framed by a circular border marked with degrees, likely representing celestial coordinates. Latin inscriptions and labels identify various stars and constellations throughout the image.\n\nThis star map is a beautiful example of historical celestial cartography, blending scientific observation with artistic representation of mythological figures associated with the constellations."
