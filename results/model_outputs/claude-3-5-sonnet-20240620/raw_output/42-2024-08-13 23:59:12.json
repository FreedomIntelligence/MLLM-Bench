This type of dish is often served as a dipping oil for bread in Mediterranean or Middle Eastern cuisine. It looks like the olive oil is infused with herbs (possibly oregano or za'atar) and possibly some seeds or chopped nuts, creating a flavorful accompaniment for the grilled pita bread slices next to it."
