These appear to be takeout-style food containers that would be appropriate for storing a sandwich.\n\nThere are several circular containers with lids shown in the image, arranged in different sizes. The larger ones among these would be ideal for a hand-sized sandwich. They seem to have enough depth to accommodate the thickness of a sandwich and enough diameter to fit its length and width comfortably.\n\nThe image doesn't show any containers that are specifically designed for sandwiches (like triangular sandwich boxes), so these round containers are the best option from what's available in the picture. They would keep the sandwich secure and prevent it from getting squashed during transport."
