The image shows a soccer match in progress, and there are two teams visible on the field. One team is wearing white jerseys, and there are 6 players from this team visible in the image. The other team has blue jerseys, but fewer players from this team can be seen. There's also a player in a red jersey who appears to be the goalkeeper, and a referee in yellow. So the largest group of players from a single team that can be counted in this picture is 6, which is the team in white."
