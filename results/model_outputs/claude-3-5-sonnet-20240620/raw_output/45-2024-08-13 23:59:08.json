The plate also contains a small red bowl, likely filled with dipping sauce, and a pair of chopsticks resting across it. Additionally, on the side, there are two small wooden circular boards with what look like dumplings or pot stickers. The entire presentation is served on a metal tray, giving it an appetizing and visually appealing look."
