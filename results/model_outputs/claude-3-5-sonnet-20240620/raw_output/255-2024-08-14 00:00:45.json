                "content": "This illustration showcases four different species of big cats, each with distinct features:\n\n1. Tiger (top left): Characterized by its orange coat with black stripes. It has a large, muscular body with a long tail. The face shows prominent whiskers and round ears.\n\n2. Lion (bottom left): Distinguished by its tawny coat and the male's iconic mane surrounding the face. It has a robust body, strong limbs, and a tufted tail.\n\n3. Mountain Lion or Cougar (top right): Depicted with a uniform tan or light brown coat without spots or stripes. It has a sleek body, a long tail, and a relatively small head compared to the other cats.\n\n4. Lioness with cubs (bottom right): This shows a female lion, lacking the mane of the male, with a tawny coat. She's accompanied by two small cubs, illustrating the species' social nature.\n\nKey differences include:\n- Coat patterns: Striped (tiger), plain (lion and mountain lion), or spotted (cubs)\n- Body shape: Varying from the muscular build of the tiger and lion to the leaner form of the mountain lion\n- Facial features: The lion's mane is a standout feature, while the tiger has more prominent whiskers\n- Tail length and shape: The mountain lion has a particularly long tail, while the lion's tail has a tuft at the end\n\nThese illustrations effectively highlight the unique characteristics that distinguish these big cat species from one another."
