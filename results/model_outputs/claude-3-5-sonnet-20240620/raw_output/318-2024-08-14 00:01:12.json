We can do this by finding the midpoint of the diameter given by the two points (1, -2) and (3, 2).\n\n2) Then, we'll calculate the radius of the circle.\n\n3) Finally, we'll use the general equation of a circle to write our answer.\n\nStep 1: Finding the center\nThe center is the midpoint of (1, -2) and (3, 2).\nx-coordinate of center: (1 + 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2\ny-coordinate of center: (-2 + 2) / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0\nSo, the center is at (2, 0).\n\nStep 2: Calculating the radius\nWe can find the radius by calculating the distance from the center to either point on the circumference. Let's use (3, 2):\nr\u00b2 = (3 - 2)\u00b2 + (2 - 0)\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5\nr = \u221a5\n\nStep 3: Writing the equation\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2 = r\u00b2, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.\n\nSubstituting our values:\n(x - 2)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2 = (\u221a5)\u00b2\n\nSimplifying:\n(x - 2)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 5\n\nThis is the equation of the circumference.\n\nThe methodological approach used here involves:\n1. Identifying key information from the given diagram (two points on the circle).\n2. Using the midpoint formula to find the center of the circle.\n3. Calculating the radius using the distance formula.\n4. Applying the general equation of a circle to formulate the final answer.\n\nThis approach demonstrates the application of coordinate geometry and circle properties to solve a practical problem."
