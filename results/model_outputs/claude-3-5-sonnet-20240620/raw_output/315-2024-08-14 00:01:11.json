                "content": "Certainly! Let's simplify this complex fraction using a clever approach. The key is to recognize a pattern in the numerator and denominator that can be exploited. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1) First, let's look at the numerator. We have (x/(x+1)) + 1. This can be rewritten as:\n   ((x/(x+1)) + ((x+1)/(x+1))) = (x + (x+1))/(x+1) = (2x+1)/(x+1)\n\n2) Now, let's look at the denominator. We have 1 - (x/(x-1)). This can be rewritten as:\n   ((x-1)/(x-1)) - (x/(x-1)) = ((x-1) - x)/(x-1) = -1/(x-1)\n\n3) So now our fraction looks like this:\n   ((2x+1)/(x+1)) / (-1/(x-1))\n\n4) Here's the clever part: when dividing by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So this becomes:\n   ((2x+1)/(x+1)) * ((x-1)/-1)\n\n5) Multiplying the numerators and denominators:\n   (-2x^2 + x + 1) / (-x - 1)\n\n6) Simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by -1:\n   (2x^2 - x - 1) / (x + 1)\n\nAnd there we have it! We've simplified the complex fraction to a much simpler form. This method avoids the need for finding a common denominator for the entire expression, which would have been more time-consuming and prone to errors."
