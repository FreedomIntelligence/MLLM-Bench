They have round white bodies, orange scarves or collars, and small crowns or crests on their heads. Their faces have simple features painted on, including eyes and beaks.\n\nAs for their functionality, these appear to be decorative or collectible items rather than having a specific practical function. They could serve several purposes:\n\n1. Toys: They might be used as playable figurines for children.\n2. Game pieces: They could be part of a board game or tabletop game.\n3. Decorative items: They might be used as cute ornaments or display pieces.\n4. Cake toppers: Their small size and uniform appearance suggest they could be used to decorate cakes or other desserts.\n\nThere's also a single black figurine among the white ones, which might indicate that these are part of a set or collection where the black one plays a special role, perhaps in a game or storytelling context.\n\nIn the background, there's a white serving tray visible, which is likely used for carrying drinks or food items, but it's not the main focus of the question about white objects in the image."
