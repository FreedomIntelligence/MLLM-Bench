Use the formula for the area of a circle: A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Identifying the radius:\n   The image shows a circle with several squares inside. The largest square has sides of length 6. The diagonal of this square forms the diameter of the circle. We can calculate the length of this diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n   Diagonal\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 6\u00b2 = 36 + 36 = 72\n   Diagonal = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2\n\n   The radius is half of this diagonal:\n   Radius = (6\u221a2) / 2 = 3\u221a2\n\n2. Calculating the area:\n   Now that we have the radius, we can use the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2\n\n   A = \u03c0(3\u221a2)\u00b2\n   A = \u03c0(18)\n   A = 18\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is 18\u03c0 square units.\n\nTo get a numerical approximation, we can use \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159:\n18\u03c0 \u2248 18 * 3.14159 \u2248 56.55 square units\n\nSo the exact area is 18\u03c0 square units, or approximately 56.55 square units."
