The image shows a produce section of a store with various fruits displayed, including oranges, mangoes, and what appear to be lemons or limes, but there isn't a visible sign with that specific pricing for lemons.\n\nThe signs I can see in the image include:\n- \"Navel Oranges 4/5\" (approximately at coordinates (200, 700))\n- \"Mango 1.99\" (approximately at coordinates (400, 700))\n\nIf you're looking for the location of lemons specifically, they appear to be the yellow fruits on the right side of the image, approximately at coordinates (550, 450). However, there's no pricing sign visible for them in this particular image."
