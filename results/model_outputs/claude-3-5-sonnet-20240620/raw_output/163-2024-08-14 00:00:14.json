                "content": "The speech is about the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students. The speaker presents three main reasons to support this viewpoint.\n\nSeveral rhetorical codes are used in the speech:\n\n1. Hypophora: The speaker poses questions and then answers them, such as \"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college? What criteria will universities follow to admit students?\"\n\n2. Anaphora: Repetition is used for emphasis, as in \"they have money, they have parents' with higher social status, they have better connections.\"\n\n3. Antithesis: The speaker contrasts ideas, stating \"Your family or money doesn't help here \u2013 it's all about how much you study and what you can do.\"\n\n4. Pathos: Emotional appeal is used when discussing how exams can change the fates of students from poor families.\n\n5. Ethos: The speaker cites Einstein to add credibility to the argument about learning.\n\n6. Metaphor: The exams are described as \"keys to the future,\" comparing them to tools that unlock opportunities.\n\nThese rhetorical devices are employed to strengthen the speaker's arguments, engage the audience, and make the speech more persuasive and memorable."
