The laptop of the person on the right: In the upper image, the laptop has dots or a pattern on it. In the lower image, the laptop is plain.\n\n2. The drink in front of the person in the brown shirt: In the upper image, it's a clear glass. In the lower image, it's a green mug.\n\n3. The bottle on the table: In the upper image, there's a green bottle visible on the table. In the lower image, this bottle is missing.\n\n4. The person in the orange polka-dot outfit: In the upper image, they're holding a tablet or smartphone. In the lower image, their hands are empty on the table.\n\n5. The shoes of the person on the far left: In the upper image, the shoes are a solid color. In the lower image, the shoes have a two-tone design with a lighter color on the toe area.\n\nThese are the five differences I've identified between the two versions of the illustration."
