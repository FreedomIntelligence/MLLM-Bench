The game is played on a 4x4 grid.\n2. Tiles with numbers are placed on the grid.\n3. The player can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right.\n4. When moved, tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction.\n5. If two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.\n6. After each move, a new tile (usually with a value of 2 or 4) appears in an empty spot.\n7. The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048 (or higher powers of 2).\n8. The game ends when no more moves are possible.\n9. The score increases with each merge, based on the value of the merged tile.\n\nHere's a basic Python implementation of the 2048 game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Game2048:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n        self.score = 0\n        self.add_new_tile()\n        self.add_new_tile()\n\n    def add_new_tile(self):\n        empty_cells = [(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if self.grid[i][j] == 0]\n        if empty_cells:\n            i, j = random.choice(empty_cells)\n            self.grid[i][j] = 2 if random.random() < 0.9 else 4\n\n    def move(self, direction):\n        moved = False\n        if direction in [\"up\", \"down\"]:\n            for j in range(4):\n                column = [self.grid[i][j] for i in range(4)]\n                if direction == \"up\":\n                    column = self.merge(column)\n                else:\n                    column = self.merge(column[::-1])[::-1]\n                for i in range(4):\n                    if self.grid[i][j] != column[i]:\n                        moved = True\n                    self.grid[i][j] = column[i]\n        elif direction in [\"left\", \"right\"]:\n            for i in range(4):\n                row = self.grid[i]\n                if direction == \"left\":\n                    row = self.merge(row)\n                else:\n                    row = self.merge(row[::-1])[::-1]\n                if self.grid[i] != row:\n                    moved = True\n                self.grid[i] = row\n        \n        if moved:\n            self.add_new_tile()\n        return moved\n\n    def merge(self, line):\n        new_line = [x for x in line if x != 0]\n        for i in range(len(new_line) - 1):\n            if new_line[i] == new_line[i + 1]:\n                new_line[i] *= 2\n                self.score += new_line[i]\n                new_line[i + 1] = 0\n        new_line = [x for x in new_line if x != 0]\n        return new_line + [0] * (4 - len(new_line))\n\n    def is_game_over(self):\n        if any(0 in row for row in self.grid):\n            return False\n        for i in range(4):\n            for j in range(4):\n                if j < 3 and self.grid[i][j] == self.grid[i][j + 1]:\n                    return False\n                if i < 3 and self.grid[i][j] == self.grid[i + 1][j]:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    def print_grid(self):\n        for row in self.grid:\n            print(\" \".join(f\"{x:4d}\" for x in row))\n        print(f\"Score: {self.score}\")\n\n# Example usage:\ngame = Game2048()\nwhile not game.is_game_over():\n    game.print_grid()\n    move = input(\"Enter move (up/down/left/right): \")\n    if move"
