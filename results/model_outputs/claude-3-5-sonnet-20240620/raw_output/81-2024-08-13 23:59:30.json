Grilling or Roasting: The skewered meat pieces (likely kebabs) appear to have been grilled or roasted, giving them a charred, cooked appearance.\n\n2. Frying: Some of the items, particularly the patties or cutlets visible, may have been pan-fried or deep-fried.\n\n3. Stewing or Simmering: The red sauce or curry visible in some of the sandwiches suggests a slow-cooking method like stewing or simmering to develop flavors.\n\n4. Baking: The bread used for the sandwiches was likely baked.\n\n5. Assembly: While not a cooking method per se, the sandwiches have clearly been assembled by combining various cooked ingredients.\n\n6. Possibly Steaming: Some of the items, particularly the lighter-colored patties, might have been steamed before being added to the sandwiches.\n\nThese methods have transformed raw ingredients into a variety of street food dishes, including kebabs, various types of sandwiches or rolls, and possibly some fried snacks or cutlets."
