The logo in the top left corner of the left image is missing in the right image.\n\n2. The child's hair length is different - longer in the left image, shorter in the right image.\n\n3. There's a wreath on the gingerbread house in the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n\n4. The color of the decorations above the door of the gingerbread house is different - red in the left image, yellow in the right image.\n\n5. The snowflakes in the background are positioned differently between the two images.\n\n6. The text \"Oxymax Playroom\" appears in the bottom right corner of the right image but is not present in the left image.\n\n7. The border color of the frames is different - blue in the left image, red in the right image.\n\nThese are the 7 differences I've noticed between the two images."
