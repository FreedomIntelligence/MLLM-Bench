                "content": "Based on the puzzle shown in the image, the piece that should be placed in the second row and first column is the one with the apple. This is because:\n\n1. The first row establishes that apple + apple = 2, so each apple has a value of 1.\n2. The second row already has an apple and equals 4, so the missing piece must be 3 to make the equation work (1 + 3 = 4).\n\nTherefore, the apple piece should be placed in the second row, first column to complete that equation correctly.\n\nAs for the arithmetic question in the image: (1 apple + 3 bananas) \u00d7 2 strawberries = ?\n\nWe can solve this using the values we've deduced from the puzzle:\n- 1 apple = 1\n- 1 banana = 2 (because apple + banana + banana = 7, so 1 + 2 + 2 = 7)\n- 1 strawberry = 3 (because strawberry + banana + banana = 7, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7)\n\nNow we can calculate:\n(1 + 3 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = (1 + 6) \u00d7 6 = 7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n\nTherefore, the answer to the arithmetic question is 42."
