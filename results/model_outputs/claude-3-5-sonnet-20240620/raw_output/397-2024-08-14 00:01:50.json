The table shown is a Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and it does not contain any direct information about capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures are typically found in the \"Cash flows from investing activities\" section of a cash flow statement, which is not present in this image. The data provided includes various income statement and balance sheet items, but not the specific capital expenditure figures needed for such a prediction.\n\nTo make a prediction about capital expenditures using linear regression, we would need:\n\n1. Historical capital expenditure data for at least three years (preferably more).\n2. To perform a linear regression analysis on that data.\n\nWithout this information, it's not possible to make an accurate prediction about capital expenditures for 2023."
