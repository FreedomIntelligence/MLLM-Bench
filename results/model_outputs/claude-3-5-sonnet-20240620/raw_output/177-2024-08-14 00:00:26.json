Given that the image size is 4096x4096 pixels, and the spoon is located in the lower right quadrant of the image, I would approximate the coordinates as follows:\n\nx1 (left): 2800\ny1 (top): 3400\nx2 (right): 3200\ny2 (bottom): 3900\n\nThese coordinates form a rectangle that should encompass the decorative spoon visible in the image. Please note that these are estimates based on visual inspection, and the actual precise coordinates may vary slightly."
