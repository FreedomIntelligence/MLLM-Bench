Octopus tentacles: These are the primary component of the dish, showing the distinctive suction cup pattern characteristic of octopus.\n\n2. Lime: There's a wedge of lime in the bowl, which is likely used for squeezing over the octopus to add acidity and freshness.\n\n3. Seasoning: While not explicitly visible, the octopus appears to be seasoned and possibly marinated, given its golden-brown color. This could involve ingredients like olive oil, garlic, herbs, and spices.\n\nThe octopus is served in a brown ceramic bowl, placed on what looks like a menu or wine list from a restaurant called \"Fallow\". The presentation suggests this is likely an appetizer or tapas-style dish served at an upscale restaurant."
