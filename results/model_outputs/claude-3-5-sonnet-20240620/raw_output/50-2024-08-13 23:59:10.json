The Eiffel Tower is most commonly associated with the late 19th century, specifically the year 1889 when it was completed and opened as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair.\n\nThis period marks the Belle \u00c9poque in French history, a time of optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity, and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. The Eiffel Tower became a symbol of this era and of French engineering prowess.\n\nWhile the tower itself represents this specific time period, it has since become an enduring symbol of Paris and France, featuring prominently in many historical events and periods throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. However, its construction and initial purpose are firmly rooted in the late 19th century industrial age and the World's Fair of 1889."
