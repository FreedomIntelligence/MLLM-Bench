At 11:00, 4 more people came to the zoo.\n   So, at 11:00, the total number of people was: 5 + 4 = 9 people\n\n3. At noon, 7 more people came to the zoo.\n   Now we need to add these 7 people to the previous total:\n   9 + 7 = 16 people\n\nTherefore, there are now 16 people at the zoo.\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is a simple addition problem that involves keeping track of how many people arrive at the zoo at different times. We start with the initial number of people and then add the new arrivals at each time point. The key is to remember that each new group adds to the total that was already there, not just to the previous group that arrived."
