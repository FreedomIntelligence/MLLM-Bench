The bald eagle is shown flying just above the water surface with its talons extended, ready to grasp its prey. Water droplets are visible around its feet, indicating it has just made contact with or is about to make contact with the water to snatch a fish. This moment captures the precise instant of the hunt where the eagle is seizing its prey from the water, which is a critical and dramatic part of its fishing technique."
