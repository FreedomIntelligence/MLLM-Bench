                "content": "I'll analyze each equation for correctness:\n\n1) a\u00b3 \u00f7 a\u2075 = a\u00b3\u207b\u2075 = a\u207b\u00b2 = 1/a\u00b2 (a \u2260 0)\n   This equation is correct. When dividing exponential terms with the same base, we subtract the exponents. The negative exponent is then correctly expressed as a fraction.\n\n2) (0.0001)\u2070 = (100000)\u2070\n   This equation is correct. Any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Both sides of this equation equal 1.\n\n3) m\u00b3 \u00f7 m\u00b3 = m\u00b3\u207b\u00b3 = m\u2070 = 1\n   This equation is correct. When dividing the same terms, the exponents are subtracted, resulting in m\u2070, which equals 1 for any non-zero m.\n\n4) 8x\u00b9\u2070 \u00f7 2x\u00b2 = 4x\u2078\n   This equation is correct. 8 divided by 2 is 4, and x\u00b9\u2070 divided by x\u00b2 is x\u2078 (subtracting exponents).\n\n5) (x^n)\u00b2 \u00f7 x^n = x\u00b2\n   This equation is incorrect. The left side should simplify to x^n, not x\u00b2. The correct equation would be (x^n)\u00b2 \u00f7 x^n = x^n.\n\nIn conclusion, 4 out of the 5 equations are correct."
