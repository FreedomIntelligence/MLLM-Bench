A red firefighter helmet with a badge or emblem on the front\n2. A yellow and red striped vest that resembles firefighter protective gear\n3. A toy water gun or hose-like device, which mimics firefighting equipment\n4. A small red canister on the back, likely representing an oxygen tank or fire extinguisher\n\nHowever, given the small size of the individual and the toy-like nature of the equipment, this is clearly a child's costume or dress-up outfit rather than actual firefighting gear. The image shows a young child playing or dressing up as a firefighter, not an actual professional."
