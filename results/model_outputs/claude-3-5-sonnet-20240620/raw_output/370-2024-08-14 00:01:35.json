                "content": "Certainly! I'll write a Python program that evaluates the factorials of integers from p to q, where p and q are input by the user. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\ndef print_factorials(p, q):\n    print(f\"{p} {q}\")\n    for i in range(p, q+1):\n        result = factorial(i)\n        print(f\"{i}! = {result}\")\n\n# Get input from user\np = int(input(\"Enter the starting number (p): \"))\nq = int(input(\"Enter the ending number (q): \"))\n\n# Ensure p is not greater than q\nif p > q:\n    p, q = q, p\n\n# Print the factorials\nprint_factorials(p, q)\n```\n\nThis program does the following:\n\n1. We define a `factorial()` function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.\n\n2. We define a `print_factorials()` function that takes two parameters `p` and `q`, and prints the factorials of all integers from `p` to `q`.\n\n3. We get the input for `p` and `q` from the user.\n\n4. We check if `p` is greater than `q`. If it is, we swap them to ensure we always calculate factorials from the smaller to the larger number.\n\n5. Finally, we call the `print_factorials()` function with the user's input.\n\nThis program will produce output similar to what's shown in the image. For example, if the user enters 1 and 5 for p and q respectively, the output will be:\n\n```\n1 5\n1! = 1\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n5! = 120\n```\n\nAnd if the user enters 3 and 8, the output will match the second example in the image:\n\n```\n3 8\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n5! = 120\n6! = 720\n7! = 5040\n8! = 40320\n```\n\nThis program fulfills the requirements specified in the image, calculating and displaying factorials for a range of integers input by the user."
