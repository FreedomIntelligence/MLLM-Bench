The player is shown dribbling the ball up the court, not in a shooting position. He's in the middle of the court, far from the basket, and would need more than a fraction of a second to get into a scoring position or attempt a shot. Basketball plays typically take several seconds to develop, even for fast breaks or quick shots. The player's current posture and position on the court indicate he's in the process of advancing the ball, not immediately preparing to score."
