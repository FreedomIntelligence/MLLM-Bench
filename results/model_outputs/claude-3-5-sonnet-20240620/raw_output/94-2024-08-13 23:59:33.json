This historical diagram depicts a phrenological map of the human head, which was a pseudoscientific theory popular in the 19th century that claimed personality traits and mental faculties could be determined by the shape of one's skull. Other potential hashtags could include:\n\n#HistoryOfScience\n#VictorianPseudoscience\n#AntiqueMedicalIllustration\n#HistoricalDiagram\n\nAny of these would help categorize the content and make it discoverable to those interested in historical scientific illustrations or the history of psychology and neuroscience."
