The setting appears to be a classroom, with educational posters visible on the walls and a whiteboard in the background. The group is gathered around a table with several small globes and a light, suggesting they are engaged in some kind of educational activity or experiment related to geography or earth science. Their casual clothing and the classroom environment strongly indicate that these are school students, likely in middle or high school, participating in a hands-on learning exercise."
