The image shows a series of photos where a person uses a large kitchen strainer or colander with long bristles to mimic a Viking's beard and helmet. In the final panel, there's a cartoon illustration of a Viking for comparison.\n\nThis playful DIY costume demonstrates ingenuity and a sense of humor, turning everyday objects into a fun costume piece. The progression from holding the \"beard\" to fully embodying the Viking character is both clever and amusing.\n\nA proper hashtag for this image could be:\n\n#DIYVikingCosplay\n\nThis hashtag captures the essence of the creative, do-it-yourself approach to costume-making and the specific Viking theme portrayed in the image."
