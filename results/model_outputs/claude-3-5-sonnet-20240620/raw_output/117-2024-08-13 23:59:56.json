Their eyes are tightly shut, mouth wide open as if yelling or shouting, and their overall posture suggests intense frustration or rage. They are holding a telephone receiver close to their face, which implies they are in the middle of a heated phone conversation.\n\nThis type of reaction could be caused by several factors:\n\n1. Receiving extremely upsetting news over the phone\n2. Dealing with poor customer service or a frustrating automated phone system\n3. Having an argument with someone on the other end of the line\n4. Being put on hold for an extended period\n5. Receiving unexpected or exorbitant charges\n6. Being denied a service or request they feel entitled to\n\nThe person's formal attire (wearing a blazer) suggests this could be a work-related call, which might add to the stress and frustration if it involves a business matter or professional relationship.\n\nThe presence of eyeglasses on the table might indicate that this person has been dealing with this issue for some time, possibly removing them due to stress or to rub their eyes in exasperation.\n\nOverall, the facial expression and body language convey a moment of peak frustration or anger during what appears to be a very difficult phone conversation."
