This would typically correspond to the d1 square on a standard chess board, which is the traditional starting position for the queen in chess.\n\nThe chess set shown is a decorative pink and clear glass set, with pink pieces on one side and clear glass pieces on the other. The board itself is also pink and white, matching the aesthetic of the pieces."
