Large hypodense area in the right cerebral hemisphere, measuring approximately 7-8 cm in diameter, consistent with an acute or subacute infarct in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA).\n\n2. Significant mass effect associated with the infarct, causing:\n   - Midline shift to the left of approximately 1.5 cm\n   - Compression of the right lateral ventricle\n   - Effacement of cortical sulci in the right hemisphere\n\n3. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n4. Left cerebral hemisphere appears normal with no focal lesions.\n\n5. Basal cisterns are partially compressed but still visible.\n\n6. No obvious skull fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nImpression:\n\n1. Large right MCA territory infarct with significant mass effect and midline shift, suggesting a possible malignant MCA infarction.\n\n2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n3. Urgent neurosurgical consultation is recommended to evaluate for potential decompressive hemicraniectomy, given the extent of the infarct and mass effect.\n\n4. Close monitoring for neurological deterioration is crucial.\n\n5. Consider follow-up imaging to assess progression of edema and mass effect."
