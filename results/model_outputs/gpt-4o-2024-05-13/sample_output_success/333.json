The glass is shattered, and there are visible cracks spreading from the damaged area. Additionally, the frame appears to be bent or broken near the damaged corner.\n\nHere are some considerations regarding usability without repair:\n\n1. **Structural Integrity**: The shattered back glass and potentially damaged frame could compromise the structural integrity of the phone, making it more susceptible to further damage.\n\n2. **Safety**: The broken glass can pose a risk of cuts or injuries when handling the phone.\n\n3. **Functionality**: While the image does not show the front of the phone or the screen, the damage to the back and frame could affect internal components, potentially impacting the phone's functionality. The camera lenses appear to be intact, but it's unclear if the internal camera components are undamaged.\n\n4. **Water Resistance**: If the phone was originally water-resistant, this damage likely compromises that feature, increasing the risk of water damage.\n\nGiven the extent of the damage, it is advisable to get the phone repaired to ensure safety and maintain functionality. Using it without repair could lead to further damage or potential injury."
