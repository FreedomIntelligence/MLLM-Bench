This texture is typically achieved with materials like oil paint or heavy body acrylic paint, as both can be applied thickly and retain brush or palette knife marks. \n\nGiven the vibrant colors and the pronounced texture, it is likely that either oil paints or heavy body acrylic paints were used to create these paintings. Watercolors, in contrast, are generally more fluid and less capable of producing such pronounced texture."
