Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Top Left (Pork Belly Slices)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: High. Visible layers of fat and meat.\n   - **Handling**: Often used in slow cooking or frying to render the fat.\n\n2. **Top Center (Sausages)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Variable, but generally moderate to high due to the inclusion of fat in the meat mixture.\n   - **Handling**: Typically ground meat mixed with spices and encased. Can be grilled, fried, or baked.\n\n3. **Top Right (Lean Beef Strips)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Low. Little to no visible fat.\n   - **Handling**: Often used for stir-frying or quick cooking methods.\n\n4. **Second Row Left (Pork Chops with Fat Cap)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Moderate. Fat cap on the edge.\n   - **Handling**: Can be grilled, baked, or fried. The fat cap adds flavor and moisture.\n\n5. **Second Row Center (Pork Cutlets)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Low to moderate. Some visible fat.\n   - **Handling**: Suitable for grilling, frying, or baking.\n\n6. **Second Row Right (Ground Beef)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Variable, but generally moderate.\n   - **Handling**: Used for making burgers, meatloaf, or sauces.\n\n7. **Third Row Left (Pork Ribs)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: High. Visible fat layers.\n   - **Handling**: Often slow-cooked, smoked, or barbecued to render fat and tenderize the meat.\n\n8. **Third Row Center (Beef Patties)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Variable, but generally moderate.\n   - **Handling**: Used for making hamburgers. Can be grilled, fried, or broiled.\n\n9. **Third Row Right (Ground Beef)**:\n   - **Fat Content**: Variable, but generally moderate.\n   - **Handling**: Used for making burgers, meatloaf, or sauces.\n\n10. **Bottom Right (Beef Stew Meat)**:\n    - **Fat Content**: Low to moderate. Little visible fat.\n    - **Handling**: Used for stews, braising, or slow cooking.\n\nEach type of meat has distinct characteristics in terms of fat content and the methods by which they are typically prepared. This affects their flavor, texture, and suitability for different recipes."
