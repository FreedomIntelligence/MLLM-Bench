The next move would likely involve him landing back on the skateboard and continuing to ride. \n\n### Risk Assessment:\n1. **Landing**: The primary risk is the landing. If he doesn't land properly on the board, he could fall, potentially causing injury.\n2. **Surface**: The concrete surface of the skate park is hard and unforgiving, increasing the risk of injury in case of a fall.\n3. **Speed and Height**: The height and speed at which he is performing the trick add to the risk. Higher jumps and faster speeds can result in more severe impacts.\n4. **Skill Level**: Assuming he is skilled (given the complexity of the trick), the risk is mitigated but not eliminated.\n\n### Safety Measures:\n1. **Protective Gear**: Wearing a helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards can reduce the severity of injuries.\n2. **Practice**: Ensuring that he has practiced the trick multiple times in a controlled environment.\n3. **Awareness**: Being aware of his surroundings and ensuring the skate park is clear of obstacles and other skaters.\n\nOverall, while skateboarding tricks inherently involve some risk, proper precautions and skill can significantly reduce the likelihood of injury."
