The man on the right is Shaquille O'Neal, who is 7 feet 1 inch (216 cm) tall. \n\nThe woman appears to be significantly shorter than both men. Based on the visual comparison, she seems to be around shoulder height of Shaquille O'Neal, who is approximately 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet tall (173 cm to 183 cm) at shoulder height.\n\nGiven this visual estimation, the woman is likely around 5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 3 inches (155 cm to 160 cm) tall."
