Here are some observations regarding their engagement:\n\n1. **Presenter**: The individual standing and pointing at the screen appears to be actively engaged in delivering the presentation. Their posture and gesture indicate they are explaining the content displayed on the screen.\n\n2. **Audience Members**:\n   - **Left Side**: The two individuals on the left are facing the presenter and seem to be paying attention. The person closest to the presenter has their hands on the table, which might indicate attentiveness.\n   - **Center**: The individual in the center, with a laptop in front of them, is looking at the screen. This could indicate they are either following along with the presentation or possibly multitasking.\n   - **Right Side**: The person on the right, with a beard, is looking down at something in front of them, possibly a notebook or a device, which might suggest they are taking notes or are distracted.\n   - **Far Right**: The individual with curly hair appears to be looking towards the presenter, suggesting they are engaged.\n\nOverall, most of the audience members appear to be engaged, with their body language directed towards the presenter or the screen. However, there are a few indicators of possible disengagement, such as the individual looking down at their device or notes."
