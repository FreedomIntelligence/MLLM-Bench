Nectar provides essential nutrients and energy for the bird.\n\n### Benefits to the Flower:\n1. **Pollination**: As the bird feeds on the nectar, it inadvertently collects pollen on its body from the flower. When the bird visits the next flower, some of this pollen is transferred, aiding in the plant's reproductive process.\n2. **Increased Genetic Diversity**: Pollination by birds can help increase genetic diversity among plant populations, as pollen is transferred between different plants.\n\n### Harm or Costs:\n1. **Minimal Harm**: There is generally minimal harm to either party in this interaction. The flower provides nectar specifically to attract pollinators like birds, and the bird does not typically damage the flower while feeding.\n\nIn summary, this mutualistic interaction benefits both the bird (by providing food) and the flower (by facilitating pollination)."
