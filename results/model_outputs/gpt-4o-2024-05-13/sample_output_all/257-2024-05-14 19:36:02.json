Cheese adds to the fat and calorie count, while vegetables like lettuce and onions add some fiber and vitamins.\n\n2. **Top Right Hamburger**:\n   - **Ingredients**: Fried chicken patty, lettuce, and sauce.\n   - **Nutritional Cues**: The fried chicken patty indicates high fat and calorie content due to the frying process. Lettuce adds minimal calories but some fiber.\n\n3. **Bottom Left Sandwich**:\n   - **Ingredients**: Grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and sauce.\n   - **Nutritional Cues**: Grilled chicken is a lean protein source, making this option potentially lower in fat compared to the fried chicken burger. The inclusion of fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions adds fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\n\n4. **Bottom Right Hamburger**:\n   - **Ingredients**: Beef patties, cheese, pickles, lettuce, and sauce.\n   - **Nutritional Cues**: The double beef patties suggest a higher protein and fat content. Cheese adds to the fat and calorie count, while pickles and lettuce provide minimal calories but some fiber and vitamins.\n\nIn summary:\n- The **Top Left Hamburger** and **Bottom Right Hamburger** are likely the highest in calories and fat due to the beef patties, bacon, and cheese.\n- The **Top Right Hamburger** has high fat and calorie content due to the fried chicken patty.\n- The **Bottom Left Sandwich** is potentially the healthiest option with lean protein from grilled chicken and a variety of fresh vegetables."
