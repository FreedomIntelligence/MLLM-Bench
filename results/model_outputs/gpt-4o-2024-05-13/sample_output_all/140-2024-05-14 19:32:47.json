Here’s a breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. **Irony**: The humor arises from the ironic situation where the man's enthusiasm for dogs contrasts sharply with the woman's dislike for them. The man's response to her dislike is unexpected and humorous because it defies the typical reaction one might expect in such a situation.\n\n2. **Absurdity**: The second panel introduces an absurd element by replacing the woman with a dog, which is highly unexpected and illogical. This absurdity amplifies the humor because it’s an extreme and exaggerated reaction to the woman's statement.\n\n3. **Visual Humor**: The visual gag of the woman being replaced by a dog adds a layer of visual humor. The serious expressions of the characters juxtaposed with the absurdity of the situation enhance the comedic effect.\n\n4. **Catchphrase**: The phrase “This is the way!” is a reference to popular culture (specifically, \"The Mandalorian\" series), and its use in this context adds a layer of parody. It’s humorous because it’s being used in an incongruous situation, thus adding to the overall comedic effect.\n\nOverall, the meme uses irony and absurdity, with a touch of parody, to create a humorous and unexpected scenario."
