Here’s an analysis of the emotive language and its potential impact:\n\n1. **\"As judge brands teacher’s murderer ‘evil’, hear the full heart-rending story on our award-winning podcast\"**\n   - **Emotive Words**: \"brands,\" \"murderer,\" \"evil,\" \"heart-rending.\"\n   - **Impact**: The use of the word \"evil\" is highly charged and conveys a strong moral judgment, likely to provoke anger and condemnation. \"Heart-rending\" suggests that the story will be deeply emotional and distressing, encouraging readers to engage with the podcast for an intense emotional experience.\n\n2. **\"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\"**\n   - **Emotive Words**: \"COME FOR,\" \"YOU COME FOR US ALL.\"\n   - **Impact**: The repetition and capitalization of \"COME FOR\" creates a sense of urgency and threat. It suggests that an attack on Suella is an attack on a broader group, likely intended to rally support and solidarity among readers who identify with the group.\n\n3. **\"Tory Right’s warning to Rishi amid fears he’s thinking of sacking Home Secretary\"**\n   - **Emotive Words**: \"warning,\" \"fears,\" \"sacking.\"\n   - **Impact**: \"Warning\" and \"fears\" imply a sense of impending danger or conflict. \"Sacking\" is a strong term that conveys a drastic action, which could stir anxiety and concern among readers who support the Home Secretary.\n\nOverall, the emotive language used in these headlines is designed to capture attention and elicit strong emotional responses, whether it's anger, fear, or solidarity. This type of language is effective in engaging readers and driving them to read more or take action, but it can also polarize and heighten tensions."
