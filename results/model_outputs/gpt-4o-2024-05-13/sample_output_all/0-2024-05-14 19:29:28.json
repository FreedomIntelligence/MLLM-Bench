The architectural style of the Manhattan Bridge is characterized by its steel suspension design, which was a common engineering approach in the early 20th century.\n\n**Architectural Features:**\n\n1. **Steel Cables and Towers:** The bridge features prominent steel cables that support the bridge deck, anchored by large steel towers. These towers are designed with a lattice framework, providing both strength and an intricate visual pattern.\n\n2. **Suspension Design:** The bridge's main span is suspended from the cables, allowing it to support heavy loads and spanning a significant distance over the river. This design is both functional and aesthetically appealing, showcasing the engineering prowess of the era.\n\n3. **Art Deco Elements:** While primarily functional, the bridge also includes some Art Deco elements, particularly in the detailing of the towers and the decorative motifs.\n\n4. **Granite Anchors:** The base of the towers is anchored into large granite blocks, adding to the stability and durability of the structure.\n\n5. **Urban Integration:** The bridge is seamlessly integrated into the urban landscape, connecting the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The image captures the view from the Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) neighborhood in Brooklyn, emphasizing the bridge's role in the city's infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the Manhattan Bridge is an iconic example of early 20th-century bridge engineering, combining functional design with aesthetic elements that contribute to its enduring appeal."
