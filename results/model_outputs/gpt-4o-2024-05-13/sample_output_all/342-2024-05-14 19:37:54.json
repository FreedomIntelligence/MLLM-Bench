It infringes upon their right to feel secure and to possess their belongings without fear of theft.\n\n3. **Moral Integrity**: The robber's actions demonstrate a lack of moral integrity and respect for societal laws and norms. It reflects a disregard for the ethical principle of treating others with respect and fairness.\n\n4. **Psychological Impact**: The victim in the image is likely to experience psychological trauma, fear, and anxiety due to the threatening situation.
