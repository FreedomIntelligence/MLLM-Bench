Metadata could provide information about the software used to create or modify the image.\n\n5. **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**:\n   - ELA can reveal areas of the image with different levels of compression, which might indicate editing.\n   - In an ELA analysis, if the shark shows different compression levels compared to the rest of the image, it would suggest that the shark was added or altered.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the visual inspection and edge detection, there are signs that the shark might have been added to the image. The sharpness and clarity of the shark, as well as slight color discrepancies, suggest potential alteration. However, without metadata and ELA analysis, this conclusion remains tentative. The image likely has been manipulated to include the shark beneath the person on the inflatable ring."
