The position of the man being lifted, draped over the shoulder of the standing man, suggests a few possible techniques:\n\n1. **Fireman's Carry**: This is a common wrestling move where the wrestler lifts their opponent onto their shoulders and then throws them to the mat. The standing man's position and grip suggest he might be preparing to drop his opponent backward or sideways.\n\n2. **Samoan Drop**: In this move, the wrestler falls backward to slam their opponent to the mat. Given the standing man's posture and the way he is holding his opponent, this could be a likely technique he is about to use.\n\n3. **Attitude Adjustment (AA)**: This is a move popularized in professional wrestling where the wrestler lifts the opponent onto their shoulders and then flips them forward, slamming them onto the mat.\n\nThe exact move will depend on the next action of the standing man, but these are some of the possible techniques he might be preparing to execute based on the current stance and gesture."
