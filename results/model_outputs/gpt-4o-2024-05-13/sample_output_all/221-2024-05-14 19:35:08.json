This interaction is a classic example of mutualistic symbiosis, where both species benefit from the relationship.\n\n### Reasons the Small Fish are Not Attacked:\n1. **Cleaning Service**: The smaller fish, such as pilot fish, often clean parasites and dead skin off the shark, which helps keep the shark healthy.\n2. **Food Scraps**: The smaller fish benefit from the shark by feeding on the leftovers of the shark's meals, ensuring they have a reliable food source.\n3. **Protection**: The smaller fish gain protection from predators by staying close to the shark, as other predators tend to avoid the larger, more dangerous shark.\n\n### Relationship Categorization:\n- **Mutualism**: This relationship is mutualistic because both the shark and the smaller fish benefit from each other's presence. The shark gets cleaned, and the smaller fish get food and protection.\n\nIn summary, the interaction between the shark and the smaller fish is mutually beneficial, which is why the shark does not attack them. This mutualistic relationship enhances the survival and well-being of both species involved."
