The handle appears to be broken or severely cracked, with the grip material partially detached. Here are some suggestions to repair it:\n\n1. **Replacement of the Handle:**\n   - **Remove the Old Handle:** Carefully detach the remnants of the broken handle from the racquet shaft.\n   - **Purchase a New Handle:** Obtain a replacement handle from a sporting goods store or online.\n   - **Attach the New Handle:** Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to securely attach the new handle to the racquet shaft. This may involve using an adhesive or screws.\n   - **Re-wrap the Grip:** Once the new handle is attached, re-wrap it with a new grip tape for comfort and better control.\n\n2. **Temporary Fix:**\n   - **Glue and Tape:** If a replacement handle is not immediately available, you can temporarily fix the handle by applying strong adhesive glue to the broken parts and wrapping it tightly with athletic tape. This is only a temporary solution and may not provide the same level of performance or durability.\n\n3. **Professional Repair:**\n   - **Visit a Specialist:** Take the racquet to a professional sports equipment repair shop. They can provide a more durable repair or replacement handle, ensuring the racquet is restored to a playable condition.\n\n4. **Consider Replacement:**\n   - **Evaluate the Cost:** If the racquet is extensively damaged or if repair costs are high, it might be more economical to purchase a new racquet.\n\nEnsure any repair is done properly to maintain the structural integrity and performance of the racquet."
