The use of soft brushstrokes and the blending of warm colors like orange, yellow, and red suggest a sense of tenderness and closeness between the two animals. The gentle, almost nuzzling interaction between the foxes is accentuated by their closed eyes and serene expressions, which convey a feeling of love and contentment. The simplicity of the background, which is left mostly white, helps to focus attention on the emotional connection between the foxes. Overall, the artwork evokes a sense of intimacy and affection."
