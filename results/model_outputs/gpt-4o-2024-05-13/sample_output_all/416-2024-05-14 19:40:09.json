The design features a central rosette, composed of interlocking circular motifs, radiating outward into a complex arrangement of petal-like forms. Each layer of the carving reveals a progression of nested, angular shapes, with finely etched lines that enhance the three-dimensional quality of the piece. The overall composition maintains a striking balance between symmetry and asymmetry, as the repetitive patterns converge and diverge, creating a dynamic visual rhythm. The rich, natural hues of the wood are accentuated by the interplay of light and shadow, emphasizing the craftsmanship and intricate details of the carving. The outermost edges of the piece are framed by a series of linear and curved elements, adding to the harmonious yet intricate nature of the design."
