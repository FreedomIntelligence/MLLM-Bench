The plot includes a trend line, and the following statistical information is provided:\n\n- Correlation: -0.47\n- p-Value: 0.0004\n- R-Square: 0.225\n- OLS Slope: -0.59\n\nFrom this information, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **Negative Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of -0.47 indicates a moderate negative relationship between the vaccination rate and excess deaths. This suggests that as the vaccination rate increases, the number of excess deaths tends to decrease.\n2. **Statistical Significance**: The p-value of 0.0004 is much lower than the common threshold of 0.05, indicating that the relationship observed is statistically significant.\n3. **Explained Variance**: The R-square value of 0.225 means that approximately 22.5% of the variance in excess deaths can be explained by the vaccination rate. This indicates that while the vaccination rate is a significant factor, other variables also play a role in determining excess deaths.\n4. **Slope**: The OLS slope of -0.59 suggests that for each 1% increase in the vaccination rate, the number of excess deaths decreases by approximately 0.59.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can use the equation of the trend line:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = \\text{Intercept} + (\\text{Slope} \\times \\text{Vaccination Rate}) \\]\n\nFrom the plot, the intercept appears to be around 70 (estimated from the y-axis where the trend line intersects when the vaccination rate is 0).\n\nUsing the slope of -0.59 and a vaccination rate of 85%:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 70 + (-0.59 \\times 85) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 70 - 50.15 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 19.85 \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate number of excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85% is around 20."
