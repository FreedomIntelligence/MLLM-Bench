The head appears to have a bluish tint, particularly around the mouth area.\n\n2. **Body Shape**: The fish has a streamlined, elongated body that tapers towards the tail. The body shape is typical of many reef-dwelling fish.\n\n3. **Fins**: The pectoral fins (located on the sides) are yellowish in color. The dorsal fin (on the top) and the tail fin (caudal fin) are darker, almost black.\n\n4. **Mouth**: The mouth is prominent and appears to have a beak-like structure, which is characteristic of parrotfish. This beak is used to scrape algae and other organisms from the surfaces of coral and rocks.\n\n5. **Eyes**: The eyes are positioned on the sides of the head and are relatively small compared to the size of the head.\n\n6. **Habitat**: The background suggests an aquarium setting, but the fish's appearance is consistent with species found in coral reef environments.\n\nThese features suggest that the fish might belong to the parrotfish family, known for their bright colors and beak-like mouths."
