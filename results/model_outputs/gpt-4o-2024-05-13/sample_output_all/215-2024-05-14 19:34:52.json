    "criteria": "1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",

The datasets used are:\n\n- HadCRUT5 (1850-2023)\n- NOAAGlobalTemp (1850-2023)\n- Kadow et al. (1850-2023)\n- GISTEMP (1880-2023)\n- Berkeley Earth (1850-2023)\n- JRA-55 (1958-2023)\n- ERA5 (1940-2023)\n\nThe chart indicates that the global mean temperature has been increasing over time. The temperature anomaly is measured in degrees Celsius (°C), and the trend shows a significant rise, particularly from the mid-20th century onward. This implies that the Earth is experiencing a warming trend, which is consistent across multiple independent datasets. The increase in global mean temperature is a key indicator of global climate change."
