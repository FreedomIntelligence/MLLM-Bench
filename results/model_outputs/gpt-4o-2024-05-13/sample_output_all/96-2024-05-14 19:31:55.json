This particular piece showcases several distinctive features of Cubism:\n\n1. **Geometric Shapes and Fragmentation**: The subject is broken down into geometric shapes and fragmented forms, which is a hallmark of Cubism. The face and hands are depicted using angular and simplified shapes.\n\n2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Cubist works often depict subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. In this artwork, the face appears to be shown from both a frontal and a profile view at the same time.\n\n3. **Use of Color**: The use of bold, contrasting colors to delineate different planes and shapes is another characteristic of Cubism. The colors are not necessarily realistic but are used to emphasize the structure and form.\n\n4. **Flattened Space**: There is a lack of depth and perspective, creating a flattened, two-dimensional appearance. The forms are laid out on the canvas in a way that disregards traditional perspective.\n\n5. **Simplification and Abstraction**: The details are simplified and abstracted. The representation is more about the essence of the subject rather than a realistic portrayal.\n\nThese stylistic features strongly suggest that the artist of this piece is Pablo Picasso, who is one of the most well-known figures associated with the Cubist movement."
