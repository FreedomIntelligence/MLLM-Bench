Here are the noticeable changes:\n\n1. **Exposure and Lighting**: The right image has been edited to have a more balanced exposure. The shadows are lifted, and highlights are reduced, making the details in darker areas more visible and the bright areas less overexposed.\n  \n2. **Color Temperature**: The right image has a cooler color temperature compared to the warmer tones in the left image. This gives the right image a more neutral or slightly blueish hue.\n\n3. **Contrast and Clarity**: The right image has increased contrast and clarity, making the buildings and other details appear sharper and more defined.\n\n4. **Saturation**: The colors in the right image are slightly more saturated, making them appear more vivid.\n\n5. **Overall Tone**: The overall tone of the right image is more balanced and neutral, whereas the left image has a warmer, more golden tone due to the lighting conditions.\n\nThese edits enhance the visual appeal and detail of the photo."
