These devices are designed to clean large areas such as warehouses, factories, or commercial spaces by automatically sweeping up debris and dust from the floor. The brushes on the front and sides help to collect dirt and debris, which is then stored in an internal container for later disposal. The use case of this item is to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in large industrial or commercial environments efficiently and with minimal human intervention."
