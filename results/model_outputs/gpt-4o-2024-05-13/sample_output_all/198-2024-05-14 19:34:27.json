A normal temperature does not rule out the possibility of illness.\n\n- **Rest**: Ensure you get adequate rest, especially if you’re feeling under the weather.\n\n- **Seek Medical Advice if Needed**: If you start to feel worse or develop a fever (temperature above 37.5°C or 99.5°F), contact a healthcare professional for further guidance."
