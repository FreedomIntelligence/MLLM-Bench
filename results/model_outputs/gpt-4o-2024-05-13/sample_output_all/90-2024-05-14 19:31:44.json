The pages of the book extend into the distance, transforming into a winding path that leads further into the landscape. The man is bending over, seemingly reading or inspecting the text on the pages. There is a signpost next to the book that reads \"RIGHT PATH.\" The sky is partly cloudy with a warm, golden light suggesting either sunrise or sunset.\n\nA fitting Bible verse for this image might be Psalm 119:105 (NIV):\n\n\"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.\"\n\nThis verse aligns with the imagery of the book (representing the Bible or God's word) guiding the man along the right path."
