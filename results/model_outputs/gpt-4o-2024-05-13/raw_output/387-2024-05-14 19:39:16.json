The vehicle on the left seems to be moving towards the right, while the vehicle on the right is moving towards the left, and they are on a collision course.\n\nTo avoid a collision, the drivers can take the following actions:\n\n1. **Immediate Braking:** Both drivers should apply their brakes immediately to stop their vehicles as quickly as possible. Given the snowy conditions, they should brake gently to avoid skidding.\n\n2. **Steering Away:** If braking alone is not sufficient, they should also attempt to steer away from each other. The driver on the left should steer slightly to the left, and the driver on the right should steer slightly to the right.\n\n3. **Use of Hazard Lights:** Both drivers should turn on their hazard lights to alert other drivers of the emergency situation.\n\n4. **Maintain Control:** Given the slippery conditions, it is crucial for both drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Sudden movements should be avoided to prevent losing control.\n\n5. **Reduce Speed:** All drivers in the vicinity should reduce their speed and increase their following distance to provide more reaction time and space to maneuver.\n\n6. **Signal Intentions:** If possible, the drivers should signal their intentions (e.g., using turn signals) to communicate with each other and other drivers on the road.\n\nBy taking these actions, the drivers can increase their chances of avoiding a collision and ensuring their safety in these hazardous conditions."
