It is positioned near the center of the shelf, with two antennas on each side. To the left of the router, there is a decorative gold-colored geometric object. To the right, there is a glass container with a green plant inside. The shelf itself appears to be part of a larger piece of furniture, possibly a bookcase or a desk."
