The subject being taught appears to be mathematics, as evidenced by the mathematical notations and equations on the whiteboard and the screen. The students are seated and attentively listening to the teacher, who is standing at the front of the room and pointing at the board. This suggests that the educational activity taking place is a lecture or a class session focused on mathematics."
