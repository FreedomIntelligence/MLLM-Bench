The smaller bird is likely a host species, while the larger chick is likely a cuckoo. In brood parasitism, the parasitic bird (cuckoo) lays its eggs in the nest of the host bird, leaving the host bird to raise the parasitic chick as its own. The host bird is unaware that the chick is not its own and continues to feed and care for it, often at the expense of its own offspring. This type of relationship benefits the parasitic bird, as it does not have to expend resources to raise its young, while it is detrimental to the host bird."
