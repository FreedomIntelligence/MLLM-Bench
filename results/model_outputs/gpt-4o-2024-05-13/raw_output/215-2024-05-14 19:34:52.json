The datasets used are:\n\n- HadCRUT5 (1850-2023)\n- NOAAGlobalTemp (1850-2023)\n- Kadow et al. (1850-2023)\n- GISTEMP (1880-2023)\n- Berkeley Earth (1850-2023)\n- JRA-55 (1958-2023)\n- ERA5 (1940-2023)\n\nThe chart indicates that the global mean temperature has been increasing over time. The temperature anomaly is measured in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), and the trend shows a significant rise, particularly from the mid-20th century onward. This implies that the Earth is experiencing a warming trend, which is consistent across multiple independent datasets. The increase in global mean temperature is a key indicator of global climate change."
