Insulated containers are made to keep beverages hot or cold while preventing the outer surface from reaching extreme temperatures. \n\nIf this container is indeed insulated and filled with boiling water at 100\u00b0C, it is unlikely that the outer surface will become hot enough to scald someone. However, if the container is not insulated, the outer surface could become very hot and potentially cause burns or scalds upon contact.\n\nFor safety, it is always best to assume that the container might be hot and handle it with caution, especially if you are unsure about its insulation properties."
