Here are some impacts on structural and environmental health:\n\n### Structural Impact:\n1. **Building Damage:** Structures are severely damaged or completely destroyed, as seen with the collapsed and buried buildings.\n2. **Infrastructure:** Roads and bridges can be covered by ash and debris, making them impassable and requiring significant cleanup and repair efforts.\n3. **Utilities:** Power lines, water supply systems, and communication networks can be disrupted or destroyed, affecting the availability of essential services.\n\n### Environmental Impact:\n1. **Ash and Debris:** The landscape is covered with volcanic ash and debris, which can smother vegetation, contaminate water sources, and alter the local ecosystem.\n2. **Soil and Water Contamination:** Ash can lead to soil acidification and water contamination, adversely affecting agriculture and drinking water supplies.\n3. **Air Quality:** Airborne ash can reduce air quality, posing health risks to humans and animals, and can affect respiratory health.\n4. **Wildlife:** The local fauna can be displaced or harmed due to habitat destruction and contamination of food and water sources.\n\nOverall, a volcanic eruption can have devastating effects on both the built environment and the natural ecosystem, requiring extensive recovery and rehabilitation efforts."
