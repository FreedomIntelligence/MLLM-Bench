The spoon is positioned in front of the two cups. Here are the estimated bounding box coordinates for the spoon:\n\n- **Top-left corner (x1, y1):** (3100, 3100)\n- **Bottom-right corner (x2, y2):** (3550, 3550)\n\nThese coordinates are approximate and should be adjusted based on more precise measurements if needed."
