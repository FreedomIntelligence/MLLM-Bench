Star - Square = Square\n5. Square + Square = Star\n\nFrom the first two equations:\nCircle + Triangle = 8  (Equation 1)\nCircle - Triangle = 4  (Equation 2)\n\nAdding Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n(Circle + Triangle) + (Circle - Triangle) = 8 + 4\n2 * Circle = 12\nCircle = 6\n\nSubstitute Circle = 6 into Equation 1:\n6 + Triangle = 8\nTriangle = 2\n\nNow, let's use the third equation:\nStar + Square = 12  (Equation 3)\n\nAnd the fourth equation:\nStar - Square = Square  (Equation 4)\nStar = 2 * Square\n\nSubstitute Star = 2 * Square into Equation 3:\n2 * Square + Square = 12\n3 * Square = 12\nSquare = 4\n\nSubstitute Square = 4 into Star = 2 * Square:\nStar = 2 * 4\nStar = 8\n\nSo, the values are:\nStar = 8\nCircle = 6\nSquare = 4\nTriangle = 2"
