Here\u2019s the analysis:\n\n1. **Wooden Floor**: When a glass falls on a wooden floor, the hard and rigid surface does not absorb much of the impact energy. As a result, the glass is more likely to break due to the high impact force.\n\n2. **Padded/Foam Mat**: The beige and white interspersed area appears to be a padded or foam mat. This type of surface is designed to absorb impact and cushion falls. When the glass falls on this surface, the mat will absorb some of the impact energy, reducing the force exerted on the glass. This makes it less likely to break.\n\n**Conclusion**: The glass that falls on the wooden floor is more likely to break compared to the glass that falls on the padded/foam mat."
