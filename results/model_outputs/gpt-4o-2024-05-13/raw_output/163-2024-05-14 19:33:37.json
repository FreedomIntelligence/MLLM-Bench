                "content": "The topic of the speech is the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students. The speaker argues that these exams are essential and provides three reasons to support this viewpoint.\n\n### Rhetorical Codes Used in the Speech:\n\n1. **Hypophora**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is a rhetorical device where the speaker asks a question and then immediately answers it.\n   - **Example**: \"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college? What criteria will universities follow to admit students? Most likely, family conditions, and parents\u2019 social status will be taken into account.\"\n\n2. **Anaphora**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses.\n   - **Example**: \"For students with a better family background, they have money, they have parents with higher social status, they have better connections.\"\n\n3. **Antithesis**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas in balanced phrases or clauses.\n   - **Example**: \"These tests, however, force everyone to start from the same line in a race. Your family or money doesn't help here \u2013 it\u2019s all about how much you study and what you can do.\"\n\n4. **Pathos**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is an appeal to emotion.\n   - **Example**: \"You must have heard about stories that children from poor family studied very hard to get to top universities and changed their fate. For these students from poor family, these exams offer them the greatest chance to change their fates.\"\n\n5. **Ethos**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is an appeal to ethics, and it is a means of convincing someone of the character or credibility of the persuader.\n   - **Example**: \"Einstein once said that learning is more than remembering facts \u2013 it\u2019s about how to use your mind.\"\n\n6. **Metaphor**:\n   - **Explanation**: This is a figure of speech that involves an implicit comparison between two unlike things.\n   - **Example**: \"They\u2019re not just tests, but keys to the future.\"\n\nThese rhetorical devices enhance the persuasiveness of the speech by appealing to logic, credibility, and emotion, making a compelling case for the importance of college entrance exams."
