Service dogs are typically exempt from such restrictions due to the essential assistance they provide to their handlers. Denying entry to a person with a service dog could be considered discriminatory and a violation of laws protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States."
