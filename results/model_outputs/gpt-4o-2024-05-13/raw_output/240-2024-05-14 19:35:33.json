Let's compare their physical characteristics typical for their species and breeds, focusing on coat type and ear shape.\n\n1. **Jack Russell Terrier (left)**\n   - **Coat Type:** Jack Russell Terriers typically have a short, smooth, and dense coat. Some may have a rough or broken coat, which is wiry and longer.\n   - **Ear Shape:** They have small, V-shaped ears that usually fold forward.\n\n2. **Maine Coon (middle)**\n   - **Coat Type:** Maine Coons have a long, shaggy, and dense coat, which is well-suited for cold weather. Their fur is longer around the neck (forming a ruff), chest, and belly.\n   - **Ear Shape:** They have large, wide-set ears that often have tufts of fur at the tips, known as lynx tips.\n\n3. **Labrador Retriever (right)**\n   - **Coat Type:** Labrador Retrievers have a short, dense, and water-resistant double coat. The outer coat is straight and the undercoat is soft and weather-resistant.\n   - **Ear Shape:** They have medium-sized, pendant-shaped ears that hang close to the head.\n\nEach of these animals exhibits physical characteristics that are typical for their respective breeds, including distinct coat types and ear shapes."
