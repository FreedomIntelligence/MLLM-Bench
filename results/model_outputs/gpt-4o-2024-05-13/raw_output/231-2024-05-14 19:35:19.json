                "content": "The table provides data on night light intensity, average value per pixel, population density, urban percentage, and GDP per capita for the US, Brazil, and Madagascar. Here's an analysis of the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among these countries:\n\n### Night Light Intensity and GDP per Capita\n\n#### United States\n- **Night Light Intensity Distribution:**\n  - 0: 69.32%\n  - 1\u20132: 0.11%\n  - 3\u20135: 10.85%\n  - 6\u201310: 9.60%\n  - 11\u201320: 4.53%\n  - 21\u201362: 5.02%\n  - 63: 0.58%\n- **Average Value per Pixel:** 4.66\n- **GDP per Capita:** $33,582\n\n#### Brazil\n- **Night Light Intensity Distribution:**\n  - 0: 94.02%\n  - 1\u20132: 0.00%\n  - 3\u20135: 2.60%\n  - 6\u201310: 1.83%\n  - 11\u201320: 0.77%\n  - 21\u201362: 0.73%\n  - 63: 0.06%\n- **Average Value per Pixel:** 0.63\n- **GDP per Capita:** $3,760\n\n#### Madagascar\n- **Night Light Intensity Distribution:**\n  - 0: 99.73%\n  - 1\u20132: 0.01%\n  - 3\u20135: 0.15%\n  - 6\u201310: 0.06%\n  - 11\u201320: 0.03%\n  - 21\u201362: 0.03%\n  - 63: 0.00%\n- **Average Value per Pixel:** 0.02\n- **GDP per Capita:** $249\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **United States:**\n   - The US has the highest GDP per capita ($33,582) among the three countries.\n   - The distribution of night light intensity shows a significant proportion of higher intensity values (3\u201363), with an average value per pixel of 4.66.\n   - This indicates a strong correlation between higher night light intensity and higher GDP per capita.\n\n2. **Brazil:**\n   - Brazil's GDP per capita ($3,760) is significantly lower than that of the US.\n   - The majority of night light intensity is at 0 (94.02%), with very low percentages in higher intensity ranges.\n   - The average value per pixel is 0.63, indicating a lower correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita compared to the US.\n\n3. **Madagascar:**\n   - Madagascar has the lowest GDP per capita ($249).\n   - The night light intensity is almost entirely at 0 (99.73%), with negligible values in higher intensity ranges.\n   - The average value per pixel is 0.02, indicating a very weak correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita.\n\n### Conclusion\nThere is a clear positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the three countries listed. The US, with the highest GDP per capita, also has the highest night light intensity values. Brazil and Madagascar, with lower GDP per capita, show lower night light intensity values. This suggests that higher economic activity, as represented by GDP per capita, is associated with higher night light intensity."
