Mycena species are small, with conical or bell-shaped caps, and they often grow in clusters on decaying wood or forest debris.\n\nHowever, identifying mushrooms solely based on an image can be challenging and potentially inaccurate. Many mushrooms have look-alikes that can be toxic or inedible. Some species of Mycena are known to be toxic, while others are considered inedible due to their small size or lack of substantial flavor.\n\nFor safety reasons, it is crucial to consult a local expert or mycologist, or refer to a comprehensive field guide when identifying and determining the edibility of wild mushrooms. Never consume wild mushrooms unless you are absolutely certain of their identity and edibility."
