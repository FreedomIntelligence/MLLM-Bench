Cormorant fishing is a traditional method of fishing in which fishermen use trained cormorants to catch fish. The attire, the bamboo raft, and the presence of cormorants perched on the pole he is carrying are all indicative of this ancient practice, which is still practiced in some parts of China and Japan."
