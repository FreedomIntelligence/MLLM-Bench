The signs read \"END RACISM\" and \"RACISM IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY,\" which are calls for social justice and equality. These messages advocate for ending racial discrimination and promoting human rights, which are ethical demands rooted in the principles of fairness, justice, and the inherent dignity of all individuals. The protest or demonstration setting suggests that the people are actively voicing their stance against racism, highlighting the moral imperative to address and combat racial injustices in society."
