Using the properties of exponents: \\( a^m \\div a^n = a^{m-n} \\).\n\n2. \\( (0.0001)^0 = (100000)^0 \\)\n   - This equation is correct. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1: \\( x^0 = 1 \\) for \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\n3. \\( m^3 \\div m^3 = m^{3-3} = m^0 = 1 \\)\n   - This equation is correct. Using the properties of exponents: \\( m^m \\div m^n = m^{m-n} \\) and \\( m^0 = 1 \\) for \\( m \\neq 0 \\).\n\n4. \\( 8x^{10} \\div 2x^2 = 6x^8 \\)\n   - This equation is incorrect. Simplify the left side:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8x^{10}}{2x^2} = 4x^{10-2} = 4x^8\n     \\]\n     The correct equation should be \\( 8x^{10} \\div 2x^2 = 4x^8 \\).\n\n5. \\( (x^n)^2 \\div x^n = x^2 \\)\n   - This equation is correct. Simplify the left side:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(x^n)^2}{x^n} = \\frac{x^{2n}}{x^n} = x^{2n-n} = x^n\n     \\]\n     The correct equation should be \\( (x^n)^2 \\div x^n = x^n \\).\n\nSo, out of the five equations, four are correct."
