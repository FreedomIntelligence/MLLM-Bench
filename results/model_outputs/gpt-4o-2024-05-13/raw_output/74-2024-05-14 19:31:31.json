The matador's costume, known as the \"traje de luces\" (suit of lights), is elaborate and symbolic.\n\n3. **Art Form**: Many proponents view bullfighting as an art form, emphasizing the grace, precision, and bravery required to perform the movements and rituals.\n\n4. **Controversy**: Bullfighting is highly controversial due to animal rights concerns. Critics argue that it is a cruel and inhumane practice, leading to significant opposition and calls for bans in various regions.\n\n5. **Cultural Identity**: For many, bullfighting is a significant aspect of cultural identity and national pride, reflecting historical and social values.\n\nDespite its cultural importance, bullfighting faces increasing scrutiny and legal challenges in many parts of the world, with some regions banning the practice altogether."
