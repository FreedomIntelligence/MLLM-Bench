The presence of two lines on the test kit has the following interpretation:\n\n- The \"C\" line is the control line. It indicates that the test is working correctly. If this line does not appear, the test is invalid.\n- The \"T\" line is the test line. If this line appears, it indicates a positive result for the presence of COVID-19 antigens.\n\nIn the image, both the \"C\" and \"T\" lines are visible, indicating a positive result for COVID-19."
