Since \\(PQR\\) and \\(PUS\\) are both equilateral triangles, we can use properties of equilateral triangles and congruence postulates.\n\n1. **Given Information:**\n   - \\(PQR\\) and \\(PUS\\) are both equilateral triangles.\n   - Equilateral triangles have all sides equal and all angles equal to \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Identifying Congruent Parts:**\n   - In \\(PQR\\), all sides \\(PQ = QR = RP\\).\n   - In \\(PUS\\), all sides \\(PU = US = SP\\).\n\n3. **Angles:**\n   - Since \\(PQR\\) and \\(PUS\\) are equilateral, \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle QRP = \\angle RPQ = 60^\\circ\\).\n   - Similarly, \\(\\angle PUS = \\angle USP = \\angle SPU = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Shared Side:**\n   - Both triangles \\(PUQ\\) and \\(PSR\\) share the side \\(PQ\\).\n\n5. **Congruence by SAS (Side-Angle-Side):**\n   - In \\(\\triangle PUQ\\) and \\(\\triangle PSR\\):\n     - \\(PQ = PR\\) (sides of the equilateral triangle \\(PQR\\)).\n     - \\(\\angle UPQ = \\angle SPR = 60^\\circ\\) (angles of the equilateral triangles).\n     - \\(PU = PS\\) (sides of the equilateral triangle \\(PUS\\)).\n\nBy the SAS postulate (Side-Angle-Side), since two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, \\(\\triangle PUQ \\cong \\triangle PSR\\).\n\nTherefore, we have proven that \\(\\triangle PUQ\\) is congruent to \\(\\triangle PSR\\)."
