Here are the likely methods used to turn the ingredients into these dishes:\n\n1. **Grilling**: The skewered items, which appear to be kebabs, are likely prepared by grilling. This involves cooking the food on a grill over direct heat, often on skewers.\n\n2. **Frying**: The items that look crispy and golden brown are probably deep-fried. This involves submerging the food in hot oil until it becomes crispy and cooked through.\n\n3. **Pan-Frying or Shallow Frying**: The flat, round items could be patties or cutlets that are pan-fried or shallow-fried. This method involves cooking the food in a small amount of oil in a pan.\n\n4. **Assembling Sandwiches**: The sandwiches with various fillings (possibly meat, vegetables, or other ingredients) are assembled by placing the prepared fillings between slices of bread or buns. The fillings themselves could be cooked using various methods such as frying, grilling, or roasting.\n\nEach of these methods imparts different textures and flavors to the food, making street food a diverse and flavorful experience."
