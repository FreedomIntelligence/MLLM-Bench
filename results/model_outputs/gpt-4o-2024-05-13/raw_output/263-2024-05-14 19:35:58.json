An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, typically triggered by natural events such as heavy snowfall, rapid temperature changes, or disturbances like loud noises or human activity. The vehicle appears to be driving away from the cascading snow, indicating it might have been caught in or is trying to escape from the avalanche. Avalanches are highly dangerous and can occur in mountainous regions, especially during or after significant snowfall."
