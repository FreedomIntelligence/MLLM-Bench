This is reflected through several elements:\n\n1. **Minimalist Design**: The room features clean lines and a lack of clutter, which is characteristic of modern design.\n2. **Wall Paneling**: The vertical wooden slats on the wall add texture and a modern aesthetic.\n3. **Geometric Shapes**: The circular wall art and the round pendant light add geometric interest, which is common in contemporary design.\n4. **Neutral Color Palette**: The use of neutral colors like white, brown, and beige creates a calm and sophisticated look.\n5. **Modern Lighting**: The pendant light with a simple, sleek design is a hallmark of modern decor.\n6. **Functional Furniture**: The furniture, such as the bed and the side table, is functional and has a minimalist design, which is typical of modern interiors.\n\nThese elements collectively contribute to the modern or contemporary style of the room."
