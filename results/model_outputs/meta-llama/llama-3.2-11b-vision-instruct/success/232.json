The schedule outlines various flights with their corresponding aircraft types.\n\n**Aircraft Types for Domestic Flights**\n\nUpon examining the schedule, we can identify the following aircraft types used for domestic flights:\n\n*   **A320**: 4 flights\n*   **ATR**: 7 flights\n*   **B738**: 2 flights\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, it is evident that the **ATR** is the most commonly used aircraft type for domestic flights, with a total of 7 flights. This indicates that the ATR is the preferred choice for domestic operations within the region.",
