In return, the warthog offers the oxpecker protection from predators and a safe place to nest. This interaction benefits both organisms, as the oxpecker gets a food source and the warthog gets rid of parasites that could harm it.\n\n*Answer*: The oxpecker and warthog have a mutualistic relationship, where both organisms benefit from each other's presence.",
