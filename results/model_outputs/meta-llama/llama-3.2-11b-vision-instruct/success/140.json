    "answer": "The meme is a humorous take on the common stereotype that people who hate dogs are often seen as being aggressive or violent. The image shows a man and woman in a car, with the woman saying \"Oh look at that dog\" and the man responding \"I hate dogs.\" The punchline comes when the man is shown driving a car with a large dog in the passenger seat, and the woman is visibly upset in the backseat. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical reaction to seeing a dog, and the absurdity of the situation.\n\nThe type of humor employed in this meme is irony, as it subverts the expectation of how someone who hates dogs would react to seeing one. It also uses exaggeration, as the man's hatred of dogs is taken to an extreme level by having him drive a car with a large dog in the passenger seat. Overall, the meme uses a lighthearted and playful approach to poke fun at the stereotype of dog haters.",
