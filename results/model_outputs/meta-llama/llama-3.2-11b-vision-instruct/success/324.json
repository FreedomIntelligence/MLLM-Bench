    "answer": "The image is blurry because the camera was moving while taking the picture. This can cause a range of issues, including:\n\n* Motion blur: The movement of the camera creates a blur effect on the image, making it difficult to discern details.\n* Lack of sharpness: The blur can also affect the sharpness of the image, making it appear soft or fuzzy.\n* Loss of detail: The motion blur can cause important details in the image to be lost, such as text or fine features.\n* Unstable composition: The blur can also affect the composition of the image, making it difficult to achieve a stable and balanced arrangement of elements.\n\nTo avoid these issues, it's important to use a tripod or other stabilizing device when taking pictures, especially in low-light conditions or when moving the camera. Additionally, using a faster shutter speed or a higher ISO can help to reduce motion blur and improve the overall quality of the image.",
