    "answer": "**Step 1: Analyze the scatter plot**\n\nThe scatter plot shows the relationship between vaccination rate and excess deaths. The x-axis represents the vaccination rate for the state, ranging from 0 to 90%. The y-axis represents the excess deaths, ranging from 0 to 60. The data points are scattered across the plot, but there is a general downward trend indicating that as the vaccination rate increases, the excess deaths decrease.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the correlation coefficient**\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r-value) is -0.47, which indicates a negative correlation between vaccination rate and excess deaths. This means that as the vaccination rate increases, the excess deaths decrease.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the p-value**\n\nThe p-value is 0.0004, which is less than 0.05. This indicates that the correlation between vaccination rate and excess deaths is statistically significant.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the R-squared value**\n\nThe R-squared value is 0.225, which indicates that about 22.5% of the variation in excess deaths can be explained by the variation in vaccination rate.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%**\n\nUsing the regression line, we can estimate the excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%. The regression line passes through the point (70, 40). Since the vaccination rate of 85% is 15% above 70, we can estimate the excess deaths by moving 15% up the y-axis. This would result in an estimated excess death rate of approximately 30.\n\n**Answer:** *30*",
