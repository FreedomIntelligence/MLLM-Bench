    "answer": "**Calculating the Variance of a 2-Stock Portfolio**\n\nTo calculate the variance of a 2-stock portfolio, we can use the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{p}^2 = \\sigma_{p1}^2 + \\sigma_{p2}^2 + 2 \\cdot \\text{Cov}(R_{p1}, R_{p2})\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $\\sigma_{p}^2$ is the variance of the portfolio\n* $\\sigma_{p1}^2$ and $\\sigma_{p2}^2$ are the variances of the individual stocks\n* $\\text{Cov}(R_{p1}, R_{p2})$ is the covariance between the two stocks\n\nThis equation is derived from the formula for the variance of a portfolio, which takes into account the individual variances of the stocks and their covariance.\n\n**Example Calculation**\n\nLet's say we have two stocks with the following characteristics:\n\n* Stock 1:\n\t+ Variance: 0.05\n\t+ Covariance with Stock 2: 0.01\n* Stock 2:\n\t+ Variance: 0.03\n\t+ Covariance with Stock 1: 0.01\n\nUsing the equation above, we can calculate the variance of the portfolio as follows:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{p}^2 = 0.05 + 0.03 + 2 \\cdot 0.01 = 0.09\n$$\n\nTherefore, the variance of the 2-stock portfolio is 0.09.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the equation for calculating the variance of a 2-stock portfolio is:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{p}^2 = \\sigma_{p1}^2 + \\sigma_{p2}^2 + 2 \\cdot \\text{Cov}(R_{p1}, R_{p2})\n$$\n\nThis equation provides a simple and effective way to calculate the variance of a portfolio composed of two stocks.",
