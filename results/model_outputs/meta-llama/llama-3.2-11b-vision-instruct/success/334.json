The damage is likely due to over-tightening or excessive force during play.\n\n**Repair Options:**\n\n* **Grip Replacement**: Replace the damaged grip with a new one, ensuring proper fitting and secure fastening to prevent further damage.\n* **Handle Repair**: Secure the exposed handle with a strong adhesive, such as epoxy or super glue, and wrap the handle with a protective tape or sleeve to prevent further damage.\n* **Racquet Replacement**: If the damage is extensive, consider replacing the racquet entirely, as it may be more cost-effective than attempting to repair it.\n\n**Preventing Future Damage:**\n\n* Regularly inspect the racquet for signs of wear and tear.\n* Avoid over-tightening the grip.\n* Use a racquet with a durable and comfortable grip.\n* Store the racquet properly to prevent damage from impact or scratches.",
