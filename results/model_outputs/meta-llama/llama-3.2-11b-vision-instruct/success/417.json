    "answer": "The visible components of the watch mechanism include:\n\n* Gears: These are the toothed wheels that transmit motion and power to other parts of the watch. The gears are typically made of metal and are designed to mesh together smoothly, allowing for efficient transmission of power.\n* Jewels: These are small, synthetic rubies or sapphires that are used to reduce friction between moving parts. They are typically located at the pivot points of the gears and are designed to withstand the high stresses and loads associated with watch movement.\n* Springs: These are flexible metal components that store energy and release it as the watch winds down. The springs are typically located near the balance wheel and are designed to provide a consistent release of energy over time.\n* Plates: These are flat, metal components that provide a base for the gears and other mechanical components. The plates are typically made of a durable metal alloy and are designed to withstand the stresses and loads associated with watch movement.\n\nOverall, the visible components of the watch mechanism work together to provide a reliable and accurate timekeeping system. The gears transmit power, the jewels reduce friction, the springs store energy, and the plates provide a base for the mechanism.",
