    "answer": "The image shows a variety of containers and utensils, but none of them appear to be designed to hold a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand. The largest container in the image is a white plastic cup, which is still much smaller than a sandwich of that size. The other containers are even smaller, and are likely intended for holding small amounts of food or drinks, such as yogurt or soup. Therefore, it is not possible to select a container from the picture that would be suitable for packing a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand.",
