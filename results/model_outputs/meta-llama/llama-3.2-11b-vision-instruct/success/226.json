    "answer": "**Step 1: Identify the species in the food web.**\n\nThe food web includes the following species:\n\n*   Red-tailed hawk\n*   Fox\n*   Mouse\n*   Detritus feeders (insects and worms)\n*   Decomposers (fungi and bacteria)\n*   Detritus (dead plants and animals)\n*   Rabbit\n*   Squirrel\n*   Scavengers (vulture)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the feeding relationships between species.**\n\nThe feeding relationships are as follows:\n\n*   Red-tailed hawk eats fox, mouse, and detritus feeders.\n*   Fox eats rabbit, squirrel, and detritus feeders.\n*   Mouse eats detritus feeders.\n*   Detritus feeders eat detritus.\n*   Decomposers break down detritus into nutrients.\n*   Detritus feeders eat decomposers.\n*   Detritus feeders eat detritus.\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential cascade effects if one species were to become extinct.**\n\nIf one species were to become extinct, it could have a ripple effect throughout the entire food web. For example, if the red-tailed hawk were to become extinct, the fox population might increase because there would be no natural predator to control its numbers. This could lead to overgrazing and degradation of the habitat, which could have negative impacts on other species such as the rabbit and squirrel.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the complex interdependencies between species in this food web and identify any potential cascade effects if one species were to become extinct.**\n\nThe food web is complex and interconnected, with many species relying on each other for survival. If one species were to become extinct, it could have a significant impact on the entire ecosystem. It is important to consider these potential cascade effects when making decisions about conservation and management of natural resources.\n\n**Answer**: The food web is complex and interconnected, with many species relying on each other for survival. If one species were to become extinct, it could have a significant impact on the entire ecosystem.
