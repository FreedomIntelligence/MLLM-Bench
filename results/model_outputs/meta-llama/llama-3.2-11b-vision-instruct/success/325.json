The exterior walls are illuminated by a string of yellow lights, while the roof is aglow with a single row of lights. A tree, also decorated with yellow lights, stands in front of the house, adding to the festive ambiance. The house's surroundings are characterized by a few parked cars and a blue trash can, set against a dark sky.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is one of tranquility and festivity, evoking a sense of a peaceful winter evening.",
