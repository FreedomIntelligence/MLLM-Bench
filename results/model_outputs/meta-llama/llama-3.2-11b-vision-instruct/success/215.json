    "criteria": "1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",

    "answer": "This chart illustrates the global mean temperature compared to the 1850-1900 average, showing a steady increase over time. The chart includes data from various sources such as HadCRUT5, NOAA GlobalTemp, Kadow et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5. Notably, all data sets exhibit a similar upward trend, with the most recent data points (2020 or later) displaying a significant increase in temperature. This suggests that the planet is experiencing a rapid warming trend, which is consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change. The chart also highlights the importance of considering multiple data sources when analyzing global temperature trends, as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Overall, this chart implies that the Earth's temperature is rising at an alarming rate, and urgent action is necessary to mitigate its effects.",
