The gaze is fixed on something in the distance.\n\n**Behavioral Interpretation**\n\n*   **Aggression**: The gorilla's facial expression and gaze could suggest aggression or defensiveness. The narrowed eyes and open mouth may indicate that the gorilla is feeling threatened or preparing to defend itself.\n*   **Curiosity**: Alternatively, the gorilla's gaze could be a sign of curiosity. The fixed stare may indicate that the gorilla is interested in something in the distance and is trying to learn more about it.\n*   **Attention**: The gorilla's expression and gaze could also suggest attention. The focused stare may indicate that the gorilla is paying close attention to something or someone, possibly indicating that it is engaged in a social interaction or is trying to communicate with someone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the gorilla's facial expression and gaze, it is difficult to determine its current state or intentions with certainty. However, the narrowed eyes and open mouth could suggest aggression or defensiveness, while the fixed stare could indicate curiosity or attention.",
