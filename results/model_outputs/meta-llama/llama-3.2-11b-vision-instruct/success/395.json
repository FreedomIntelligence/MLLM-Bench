    "answer": "The evolution of aircraft design has led to significant improvements in safety and passenger experience. Here are the key changes:\n\n**Safety:**\n\n*   **Airframe strength:** The Wright Flyer's wooden structure was prone to cracking and breaking. Modern aircraft use lightweight yet incredibly strong materials like carbon fiber.\n*   **Control systems:** The Wright Flyer's wing warping system was replaced by more efficient control systems, such as ailerons and elevators.\n*   **Engine reliability:** Early engines were unreliable and prone to failure. Modern engines are much more reliable and efficient.\n*   **Avionics:** The introduction of avionics has significantly improved safety by providing pilots with real-time flight data and navigation information.\n\n**Passenger Experience:**\n\n*   **Comfort:** The Wright Flyer was a rickety, open-cockpit aircraft. Modern aircraft offer much greater comfort, with pressurized cabins, comfortable seating, and amenities like in-flight entertainment.\n*   **Noise reduction:** Early aircraft were very loud. Modern aircraft have noise-reducing features like soundproofing and noise-cancelling technology.\n*   **Cabin pressure:** The Wright Flyer's cabin was not pressurized, leading to altitude sickness. Modern aircraft maintain a comfortable cabin pressure.\n*   **In-flight services:** Modern aircraft offer a range of in-flight services, including food and beverage, Wi-Fi, and entertainment options.\n\n**Future Predictions:**\n\n*   **Electric propulsion:** Electric propulsion systems will become more prevalent, offering greater efficiency and reduced noise.\n*   **Advanced materials:** New materials will continue to be developed, leading to even lighter and stronger aircraft.\n*   **Autonomous systems:** Autonomous systems will become more common, improving safety and reducing pilot workload.\n*   **Sustainable aviation fuels:** Sustainable aviation fuels will replace traditional fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.\n\nOverall, the future of aircraft design will prioritize sustainability, efficiency, and passenger comfort, leading to a safer and more enjoyable travel experience.",
