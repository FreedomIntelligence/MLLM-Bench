The matador's primary goal is to outmaneuver the bull and ultimately kill it with a sword.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nBullfighting holds significant cultural importance in Spain, where it has been a part of the country's heritage for centuries. It is often seen as a symbol of Spanish identity and tradition, and is deeply rooted in the country's history and folklore.\n\n**Controversy and Criticism**\n\nHowever, bullfighting is also widely criticized for its perceived cruelty and inhumane treatment of animals.

Despite this, bullfighting remains a popular event in many parts of the country, and its cultural significance continues to be debated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cultural significance of bullfighting in Spain is complex and multifaceted, reflecting both the country's rich history and its ongoing debates about animal welfare.",
