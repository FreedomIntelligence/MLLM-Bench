    "answer": "The CT scan that needs a redo is **(c)**. This is because it has a significant amount of motion artifact, which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and poor image quality. Motion artifact occurs when there is movement during the scanning process, causing the images to appear blurry or distorted. In this case, the patient's movement during the scan resulted in a suboptimal image quality, making it difficult to interpret the results accurately. Therefore, a redo scan would be necessary to obtain a clearer and more reliable image.",
