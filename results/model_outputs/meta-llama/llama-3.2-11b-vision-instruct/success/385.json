By leaping into the air, the fox is able to cover a greater distance and surprise its prey, increasing its chances of catching them.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of this action is to catch prey for food. Foxes are carnivores and need to eat meat to survive. They hunt small rodents, birds, and other small animals to feed themselves and their young. In this case, the fox is using its agility and speed to catch its prey off guard, making it easier to catch.",
