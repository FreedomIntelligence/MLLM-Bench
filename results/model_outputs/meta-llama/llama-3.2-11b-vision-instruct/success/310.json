    "answer": "**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to prove that triangle $PUQ$ is congruent to triangle $PSR$. To do this, we need to show that the two triangles have the same shape and size.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the given information**\n\nWe are given that triangles $PQR$ and $PUS$ are both equilateral. This means that all three sides of each triangle are equal in length.\n\n**Step 3: Find the area of triangle $ABC$**\n\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is given as $1950\\text{ cm}^2$. We can use this information to find the length of side $AB$, which is also the base of triangle $ABC$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the length of side $AB$**\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle, we can set up an equation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times 72 = 1950$$\n\nSolving for $AB$, we get:\n\n$$AB = \\frac{2 \\times 1950}{72} = 54\\text{ cm}$$\n\n**Step 5: Find the length of side $PQ$**\n\nSince triangle $PQR$ is equilateral, all three sides are equal in length. Therefore, $PQ = PR = QR = 54\\text{ cm}$.\n\n**Step 6: Find the length of side $PS$**\n\nSince triangle $PUS$ is equilateral, all three sides are equal in length. Therefore, $PS = PU = US = 54\\text{ cm}$.\n\n**Step 7: Prove that triangle $PUQ$ is congruent to triangle $PSR$**\n\nTo prove that triangle $PUQ$ is congruent to triangle $PSR$, we need to show that they have the same shape and size. Since both triangles have two sides of equal length ($PQ = PS$ and $UQ = SR$), we can conclude that they are congruent.\n\n**Answer**\n\n*Answer*: Triangle $PUQ$ is congruent to triangle $PSR$.",
