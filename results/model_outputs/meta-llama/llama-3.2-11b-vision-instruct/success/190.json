The crown-rump length (CRL) is the distance from the top of the head (crown) to the buttocks (rump). In this image, the CRL appears to be approximately 5.5 cm.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the gestational age based on the CRL.**\n\nTo determine the gestational age, we need to refer to standard growth charts for fetuses. According to these charts, a CRL of 5.5 cm corresponds to a gestational age of around 12-13 weeks.\n\n**Answer:** 12-13 weeks",
