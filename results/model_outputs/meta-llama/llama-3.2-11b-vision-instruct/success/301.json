    "answer": "To determine which piece to place in the second row and first column, we need to analyze the given information. The puzzle is represented as:\n\n1 apple + 3 bananas = 2 strawberries\n\nWe are asked to solve for the missing piece that equals 7. \n\nLooking at the remaining pieces, we have:\n\n- 1 strawberry\n- 2 bananas\n- 3 apples\n\nSince the equation involves apples and bananas, we can focus on those options. The equation states that 1 apple + 3 bananas = 2 strawberries. This means that the value of one apple is equivalent to the value of three bananas. Therefore, if we place the piece with 3 bananas in the second row and first column, it would be a valid solution.\n\n**Answer:** 3 bananas",
