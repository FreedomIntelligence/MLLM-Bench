    "answer": "The container in the top left corner of the picture is a Starbucks tumbler, which is designed to keep drinks hot or cold for hours. It is made of double-walled insulation that helps to keep the temperature of the drink inside. \n\nIf the tumbler was filled with boiling water at 100째C, it would be very hot to the touch and could cause burns if someone were to hold it without protection. However, the tumbler is designed to keep the temperature of the drink inside, so it is unlikely that the outside of the tumbler would be hot enough to cause burns. \n\nIt is important to note that even if the tumbler is not hot to the touch, the contents of the tumbler could still be very hot and could cause burns if someone were to drink from it without waiting for it to cool down. It is always important to exercise caution when handling hot beverages and to wait for them to cool down before consuming them.",
