    "answer": "The image presents a series of mathematical equations, each involving geometric shapes such as circles, triangles, squares, and stars. The equations are designed to be solved by applying basic arithmetic operations and recognizing patterns.\n\n**Equation 1:**\nThe first equation reads \"+ = 8.\" To solve this, we need to find two numbers that add up to 8. Given the presence of a circle and a triangle, it is reasonable to assume that the two numbers are 3 (represented by the circle) and 5 (represented by the triangle), as 3 + 5 = 8.\n\n**Equation 2:**\nThe second equation is \"- = 4.\" Similar to the first equation, we need to find two numbers that subtract to 4. Considering the shapes involved, a plausible solution is 7 (represented by the circle) and 3 (represented by the triangle), as 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n**Equation 3:**\nThe third equation is \"+ = 12.\" To solve this, we must identify two numbers that add up to 12. Given the shapes, a possible solution is 6 (represented by the star) and 6 (represented by the square), as 6 + 6 = 12.\n\n**Equation 4:**\nThe fourth equation is \"- = ?.\" This equation involves a square and a star. To solve it, we need to find two numbers that subtract to the unknown value. A possible solution is 9 (represented by the square) and 3 (represented by the star), as 9 - 3 = 6.\n\n**Equation 5:**\nThe fifth equation is \"+ = ?.\" This equation involves a circle and a triangle. To solve it, we need to find two numbers that add up to the unknown value. A possible solution is 4 (represented by the circle) and 4 (represented by the triangle), as 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the given equations and applying basic arithmetic operations, we can determine the values for the question marks in the image.\n\n*Answer*: 6, 8",
