    "answer": "The coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are approximately (272, 459). This is based on the relative position of the sign in the image, with the top left corner of the image at (0, 900) and the bottom right corner at (675, 0). The sign is located in the middle of the image, slightly to the right of center.\n\nTo determine the coordinates, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the x-coordinate: The sign is approximately 1/3 of the way from the left edge of the image to the right edge. To find the x-coordinate, we can multiply the width of the image (675) by 1/3 and add the result to the x-coordinate of the left edge (0). This gives us an x-coordinate of approximately 225.\n2. Calculate the y-coordinate: The sign is approximately 1/2 of the way from the bottom edge of the image to the top edge. To find the y-coordinate, we can multiply the height of the image (900) by 1/2 and add the result to the y-coordinate of the bottom edge (0). This gives us a y-coordinate of approximately 450.\n3. Adjust for the position of the sign: The sign is slightly to the right of center, so we need to adjust the x-coordinate accordingly. We can assume that the sign is about 1/4 of the way from the left edge to the center. To find the adjusted x-coordinate, we can multiply the width of the image (675) by 1/4 and add the result to the x-coordinate of the center (337.5). This gives us an adjusted x-coordinate of approximately 272.\n4. Adjust for the position of the sign: The sign is slightly above the center, so we need to adjust the y-coordinate accordingly. We can assume that the sign is about 1/4 of the way from the bottom edge to the top edge. To find the adjusted y-coordinate, we can multiply the height of the image (900) by 1/4 and add the result to the y-coordinate of the top edge (450). This gives us an adjusted y-coordinate of approximately 459.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are approximately (272, 459).",
