    "answer": "The white objects in the image are small, ceramic or porcelain figurines of penguins. They are likely decorative items, possibly used as paperweights or desk ornaments. The penguins are arranged in a group on a table, with one black penguin standing out among them. The penguins have distinctive features such as orange beaks and feet, blue eyes, and red scarves. They appear to be hand-painted and have a glossy finish. The presence of the penguins on the table suggests that they may be part of a larger collection or display. Overall, the image showcases a charming and whimsical arrangement of penguin figurines, adding a touch of personality to the table setting.",
