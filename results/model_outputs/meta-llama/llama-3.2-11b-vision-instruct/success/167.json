We should continue straight through this hallway.\n4. **Turn right**: At the end of the hallway, we will reach a staircase leading up to the second floor. We should turn right and go up the stairs.\n5. **Exit the building**: Once we reach the top of the stairs, we will find an emergency exit door marked with a green exit sign and a green arrow pointing outside. This is the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\n\nBy following these steps, we can quickly and safely reach the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.",
