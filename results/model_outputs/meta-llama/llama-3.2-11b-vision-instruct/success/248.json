However, the Australian flag has a more muted tone, while the United States flag has a brighter, more vibrant color scheme.\n* The iconography is also different, with the United States flag featuring a representation of the original colonies and the fifty states, while the Australian flag features the Southern Cross constellation and the Union Jack.\n\nIn terms of their symbolic meanings, color schemes, and iconography, the two flags are distinct and reflect the unique histories and cultures of their respective countries.
