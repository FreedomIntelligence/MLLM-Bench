    "answer": "The teacher is likely to correct the student's technique by adjusting the position of their left hand and fingers on the neck of the violin, and ensuring that their right hand is properly placed to strike the strings. The teacher may also advise the student to focus on their bowing technique, such as maintaining a consistent bow speed and pressure. After correcting the student's technique, the teacher will likely transition them to a new set of notes or scales that require the same level of precision and control, such as scales in different keys or more complex melodies.",
