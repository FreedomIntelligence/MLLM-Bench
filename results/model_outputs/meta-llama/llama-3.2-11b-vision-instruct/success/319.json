    "answer": "**Step 1: Identify the type of integral.**\n\nThe given expression is a definite integral, which is a mathematical operation that calculates the area under a curve between two points.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limits of integration.**\n\nThe limits of integration are not explicitly provided in the question, but we can infer them from the context. Since the integral is a definite integral, it must have specific upper and lower bounds.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the integral using the appropriate method.**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the method of substitution or integration by parts. However, without the explicit limits of integration, we cannot determine the exact value of the integral.\n\n**Step 4: Provide a general solution.**\n\nSince we cannot determine the exact value of the integral without the limits of integration, we can provide a general solution in terms of the variable x.\n\n**Answer:** $\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{2x}{(x+1)(x^2+1)} dx$\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The integral can be evaluated using the method of partial fractions or substitution.\n*   The limits of integration (a and b) must be specified to obtain a specific value for the integral.\n*   Without the limits of integration, the integral remains undefined.",
