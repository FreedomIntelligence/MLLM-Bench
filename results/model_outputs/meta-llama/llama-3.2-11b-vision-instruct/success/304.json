    "answer": "The vacant space on the far right of the box is a triangular hole. The block that would fit perfectly into this space is the orange block, which is shaped like a triangle. This block is one of the seven blocks that come with the toy and is designed to fit into the corresponding triangular hole on the box. The orange block is a sturdy, solid piece of wood that is painted orange, making it easy to distinguish from the other blocks. Its triangular shape allows it to fit snugly into the hole, providing a secure fit and preventing it from falling out. Overall, the orange block is a great choice for filling the vacant space on the far right of the box.",
