    "answer": "The image is a humorous meme that contrasts the appearance of being a parent with the actual experience. The left image shows a baby sleeping peacefully, while the right image depicts a parent's hands holding a toy and a remote control, implying that they are busy entertaining the child. The caption \"How it looks\" and \"How it feels\" highlights the disparity between the idealized perception of parenthood and the reality of managing a child's needs.\n\nThe humor in this meme lies in its relatability to many parents who can identify with the feeling of being overwhelmed by their child's demands. The use of the phrase \"How it looks\" and \"How it feels\" adds to the comedic effect, as it implies that the parent is trying to present a perfect image of themselves while secretly struggling to cope with the challenges of parenthood. Overall, the meme pokes fun at the idea that parents often have to juggle multiple responsibilities simultaneously, and that even when everything appears calm on the surface, there may be chaos brewing beneath the surface.",
