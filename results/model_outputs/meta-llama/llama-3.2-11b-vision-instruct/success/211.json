    "answer": "The map shows the average humidity levels in different regions of China. The legend indicates that the darker shades of blue represent higher humidity levels, ranging from 75-82% to 38-52%. \n\nTo determine which parts of the map have the greatest humidity, we need to look for the darkest shades of blue, which correspond to the highest humidity levels. These areas are primarily located in the southern and southeastern parts of China, including:\n\n*   The provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan in the south\n*   The provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang in the southeast\n*   The provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai in the eastern coastal region\n\nThese regions are characterized by high humidity levels throughout the year, with an average relative humidity of 75-82%. In contrast, the northern and western parts of China, including the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, and Gansu, have lower humidity levels, ranging from 38-52%.",
