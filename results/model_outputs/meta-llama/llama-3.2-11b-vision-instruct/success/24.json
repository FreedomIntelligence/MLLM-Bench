    "answer": "The swimmer's hands are positioned in a way that suggests they are using the butterfly stroke. In the butterfly stroke, the hands enter the water with the palms facing downwards and the fingers together, then pull back towards the hips with the elbows high and the hands in a wide position. The head is also positioned in a way that suggests the butterfly stroke, with the nose and mouth out of the water and the head tilted upwards. The body position, with the hips and shoulders aligned and the legs in a frog-like position, also suggests the butterfly stroke.\n\n*Answer*: Butterfly",
