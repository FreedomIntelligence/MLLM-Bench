These figurines are likely used as game pieces in a board game, possibly a variation of checkers or a similar strategy game. Their functionality is to represent the player's units or pieces in the game, with the black piece possibly indicating the opponent's units or a different type of game piece. The red and white coloration on the chickens could be indicative of their rank, health, or some other game-related attribute."
