The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same value to create tiles with higher values. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with double the value. The game ends when there are no more moves left, and the player's score is the value of the highest tile they have achieved.\n\nTo implement a similar game, we will need to create a grid to hold the tiles, a method to generate new tiles, a method to merge tiles, and a method to check if there are any moves left.\n\nHere is a basic implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Tile:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.value == other.value\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.value)\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.grid = [[Tile(0) for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n        self.score = 0\n        self.best_score = 0\n\n    def move_right(self):\n        pass  # Implement moving tiles to the right\n\n    def move_down(self):\n        pass  # Implement moving tiles down\n\n    def merge(self):\n        pass  # Implement merging tiles\n\n    def generate_new_tile(self):\n        pass  # Implement generating a new tile\n\n    def game_over(self):\n        pass  # Implement checking if the game is over\n\n    def play_game(self):\n        pass  # Implement the game loop\n\n    def update_score(self, value):\n        self.score += value\n        self.best_score = max(self.best_score, self.score)\n\n# Example usage\ngame = Game()\ngame.play_game()\n```\n\nThis code provides a skeleton for the game. You will need to fill in the methods to move tiles, merge tiles, generate new tiles, check if the game is over, and implement the game loop.\n\nThe gameplay can be implemented using the following algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the game grid with all tiles set to 0.\n2. Generate a new tile with a random value between 1 and 2^n (where n is the highest tile value on the grid).\n3. Place the new tile on an empty space on the grid.\n4. If the new tile's value is less than the highest value on the grid, repeat step 2.\n5. If the new tile's value is equal to the highest value on the grid, merge it with the highest value tile if possible.\n6. If no more moves are possible, the game is over.\n7. Update the player's score with the value of the highest tile.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 until the game is over.\n\nOnce you have implemented the game, you can create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as Pygame to display the game and allow the user to interact with it."
