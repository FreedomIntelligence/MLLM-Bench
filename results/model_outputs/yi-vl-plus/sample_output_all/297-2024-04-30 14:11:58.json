The structure of the sofa, with its separate seat and backrest cushions, suggests that it is designed for flexibility and comfort rather than being a convertible piece of furniture. Typically, sofas that can be converted into beds often have a built-in mechanism that allows the backrest to be laid flat. This is not visible in the image.\n\nIn addition, the presence of multiple separate cushions could make it difficult to convert the sofa into a bed without the assistance of a built-in mechanism. The lack of visible buttons, levers, or other indicators of a convertible design, along with the overall aesthetic of the sofa which is more in line with a traditional, non-convertible sofa, suggests that it is not possible to convert this sofa into a bed.\n\nBased on these observations, the answer is \"No\", it is not possible that this sofa can be converted into a bed."
