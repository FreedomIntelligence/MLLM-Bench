The damage to the front end could have been caused by a high-speed impact or collision with a large object, while the damage to the rear end may have been caused by another vehicle hitting it from behind. The fact that both ends of the vehicle are damaged suggests that the car may have been involved in multiple collisions or was hit simultaneously from both ends."
