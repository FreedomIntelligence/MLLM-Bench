The reference to \"Hamas vows to kill Jews 'again and again'\" further suggests that the newspaper is reporting on statements or actions taken by Hamas that are perceived as threats to the Jewish population. The article seems to be discussing the response of some individuals to these threats and the actions taken by them, which the newspaper editorializes as being in \"not a shred of decency.\" This implies a critical view of the actions of the anti-Israel activists and a condemnation of the broader hate speech and actions directed at Israel and its supporters."
