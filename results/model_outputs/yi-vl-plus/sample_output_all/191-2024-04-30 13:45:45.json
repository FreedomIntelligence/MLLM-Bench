Lym% (Percentage of Lymphocytes): 2.7 (Normal range: 0.8 - 0.47)\n3. Mid% (Percentage of Neutrophils): 1.5 (Normal range: 0.4 - 0.5)\n4. MPV (Mean Platelet Volume): 8.6 fL (Normal range: 6.5 - 11.8 fL)\n5. RBC (Red Blood Cells): 4.33 x 10^6/L (Normal range: 4.00 - 5.50 x 10^6/L)\n6. HGB (Hemoglobin): 39 g/L (Normal range: 120 - 160 g/L)\n7. HCT (Hematocrit): 15.7% (Normal range: 38 - 48%)\n8. EOS% (Percentage of Eosinophils): 2.2% (Normal range: 0 - 3%)\n9. ALB (Albumin): 26.2 g/L (Normal range: 35 - 52 g/L)\n10. TG (Triglycerides): 48.0 mmol/L (Normal range: 0.35 - 1.50 mmol/L)\n11. UREA (Urea): 0.34 mmol/L (Normal range: 2.5 - 6.3 mmol/L)\n12.

BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen): 12.90 mmol/L (Normal range: 4.00 - 12.90 mmol/L)\n\nThe elevated WBC count suggests an infection or inflammation. The low lymphocyte percentage and high neutrophil percentage could indicate an infection or immune response. The low albumin level may suggest liver dysfunction or malnutrition. High triglycerides could be a sign of high cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The high urea and creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. The high BUN level also suggests kidney issues.\n\nBased on these abnormal values, a possible diagnosis could be an infection with complications such as liver or kidney dysfunction. However, it's important to note that a full clinical evaluation and correlation with symptoms and other diagnostic tests are necessary to determine the exact diagnosis."
