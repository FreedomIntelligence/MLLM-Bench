It is depicted in a classic style, which pays homage to the long-standing tradition of football within the club's heritage.\n\nThe text \"MANCHESTER UNITED\" is written in a bold, capitalized font, which emphasizes the club's name and reinforces its identity. The use of the word \"UNITED\" in a larger font size underscores the unity and solidarity among the club's supporters and players.\n\nIn summary, the logo's use of red color, a rampant lion, a classic football, and prominent text all work together to represent the club's identity and heritage, reflecting its values, history, and connection to the sport of football."
