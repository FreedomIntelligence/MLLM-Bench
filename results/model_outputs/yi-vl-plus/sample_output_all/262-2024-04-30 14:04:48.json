This weather phenomenon is often caused by strong winds stirring up dust and sand from the desert, creating a haze that can reduce visibility and pose health risks. The dust storm can be attributed to several factors, including climate conditions, desertification, and human activities that disturb the soil. In this context, the people are likely trying to protect themselves from inhaling dust particles that can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. The presence of the horse and cart suggests that this might be a rural or semi-urban area where traditional means of transportation are still used, and where people might be more exposed to the elements, including dust storms."
