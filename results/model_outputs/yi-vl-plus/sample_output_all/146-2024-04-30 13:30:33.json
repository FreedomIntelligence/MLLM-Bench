In the left panel, labeled \"BEFORE COFFEE,\" the cat's eyes are half-closed, and its expression is one of fatigue and disinterest. This represents a common state of being before one has had their morning coffee, where energy levels are low, and the day has just begun.\n\nIn contrast, the right panel, labeled \"AFTER COFFEE,\" shows the same cat with wide, bright eyes, an open mouth displaying its tongue, and an overall expression of extreme happiness and energy. This dramatic change in the cat's demeanor is an overstatement of the typical human experience of feeling rejuvenated and energized after consuming coffee.\n\nThe hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor by taking a relatable human situation—the boost in energy and mood from drinking coffee—and applying it to an animal, creating an amusing and exaggerated comparison. It plays on the idea that coffee has such a powerful effect that it can transform one's mood from sleepy to ecstatic, and by depicting this change in a cat, it adds a layer of absurdity and lightheartedness to the meme."
