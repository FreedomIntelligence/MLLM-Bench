The bedrooms are located at opposite ends of the floor plan, which further contributes to the privacy of the occupants by minimizing noise and movement disturbances between the two sleeping areas.\n\nThe communal areas, which include the living room, dining area, kitchen, and storeroom, are situated in the center of the plan, making them easily accessible from both bedrooms. The living room is directly accessible from both bedrooms without having to pass through any private areas, which facilitates social interaction and makes the space feel more open.\n\nThe dining area is conveniently located adjacent to the kitchen, which is a practical arrangement for serving meals. The storeroom is also centrally located, close to the kitchen and living area, making it easy to access household items.\n\nThe design includes a prayer room, which is positioned adjacent to the kitchen and dining area, making it easily accessible for the occupants. The inclusion of a prayer room within the communal areas is a thoughtful design choice that allows for convenient access without disturbing the privacy of the bedroom occupants.\n\nOverall, the floor plan's design effectively balances privacy for the bedrooms with accessibility to the communal areas, making it a functional and thoughtful layout for a residential space."
