To find the equation of the circle, we need to find the center of the circle and its radius.\n\nThe general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is:\n\n(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²\n\nWe can use the two points given to find the center and the radius.\n\nFirst, find the midpoint of the two points:\n\nMidpoint (M) = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2) = ((1 + 3)/2, (-2 + 2)/2) = (2, 0)\n\nNow, we will use the distance formula to find the radius. The distance between the midpoint and either point is equal to the radius:\n\nr = √[(x - h)² + (y - k)²]\n\nUsing the midpoint (h = 2, k = 0) and either point (1, -2) or (3, 2):\n\nr = √[(x - 2)² + (y - 0)²] = √[(1 - 2)² + (-2 - 0)²] = √[(-1)² + (-2)²] = √(1 + 4) = √5\n\nSo, the radius r = √5.\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the circle:\n\n(x - 2)² + (y - 0)² = (√5)²\n(x - 2)² + y² = 5\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle with center (2, 0) and radius √5 is:\n\n(x - 2)² + y² = 5"
