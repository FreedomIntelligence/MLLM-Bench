Cotton, as a natural fiber, is known for its excellent absorbency due to its porous structure which allows it to draw water quickly into the fabric. On the other hand, bamboo, while also a natural fiber and known for its softness and quick-drying properties, typically has a slightly lower absorbency compared to cotton. This is because bamboo towels, often made from bamboo viscose, do not have the same density of natural fibers as cotton towels which contribute to their absorbency. Therefore, based on the general properties of cotton and bamboo towels, cotton towels would exhibit greater water absorbency when new. This is consistent with the Answer provided."
