It is important to maintain cleanliness to prevent infection. Frequent hand washing with soap and water is recommended, particularly before and after meals, and after using the restroom. If the wound is recent, it may be beneficial to apply an antibiotic ointment to the area to reduce the risk of infection. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid touching or picking at the wound to prevent further irritation or delay in healing. If the wound does not improve or becomes more painful, red, or swollen, it is recommended to seek medical advice."
