The years labeled on the image range from 1957 to 2025, and the illustrations are arranged in chronological order.\n\nTo determine whether the trend shown in the image is reasonable, we need to consider the biological principles of growth and genetics. Chickens and dogs are both living organisms, and their physical characteristics depend on genetic factors and environmental factors. In the absence of selective breeding or external intervention, it is unlikely that the average size of a species will change significantly over a short period.\n\nIn addition, the image shows a significant change in the size of chickens and dogs over a short period, which is not consistent with the basic principles of biology. The trend shown in the image does not conform to the known biological growth patterns and genetic inheritance laws.\n\nTherefore, based on the known biological principles, the trend prediction shown in the image is unreasonable."
