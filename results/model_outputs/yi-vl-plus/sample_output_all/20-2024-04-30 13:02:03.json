A smash is executed by hitting the shuttlecock downward from a high point, aiming to win the rally by making it difficult for the opponent to return the shot. The player's body posture, with the arm fully extended and the position of the shuttlecock, aligns with the typical execution of a smash stroke in badminton. Therefore, the stroke being performed by the player is a smash."
