However, the necessary data for capital expenditure is not provided in the image. The table provides information on various components of cash flows but does not include specific figures for capital expenditure.\n\nLinear regression requires a set of data points that include the independent variable (in this case, the year) and the dependent variable (capital expenditure). Without the capital expenditure data, it is not possible to perform a linear regression analysis.\n\nIf the capital expenditure data were available, the general form of the linear regression equation would be:\n\nCapital Expenditure = Slope * Year + Intercept\n\nThe slope would be calculated using the formula:\n\nSlope = Σ[(Yeari - Yearj) * (Capital Expenditurei - Capital Expenditurej)] / Σ[(Yeari - Yearj)]\n\nWhere Yeari and Yearj are the years, and Capital Expenditurei and Capital Expenditurej are the corresponding capital expenditures for those years.\n\nThe intercept would be calculated using the formula:\n\nIntercept = Capital Expenditure - Slope * Year\n\nGiven the lack of capital expenditure data, it is not possible to provide a prediction for 2023. If the necessary data were provided, we could then perform the linear regression analysis to make the prediction."
