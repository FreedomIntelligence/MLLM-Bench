It involves a torero (bullfighter) performing various maneuvers in the presence of one or more bulls. The torero traditionally wears the costume seen in the image, which includes the tight-fitting suit with decorative patterns and the bright, flowing cloak called a 'muleta'. The event is culturally significant as it represents a fusion of sport, art, and cultural heritage. It has been practiced for centuries and is deeply embedded in the cultural identity of the regions where it is held. However, it is also a subject of controversy and ethical debate concerning animal rights and welfare."
