Oil paint is known for its vibrant colors and ability to create depth and texture, which is evident in the detailed and layered brushwork seen in the paintings. The glossy finish of some areas also hints at the use of oil paints, as they tend to have a natural luster. The way the paint is layered and the thickness of the application can be more characteristic of oil paints than acrylic or watercolor, which generally do not have the same level of texture and layering capability. Additionally, the rich color saturation and the way the paint has been manipulated to create different textures and effects further support the likelihood of oil paint being used as the medium for these paintings."
