The headlines on the front page use emotive language to grab the reader's attention and convey a sense of urgency or moral imperative. The main headline reads \"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\" in large, bold letters, which suggests a call to action or a rallying cry. This language is designed to evoke a sense of unity and shared purpose among the readers, possibly in defense of the subject mentioned, Suella Braverman.\n\nThe subheading \"Tory Right's warning to Rishi amid fears he's thinking of sacking Home Secretary\" provides additional context, indicating a political story involving potential job loss for a government official. The use of words like \"warning\" and \"fears\" can create a sense of anxiety or concern among the readers about the political situation being described.\n\nThe phrase \"heart-rending story on our award-winning podcast\" in relation to another story on the page, \"THE TRIAL: ASHLING MURPHY,\" is designed to evoke sympathy and interest in the podcast content. The word \"heart-rending\" suggests that the story is emotionally powerful and will move the listeners.\n\nThe overall impact of this emotive language is to engage the reader's emotions, encourage them to read further into the stories, and potentially influence their opinion on the political events being reported. The language used is persuasive and aims to elicit a response from the reader, whether it be concern, sympathy, or solidarity with the individuals involved in the stories."
