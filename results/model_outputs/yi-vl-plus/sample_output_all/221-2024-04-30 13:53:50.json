The shark receives cleaning service from these fish, which is why the latter are not attacked.\n4. Categorize the relationship as symbiosis.",

The relationship between the shark and the smaller fish can be categorized as commensalism, which means that the smaller fish benefit from the interaction without harming the shark. In this case, the smaller fish are likely following the shark to feed on parasites or dead tissue, which provides them with a food source. This type of interaction is common in the ocean and helps maintain the health of both the predator and the smaller fish. The shark does not seem to be threatened or harmed by the presence of the smaller fish, and they are able to swim close to the shark without being attacked. This type of relationship is important for the ecosystem as it helps keep the larger fish clean and healthy, which can have a positive impact on the food chain."
