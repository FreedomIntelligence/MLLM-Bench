The presence of the sewing machine, along with various fabrics and what appears to be a pile of garments or upholstery pieces in the background, suggests that the individual is engaged in a trade that involves sewing and fabric manipulation. The artisanal nature of the work is supported by the traditional appearance of the sewing machine, which is not typically found in mass production settings but rather in small-scale, custom, or repair work. This setup is consistent with the practices of a tailor or an upholsterer, who would be involved in creating, repairing, or altering clothing or furniture upholstery. Therefore, based on the machinery and materials observed, it can be deduced that the individual's profession is likely in the field of tailoring or upholstery, which are both artisanal and trade professions."
