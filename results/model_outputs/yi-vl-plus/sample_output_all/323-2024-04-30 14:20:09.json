The first image in each row has the least pixelation, and the last image has the most. This indicates that the image resolution is being reduced or the image is being enlarged beyond its original resolution, which causes pixelation. This can be a result of image compression, resizing, or a low-quality reproduction of the original image. Therefore, the answer is that the images have been progressively pixelated from left to right in each row."
