The individual on the left appears to be kneeling and holding a smaller tool, possibly a chisel or a detail hammer, indicating fine work such as sculpting or carving. The central figure is standing and wielding a larger tool, which resembles a hammer, suggesting involvement in activities that require driving nails or shaping materials, typical of carpentry or construction work. The person on the right is seated and holding a tool that resembles a saw, which is commonly used in woodworking or carpentry for cutting materials. These postures and tools are characteristic of carpenters or construction workers, who are involved in the creation, repair, or alteration of wooden structures. Therefore, the profession suggested by the postures and tools in the image is carpentry or construction."
