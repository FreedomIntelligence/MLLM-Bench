In many Eastern philosophies, such as Buddhism, a figure with a serene expression is often associated with enlightenment and the attainment of a state of Nirvana, which is liberation from the cycle of suffering. The symbolism of the statue's expression could be interpreted as an embodiment of the ultimate goal of spiritual practice, which is to achieve a state of profound peace and wisdom. The gentle smile and the closed eyes may also symbolize the compassion and benevolence of the enlightened being, representing an openness to all beings and a readiness to share wisdom and joy. The overall impression given by the statue's expression is one of harmony and balance, suggesting a figure who has transcended worldly concerns and attained a higher level of consciousness."
