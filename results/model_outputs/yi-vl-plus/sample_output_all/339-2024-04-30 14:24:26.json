Turn off the computer and disconnect it from power.\n2. Open the computer's case and carefully remove the damaged screen.\n3. Replace the screen with a new one, ensuring that it is compatible with the computer's specifications.\n4. Reassemble the computer and test the new screen to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to repair a screen with such extensive damage on your own could result in further damage or injury.
