The teacher's hands are placed over the student's, indicating a need for adjustment in the finger placement on the fingerboard and the bowing technique to ensure proper sound production and intonation. The teacher's posture suggests a moment of instruction rather than performance, with a focus on form and technique.\n\nAs for the next notes or scales they will transition to, it is not possible to determine the exact pieces from the image alone. However, given the context of a violin lesson, they might transition to a scale or a simple melodic exercise that emphasizes the corrected technique. The teacher might choose a piece that requires the student to apply the corrected form to improve their playing."
