This technique requires the dancer to leap into the air, extend one leg back and the other out to the side, then land on one leg with the other leg extended, creating a split.\n\nTo execute this landing, the dancer will need to bend her knees to absorb the impact. Her arms should be extended to the sides for balance. After landing, she might follow up with a smooth transition into another movement, such as a turn or a continuation of her dance routine."
