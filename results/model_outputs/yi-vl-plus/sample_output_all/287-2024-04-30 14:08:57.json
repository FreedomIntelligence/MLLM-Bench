Their attire, consisting of formal graduation gowns and caps, typically signifies a recent completion of a significant educational milestone, such as a bachelor's degree. The presence of young adults is further suggested by the visible youthful features and the energetic, jubilant expressions and gestures. The characters are engaging in celebratory actions like throwing their caps in the air and cheering, which are common traditions associated with graduation ceremonies, a significant event typically celebrated by young adults. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the age group of the characters in the image falls within the late teens to early thirties."
