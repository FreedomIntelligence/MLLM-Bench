The side length of the square is the same as the radius of the circle. The square has been divided into four smaller squares, each with a side length of 2 units.\n\nSince each smaller square has a side length of 2 units, we can calculate the side length of the larger square (which is equal to the radius of the circle) by adding up the side lengths of the smaller squares:\n\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 units\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle is 8 units.\n\nNow we can plug the radius into the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nA = \u03c0r\u00b2\nA = \u03c0(8)\u00b2\nA = \u03c0(64)\nA = 201.0656 square units (approximately)\n\nSo, the area of the circle is approximately 201.0656 square units."
