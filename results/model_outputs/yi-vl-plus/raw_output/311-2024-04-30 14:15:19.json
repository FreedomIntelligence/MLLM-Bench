                "content": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the relationships between the shapes and their corresponding numerical values. \n\nFrom the first equation, we see that an empty circle plus an empty triangle equals 8. \nFrom the second equation, we see that an empty circle minus an empty triangle equals 4. \nFrom the third equation, we see that a filled star plus an empty square equals 12. \nFrom the fourth equation, we see that a filled star minus an empty square equals an empty square. \nFrom the fifth equation, we see that two empty squares plus an empty square equals a filled star. \n\nNow, let's solve for the unknowns:\n\n1. Since an empty circle plus an empty triangle equals 8, and an empty circle minus an empty triangle equals 4, we can infer that an empty triangle equals 4. \n2. If a filled star plus an empty square equals 12, and a filled star minus an empty square equals an empty square, we can infer that a filled star equals 8 (since 8 - 4 = 4). \n3. If two empty squares plus an empty square equals a filled star, and a filled star equals 8, then 3 empty squares equal 8. So, an empty square equals 8/3. \n\nNow we can solve for the unknowns:\n\n1. The empty triangle equals 4.\n2. The filled star equals 8.\n3. The empty square equals 8/3.\n\nUsing these values, we can solve for the unknowns in the right-hand side equations:\n\n1. The filled star equals 8.\n2. The empty square equals 8/3.\n3. The empty triangle equals 4.\n4. The filled star minus an empty square equals 8 - (8/3) = 4/3.\n5. Two empty squares plus an empty square equals 8/3 + 8/3 + 8/3 = 24/3 = 8. \n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n1. The filled star equals 8.\n2. The empty square equals 8/3.\n3. The empty triangle equals 4.\n4. The empty square equals 8/3.\n5. The filled star minus an empty square equals 4/3.\n6. The filled star plus an empty square equals 8."
