This suggests that there might not be a direct correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita, as the US has a higher GDP per capita with lower night light intensity. However, it is important to note that this is an analysis of only three countries and a more comprehensive study would be needed to establish a clear correlation, if any, between night light intensity and GDP per capita for a larger sample of countries."
