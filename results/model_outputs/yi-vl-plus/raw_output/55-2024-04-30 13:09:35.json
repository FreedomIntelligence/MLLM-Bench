The statue is a symbol of freedom and democracy and has been a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving in the United States from overseas. It was a gift from the people of France to the United States, dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue represents the Roman goddess Libertas and is holding a torch, a symbol of enlightenment, and an olive branch, symbolizing peace. It is an enduring symbol of the friendship between the two nations and a representation of the United States' ideals of liberty and democracy."
