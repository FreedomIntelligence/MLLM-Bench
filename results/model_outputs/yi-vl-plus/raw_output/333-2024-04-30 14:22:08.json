The extent of the damage suggests that the phone is not in a usable condition without repair. The split casing could result in a loss of structural integrity, and the exposed internal components are at risk of further damage from dust, water, or physical shocks. Additionally, the damage may have affected the phone's internal circuitry, which is crucial for the device's operation. Therefore, based on the visible damage, it is reasonable to conclude that the phone is not usable without repair."
