These features are distinct and do not match the descriptions of other vegetables such as string peas, which are typically rounder and more rounded, or sugar snap peas, which have a more rounded and plump appearance. Additionally, the color and texture visible in the image align with common representations of green beans. Therefore, based on the visual characteristics observed, the green bean-like vegetable in the bowl can be identified as green beans."
