The tiger is depicted with its characteristic bold black stripes on a yellow-orange coat, which is a unique feature among the cats shown. The leopard is illustrated with a spotted coat, which is typical for its species, and it is shown in a crouching position, suggesting its agility and prowess as a predator. The lion, known for its mane, is illustrated with a full, flowing mane around its face and neck, which is a distinguishing feature of male lions. Lastly, the jaguar is depicted with a pattern of rosettes on its coat, which is a feature shared with leopards but is more robust and muscular in build. Each of these features aids in the identification of the respective species and reflects their adaptations to their environments."
