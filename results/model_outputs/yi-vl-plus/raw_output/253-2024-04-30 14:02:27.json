The roof of the gingerbread house has a different pattern of icing in each image.\n5. The candy cane on the side of the gingerbread house is in a different position in each image.\n6. The candy decoration on the gingerbread house has a different shape in each image.\n7. The background snowflake pattern has a difference in each image.\n\nThese differences are subtle and require close inspection to identify."
