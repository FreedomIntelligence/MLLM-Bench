The formula to calculate the equivalent resistance (R_eq) for resistors in parallel is:\n\n1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn\n\nIn the image, we have three resistors with the following resistances: R1 = 200\u03a9, R2 = 300\u03a9, and R3 = 400\u03a9.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\n1/R_eq = 1/200 + 1/300 + 1/400\n1/R_eq = (300 + 200 + 150) / (200*300*400)\n1/R_eq = 650 / 240000\nR_eq = 240000 / 650\nR_eq \u2248 369.23\u03a9\n\nThe current (I) flowing through the circuit can be found using Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V / R\n\nGiven that the voltage across the resistors is 5V, we can calculate the current:\n\nI = 5V / 369.23\u03a9\nI \u2248 0.01357A\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the current I is approximately 0.01A or 10mA."
