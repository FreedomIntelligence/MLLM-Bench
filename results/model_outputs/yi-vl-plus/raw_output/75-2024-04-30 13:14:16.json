The presence of a teacher and the arrangement of desks facing towards the front of the room where the teacher is standing suggest a structured learning environment. The visible content on the whiteboard includes mathematical notations, specifically the expression \"3A\" and a table with dates and some form of calculation or record-keeping. This indicates that the educational activity is likely a mathematics class, focusing on either arithmetic operations or some form of data analysis involving dates and numerical values. Thus, the type of educational activity is mathematics, and the subject could be related to arithmetic, algebra, or data analysis."
