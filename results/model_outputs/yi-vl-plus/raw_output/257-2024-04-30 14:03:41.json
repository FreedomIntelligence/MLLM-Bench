Here are the visual cues that suggest the nutritional differences between each hamburger:\n\n1. Top-left hamburger:\n   - Served with a side of fries, which are typically high in calories, fats, and carbohydrates.\n   - The burger appears to have a beef patty, which is a source of protein and saturated fats.\n   - Cheese is present, adding to the fat and calorie content.\n\n2. Top-right hamburger:\n   - This burger is served with a side of coleslaw, which is lower in calories and fat compared to fries.\n   - The burger patty looks similar to the first, suggesting similar protein and fat content.\n   - The presence of lettuce and possibly other vegetables could contribute to a slightly healthier profile due to the added vitamins and fiber.\n\n3. Bottom-left hamburger:\n   - This burger is served with a side of sweet potato fries, which may contain more calories and sugar than regular fries due to the sweet potato.\n   - The burger itself seems to have a chicken patty, which is generally lower in saturated fats compared to beef.\n   - The addition of avocado slices increases the healthy fats and calories but also provides fiber and nutrients.\n\n4. Bottom-right hamburger:\n   - This burger is served with a side of lettuce, which is low in calories and high in fiber and vitamins.\n   - The patty appears to be a beef burger, similar to the first one, indicating similar protein and fat content.\n   - There is cheese, similar to the first burger, adding fat and calories.\n\nOverall, the visual cues suggest that the burgers vary in their nutritional content mainly due to the type of patty (beef vs. chicken), the side dishes (fries vs. coleslaw vs. sweet potato fries vs. lettuce), and additional toppings (avocado). The first and bottom-right burgers have beef patties and cheese, which might be higher in calories and fats. The second burger has a similar beef patty but a healthier side dish, and the third burger has a chicken patty and avocado, which could make it a slightly healthier option due to the lower saturated fat content and the addition of healthy fats from avocado."
