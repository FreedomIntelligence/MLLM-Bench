While the appearance of the man might suggest a tough or intimidating demeanor, it does not necessarily indicate that he is vicious. Viciousness is a character trait that refers to a person being cruel, violent, or aggressive. The image alone does not provide enough information about the man's personality or actions to determine if he is vicious. Therefore, without additional context or information about the man's behavior, it is not possible to accurately conclude that he must be extremely vicious. The answer to the question is No."
