Inside the circle, there is a black pictogram of a hand with the index finger extended, which is commonly understood to represent the act of spitting. The diagonal red line across the pictogram indicates that the action it represents is not allowed. Therefore, the meaning of this sign is to inform individuals that spitting is prohibited in this area."
