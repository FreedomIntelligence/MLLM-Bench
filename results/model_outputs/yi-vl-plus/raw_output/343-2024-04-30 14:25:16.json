However, in many regions, service dogs are allowed into public places as they are considered necessary for the support and assistance of individuals with disabilities. Therefore, if a visually impaired person with a service dog is forbidden to enter the place, it could suggest biased treatment, as the prohibition applies to all dogs without exception, potentially affecting individuals who rely on service dogs for support. This could be seen as an infringement on the rights of individuals with disabilities, as service dogs are trained to assist their handlers in various aspects of daily life and are protected under specific legislation in many countries."
