Based on her attire and the context, it is reasonable to speculate that the girl could be a young child, possibly in the age range of 3 to 8 years old. Typically, children of this age group are often involved in weddings as flower girls or ring bearers, and the formal dress, along with her presence at what appears to be a wedding ceremony, supports this speculation."
