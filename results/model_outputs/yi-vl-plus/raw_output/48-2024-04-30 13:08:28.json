Tempura is a dish of battered seafood, often consisting of fish, shrimp, squid, or vegetables, which originated in Japan. Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy consisting of very fresh raw fish or meat sliced into thin pieces and often eaten with soy sauce. The presence of these specific items suggests that the dish is most likely from Japan. Therefore, the answer is Japan."
