The X-axis will represent the years from 1995-2000 to 2020-2025, and the Y-axis will represent the percentage share of taxes.\n\nEach state will have its own line on the chart, with a unique color and marker to differentiate it from others. The chart will also include a legend that lists the states and their corresponding colors.\n\nTo make the chart more interactive, we can add a hover feature that displays the exact percentage share of a state for a particular year when the user hovers over the state's line or marker. Additionally, we can include a tooltip that provides more information about a state's share in a particular year, such as the percentage share and the finance commission it corresponds to.\n\nLastly, we can add a title to the chart that summarizes the data being presented, such as \"Percentage Share of Union Taxes and Duties Allocated to States Over the Last Six Finance Commissions\". This will give viewers a clear understanding of what the chart represents."
