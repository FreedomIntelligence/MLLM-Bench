The impact on structural health is evidenced by the collapse of roofs, the destruction of walls, and the scattering of debris across the area. This suggests that the buildings were not able to withstand the force of the wind or any other elements like rain or flooding that accompany such storms.\n\nThe environmental health has also been severely impacted. The presence of debris, including building materials, furniture, and possibly hazardous materials, indicates that the natural landscape has been contaminated and poses a potential risk to local wildlife and human health. The trees in the background appear to be intact, which may suggest that the damage was predominantly due to wind rather than flooding. However, the overall destruction and the lack of any visible standing structures suggest that the impact was extreme, with the potential for long-term effects on the local ecosystem and community.\n\nIn conclusion, the disaster type is most likely a hurricane or severe storm, with significant impacts on both structural and environmental health, including damage to buildings, contamination of the natural landscape, and potential risks to local wildlife and human populations."
