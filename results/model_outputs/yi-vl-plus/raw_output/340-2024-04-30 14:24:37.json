The person in the center is lying on the ground, seemingly being held down by the officers. The image alone does not provide enough context to determine the reason behind the restraint, nor does it indicate any form of discrimination based on race, gender, or any other characteristic. The officers are wearing uniforms and are in a position that suggests they are performing their duties. Without additional context or information about the circumstances leading up to this moment, it is not possible to accurately determine if there is any discrimination occurring in this image. Therefore, based solely on the image, the answer is No."
