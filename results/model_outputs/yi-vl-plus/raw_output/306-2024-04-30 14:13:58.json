Hard, brittle materials like tempered glass are more likely to shatter upon impact with a hard surface. Conversely, if the glass lands on a softer, more forgiving surface, it may not break.\n\nIn the provided figure, the wooden floor represents a hard surface, which is typically harder and more brittle compared to the beige and white interspersed area, which can be interpreted as a carpeted or padded surface.\n\nGiven that both glasses fall from the same height and are identical, the one that lands on the wooden floor is more likely to break due to the harder surface. The glass landing on the beige and white interspersed area has a higher chance of not breaking due to the softer and more forgiving surface.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the glass that falls on the wooden floor is more likely to break."
