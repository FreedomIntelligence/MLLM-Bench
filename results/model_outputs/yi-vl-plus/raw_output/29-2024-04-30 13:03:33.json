Tug-of-war is a team sport that involves two teams of people pulling on opposite ends of a long, thick rope as they attempt to pull the other team across a central line. The objective of the game is to win by pulling the opposing team over this line. The participants' postures and the tension in the rope suggest that they are actively engaged in this competitive team activity. Therefore, the activity taking place is a game of tug-of-war."
