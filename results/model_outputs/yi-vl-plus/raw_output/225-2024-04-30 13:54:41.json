The first food chain starts with trees as the primary producers, which are then consumed by deer (herbivore), followed by the lion (predator). The second food chain begins with a flower as the primary producer, which is eaten by flies (herbivore), followed by the frog (secondary consumer), snake (tertiary consumer), and finally the eagle (apex predator).\n\nThe linear flow of energy in these food chains follows the 10% energy transfer rule, where only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is passed on to the next level. This means that as energy moves from one trophic level to the next, most of it is used for metabolic processes and lost as heat, with only a small fraction being transferred to the next level.\n\nIn the first food chain, trees convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis, which is then consumed by the deer. The deer, in turn, are preyed upon by the lion. As energy moves from trees to deer to lion, only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level, resulting in a decrease in the total energy available at each subsequent trophic level.\n\nSimilarly, in the second food chain, the flower produces energy through photosynthesis, which is consumed by flies, followed by the frog, snake, and eagle. Again, only about 10% of the energy is transferred from one level to the next, leading to a decrease in the total energy available at each higher trophic level.\n\nOverall, the linear flow of energy in these food chains demonstrates the importance of energy transfer at each trophic level and how energy decreases as it moves up through the levels."
