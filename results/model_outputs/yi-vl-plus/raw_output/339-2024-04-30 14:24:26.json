The cracks appear to be deep and widespread, affecting a large portion of the screen. \n\nTo repair the screen, it would be necessary to replace the entire display assembly. Attempting to repair the screen with a patch or adhesive would likely not be effective, as the cracks are too extensive and would compromise the integrity of the display.\n\nThe repair process would typically involve the following steps:\n\n1. Turn off the computer and disconnect it from power.\n2. Open the computer's case and carefully remove the damaged screen.\n3. Replace the screen with a new one, ensuring that it is compatible with the computer's specifications.\n4. Reassemble the computer and test the new screen to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to repair a screen with such extensive damage on your own could result in further damage or injury. It is recommended to seek the assistance of a professional technician for such repairs."
