The image on the left exhibits a noticeable amount of pixelation and blurriness, especially noticeable in the details of the person's hair and facial features. The image on the right appears to be of higher quality with finer details and less pixelation, allowing for clearer visibility of the individual's features. Based on these observations, the picture on the left is of lower quality compared to the picture on the right. Therefore, the answer is left."
