After examining the image, the dice is located in the middle of the image, slightly towards the right side. It is surrounded by cheese blocks and appears to be in the center of a cheese block arrangement. The dice is identifiable by its distinct cubic shape and the arrangement of its six faces, which are visible from the angle of the image."
