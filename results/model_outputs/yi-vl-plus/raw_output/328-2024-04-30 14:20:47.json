Include a legend or explanatory text to define what each arrow represents.\n3. Use consistent font sizes for the text labels to enhance readability.\n4. Ensure that the colors of the arrows are distinct and have good contrast against the background for visual clarity.\n5. Consider adding examples or case studies to illustrate how changes in one area (like efficiency or cost) can affect the others.\n6. If possible, use high-resolution images to ensure that the slide is clear when projected.\n7. Check for alignment and balance in the layout to make the slide aesthetically pleasing and easier to follow."
