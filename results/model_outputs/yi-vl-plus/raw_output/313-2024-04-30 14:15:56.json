Use the addition operator (+) to add the number 5 from another hexagon.\n3. Use the multiplication operator (\u00d7) to multiply the resulting number by 7 from another hexagon.\n4. Finally, use the subtraction operator (-) to subtract the number 9 from the result.\n\nThe calculation would look like this: 2 + 5 \u00d7 7 - 9 = 221\n\nThis combination results in the target number 221 using all the given hexagons and operators exactly once."
