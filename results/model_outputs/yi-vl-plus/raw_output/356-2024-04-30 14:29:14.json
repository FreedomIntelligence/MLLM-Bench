Any sudden drop in resolution or quality could indicate a possible edit.\n\n2. **Analyze the Lighting and Shadows:** Look for consistency in lighting and shadows. If there are abrupt changes or inconsistencies, it could suggest that parts of the image were added or removed.\n\n3. **Check for Discrepancies in Perspective and Proportion:** Compare the size and perspective of objects within the image. If there are any discrepancies, it could indicate an edit.\n\n4. **Look for Edges and Borders:** Pay attention to the edges and borders of objects. Sharp or abrupt edges could suggest that parts of the image were cut or pasted from another source.\n\n5. **Review the Coloration and Textures:** Examine if the colors and textures are consistent across the image. Any abrupt changes in color or texture could indicate digital manipulation.\n\n6. **Use Forensic Tools:** Utilize specialized software designed to detect image manipulation. These tools can analyze the pixels and reveal any inconsistencies or alterations.\n\nBased on the provided image, after a thorough examination, the following evidence could support the conclusion of image alteration:\n\n- The lighting and shadows on the person and the dolphin do not match, suggesting possible digital manipulation.\n- The edges of the person and the dolphin may appear sharp or abrupt, indicating that they could have been cut or pasted from another image.\n- The proportion and perspective of the person and the dolphin may not align with the surrounding water, suggesting that parts of the image were altered or added.\n- The colors and textures of the person, the dolphin, and the water may not be consistent, indicating digital manipulation.\n\nIf any of these signs of alteration are present, it would support the conclusion that the photo has been digitally manipulated."
