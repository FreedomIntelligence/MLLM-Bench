The first aspect is graphics improvement; the second screenshot has a clearer and more detailed environment than the first one. The second aspect is character design; the characters in the second screenshot have more detailed textures and better lighting effects, which makes them look more realistic. The third aspect is the environment; the second screenshot shows more details in the background and the environment is more vivid. Based on these observations, we can conclude that the next version of the game will likely focus on improving graphics, character design, and the environment."
