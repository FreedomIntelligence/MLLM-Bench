In the upper image, there is a small bird on the right side of the table, which is absent in the lower image.\n2. The character in the orange shirt is holding a coffee cup in the upper image, whereas in the lower image, the coffee cup is placed on the table.\n3. The character in the green shirt has a different pose in each image, with the laptop being held in a different manner.\n4. The character in the brown shirt is holding a phone in the upper image, but in the lower image, the phone is on the table.\n5. The character in the yellow shirt has a different hairstyle in each image.\n\nThese are the 5 differences I could identify between the two images."
