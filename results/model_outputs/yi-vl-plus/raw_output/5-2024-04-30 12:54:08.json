The main difference between this device and a general fan is that this one is multifunctional, combining the features of a fan and a speaker. While a general fan is primarily designed to circulate air and provide cooling, this device not only does that but also plays music, which can enhance the user experience, especially during outdoor activities or picnics. Additionally, the LED light feature adds an aesthetic appeal and can create a mood or atmosphere. The general fan does not have these additional functionalities."
