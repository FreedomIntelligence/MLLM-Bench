This style was developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The unique stylistic features that help identify this as a Cubist painting include the fragmentation of the subject, the use of a limited color palette with bold, vibrant colors, and the incorporation of letters and numbers as part of the composition. The flattened surface and the abstract, angular representation of the figure are also hallmarks of Cubism."
