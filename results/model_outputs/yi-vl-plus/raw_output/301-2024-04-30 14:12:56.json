                "content": "To solve the puzzle and the arithmetic, we need to determine the value of each fruit based on the equations given. \n\nFrom the first row, we have the equation C + 2 = 2, which simplifies to C = 0. This means the strawberry has a value of 0.\n\nFrom the second row, we have the equation C + 4 = 4, which simplifies to C = 0 (since we already know the strawberry has a value of 0), and therefore, the banana has a value of 4.\n\nNow, we have the equation 1 apple + 3 bananas x 2 strawberries = ?. We know the value of the strawberries (0) and the bananas (4), so we can calculate the value of the apple as follows:\n\n1 apple + (3 bananas x 2 strawberries) = 1 apple + (3 x 4) = 1 apple + 12 = ?\n\nTo find the missing piece that represents the apple, we look at the third equation given in the puzzle:\n\nC + 7 = 7, which simplifies to C = 0. This means the strawberry has a value of 0, and the apple has a value of 7.\n\nTherefore, the missing piece that represents the apple is the one with the value of 7, which is the piece in the bottom right corner of the puzzle. \n\nSo the answer to the question \"Out of the three remaining pieces, which one should you select to place in the second row and first column?\" is the piece with the value of 7."
