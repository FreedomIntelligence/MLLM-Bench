We can observe that the man in gray is holding a suitcase with a blue object attached to it. The object has a cylindrical shape and appears to be a portable device, possibly a charger or a power bank, given its size and the way it is attached to the suitcase. There is no visible label or distinct features that allow us to identify the object with certainty. Therefore, based on the visual information available, we can deduce that the blue object is likely a portable device, such as a charger or a power bank."
