                "content": "The images from left to right show a progression from a darker exposure to a lighter exposure. The left image, labeled \"\u4fee\u6539\u524d\" (before modification), appears darker with less visible detail in the shadows, indicating a higher exposure value. The right image, labeled \"\u4fee\u6539\u540e\" (after modification), is visibly brighter with more detail exposed in the shadows, indicating a lower exposure value or some form of post-processing to brighten the image. This suggests that the images have been adjusted to show different exposure settings or post-processing effects. Therefore, the answer is \"the images become lighter from left to right\"."
