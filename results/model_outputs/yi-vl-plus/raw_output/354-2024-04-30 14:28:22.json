The visual cues that lead to this conclusion include the exaggerated size of the wave compared to the buildings, the presence of a helicopter in close proximity to the wave without any visible signs of damage or disturbance, and the overall surreal and dramatic nature of the scene. In the real world, a tsunami of this magnitude would cause widespread destruction and chaos, which is not depicted in the image. Furthermore, the lighting and shadows in the image seem to be digitally altered to create a more dramatic effect. These elements combined suggest that the image is not a real photograph but rather a product of digital manipulation or AI-generated imagery designed to create a specific visual impact."
