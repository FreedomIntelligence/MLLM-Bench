These messages indicate a demand for ethical treatment of all individuals regardless of their race or ethnicity, which is a fundamental demand for equality and fairness. The ethical demand here is the cessation of discriminatory practices based on race, which is a violation of basic human rights and ethical principles. The participants in the protest are advocating for an end to racism, which aligns with the ethical demand for equal treatment and respect for all individuals. Therefore, it can be concluded that the people in the image do hold an ethical demand."
