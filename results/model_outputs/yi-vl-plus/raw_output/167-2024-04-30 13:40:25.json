The nearest emergency exit, indicated by the red square with \"EMERGENCY EXIT\" written inside, is located in the bottom-left corner of the layout.\n\nFrom the \"You Are Here\" point, the quickest route to the emergency exit involves moving eastward through the nearest aisle until reaching the exit. The path would be as follows:\n\n1. Move eastward from room 223 through the nearest aisle.\n2. Continue straight through the next room, which appears to be room 222.\n3. Turn left at the end of room 222 and proceed through room 221.\n4. Continue straight through the next room, which is room 220.\n5. Turn right at the end of room 220 and proceed through room 219.\n6.
