Starting from the left, the shapes have the following number of sides: 7 (heptagon), 6 (hexagon), 5 (pentagon), 4 (square), 3 (triangle), and 2 (circle). This suggests that the missing shape should be a 2-sided shape, which is a line or a segment.\n\nLooking at the shapes provided, we can see that the only 2-sided shape available is the green line. This matches the pattern and the requirement for the vacant space on the far right.\n\nTherefore, the correct block to select to fill the vacant space on the far right is the green line."
