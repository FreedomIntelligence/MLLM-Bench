Initially, the graph starts with a high peak, indicating a rapid increase in the number of predicted cases. However, as time progresses, the peaks become shorter and the overall number of cases starts to decline. This trend continues until the graph shows a relatively stable or slightly decreasing pattern towards the end.\n\nThe reasons for this trend of change can be attributed to various factors such as the implementation of public health measures, increased awareness among the population, the effectiveness of healthcare interventions, and the natural course of the disease's spread. For example, measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and increased testing and treatment capabilities can slow down the spread of the disease, leading to a decrease in the number of cases over time. Additionally, as the disease spreads, it may reach a point where fewer susceptible individuals are left in the population, leading to a slowdown in the rate of new cases."
