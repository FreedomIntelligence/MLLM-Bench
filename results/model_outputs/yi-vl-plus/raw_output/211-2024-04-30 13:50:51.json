The legend on the bottom of the map indicates that lighter shades of blue represent lower humidity levels (38-52%), and darker shades represent higher humidity levels (75-82%). The darkest shade of blue corresponds to the highest humidity levels of 75-82%.\n\nUpon examining the map, it can be observed that the darkest blue is concentrated in the southern part of China, particularly around the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This indicates that these areas have the greatest humidity compared to other parts of the map. Therefore, the answer \"south\" is consistent with the visual information provided on the map."
