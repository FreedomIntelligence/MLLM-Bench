                "content": "A photorealistic image of a wooden bas-relief sculpture, intricately carved with a symmetrical and complex pattern reminiscent of a mandala. The central focus is a circular motif with a cross-like figure at its heart, surrounded by layers of petal-like figures, each detailed with precision and depth. The surrounding patterns radiate outward in a harmonious array, featuring geometric shapes, angular lines, and a variety of leaf-like forms. The wood's rich, warm tones are accentuated by the play of light and shadow, highlighting the three-dimensional textures and giving the piece a dynamic yet balanced appearance. The sculpture's craftsmanship showcases a mastery of both the artistic vision and the technical skill required to create such a detailed and textured work of art."
