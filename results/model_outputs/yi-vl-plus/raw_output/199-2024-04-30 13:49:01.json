Antigen tests are used to quickly detect if someone has a current infection. \n\nIn interpreting the meaning of the two lines on the test kit, the process is as follows:\n- The test typically requires a nasal or throat swab sample.\n- The sample is then applied to the test device, which has two labeled windows: \"C\" for control and \"T\" for test.\n- If the test is negative, only the control line (C) should appear, indicating that the test has been performed correctly and no antigens were detected.\n- If the test is positive, a second line will appear next to the \"T\" label, indicating that antigens from the virus were detected in the sample.\n\nIn this image, the presence of two lines, one at \"C\" and one at \"T,\" indicates that the test is positive for COVID-19 antigens. This means that the sample tested has antigens from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the person should seek medical advice, follow local health guidelines, and possibly get a confirmatory PCR test."
