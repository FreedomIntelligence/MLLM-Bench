The saxophone is a woodwind instrument made of brass and is played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of a clarinet. It is commonly used in a variety of music genres, including jazz, classical, blues, and pop. The techniques used while playing the saxophone involve blowing into the mouthpiece while vibrating the reed to produce sound, and the player can change the pitch by pressing different keys on the instrument. The saxophone in the image is yellow, which is one of the common colors for this instrument, alongside black and silver."
