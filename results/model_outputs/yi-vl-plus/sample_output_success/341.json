The presence of another individual in the background who is not showing signs of distress suggests a contrast in reactions to the same environment. However, without additional context, it is not possible to definitively conclude if this is an instance of discrimination. Discrimination would imply a targeted action or attitude that disadvantages a particular group of people, often based on prejudiced attitudes. In this image, there is no clear evidence of such an action or attitude directed towards the woman. Therefore, based solely on the image provided, we cannot conclusively determine the presence of a discrimination phenomenon."
