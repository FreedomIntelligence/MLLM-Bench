These ingredients are arranged in a bowl, and there appears to be a wedge of lime on the side, which is commonly used as a garnish or to add a citrus flavor to the dish. The presence of lime suggests that it may be used to accent the flavors of the meat and corn. The dish is served in a rustic bowl, indicating a simple yet flavorful presentation."
