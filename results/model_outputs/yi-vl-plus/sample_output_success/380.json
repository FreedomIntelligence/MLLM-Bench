His eyes are fixated on the ball, and his hands are reaching out, indicating that he is in the process of attempting a save. Given the proximity of the ball to his outstretched hands, it appears that the goalkeeper has a good chance of making contact with the ball.\n\nIf the goalkeeper successfully saves the ball, he will likely land on the ground, depending on the force of his jump and the direction of the ball after the save. The players in red, who are closest to the goal area, will need to react quickly to retrieve the ball and continue the offensive play, potentially taking a shot or passing to a teammate in a better position.\n\nThe player wearing the number 70 jersey, who is facing away from the goal, will need to turn around and move towards the ball to be in a position to react. The player wearing the number 5 jersey is already moving towards the goal area, possibly anticipating the goalkeeper's save and preparing to clear the ball away from the goal or intercept any passes.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the goalkeeper's positioning and motion, it seems likely that he will make contact with the ball, and the subsequent positioning of players will depend on the outcome of the save attempt and the immediate reaction of the players involved."
