The \"Val.2\" suggests it is the second volume of a series. Given the subject matter and the formal presentation of the cover, the likely readers of this book would be students and professionals in the field of chemistry, particularly those specializing in or interested in organic chemistry. The mention of \"CLASSIC REPRINTSERIES\" implies that it might also appeal to those interested in historical or classic scientific literature. Therefore, the possible readers of this book would be students of chemistry, professional chemists, and enthusiasts of classic scientific literature."
