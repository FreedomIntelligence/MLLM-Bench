In freestyle, the swimmer typically faces the side of the pool while swimming, alternating arms in a front crawl motion. The swimmer's body is positioned horizontally in the water, and the legs are not visible in the image, but given the arm positioning and head angle, it is reasonable to conclude that the swimmer is performing the freestyle stroke."
