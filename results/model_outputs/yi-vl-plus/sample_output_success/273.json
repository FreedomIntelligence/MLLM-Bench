They are all facing the presenter and the projection screen, indicating their attention is directed towards the speaker and the content being displayed. There are no visible signs of disengagement such as looking away from the presenter, using electronic devices, or engaging in side conversations. The presenter's dynamic pose and the use of hand gestures suggest an interactive and engaging presentation style, which likely contributes to maintaining the audience's attention. Additionally, the setting is conducive to learning and interaction, with the arrangement of the room and the use of technology facilitating a collaborative environment.
