The total reported volumes traded are 15,316,970, while the total off-exchange short volumes are 3,349,471. The off-exchange short volumes represent approximately 21.86% of the reported volumes traded.\n\nThe relatively high percentage of off-exchange trading volume could be influencing the buying pressure and overall liquidity of the stock in several ways:\n\n1. **Market Manipulation**: The large volume of off-exchange short selling could indicate that institutional investors or market makers are attempting to exert downward pressure on the stock price. This could lead to a decrease in buying pressure as potential buyers may be deterred by the perception of strong selling interest.\n\n2. **Reduced Liquidity**: Off-exchange trading, especially when it involves short selling, can reduce the liquidity of the stock. When a significant portion of trading occurs off-exchange, it may not be reflected in the official exchange data, leading to a potentially distorted view of the true supply and demand dynamics in the market. This can make it more difficult for buyers and sellers to transact at fair prices.\n\n3. **Price Impact**: The concentration of short selling activity off-exchange might lead to price instability, as short selling can contribute to downward price movements. This can affect the overall liquidity of the stock as investors may become more cautious or may wait for more favorable pricing before entering the market.\n\n4. **Investor Sentiment**: High levels of off-exchange short volumes might negatively impact investor sentiment, as it could be perceived as a sign of bearish sentiment among institutional investors. This could lead to a decrease in buying interest, further impacting the stock's liquidity.\n\nIn summary, the relatively high percentage of off-exchange trading volume in relation to the reported volumes traded could be contributing to reduced buying pressure and lower overall liquidity for AMC stock. This situation may be influenced by factors such as market manipulation, reduced liquidity, price impact, and investor sentiment."
