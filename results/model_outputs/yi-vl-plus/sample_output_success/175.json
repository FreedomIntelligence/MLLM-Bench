This is inferred from the placement of the \"Navel Oranges\" and \"Mango\" signs, which are aligned horizontally across the image. The \"Navel Oranges\" sign is located towards the left side, and the \"Mango\" sign is towards the right. Assuming a similar alignment for the \"Lemons\" sign, it would be positioned to the right of the \"Mango\" sign but still within the bounds of the image. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the coordinates of the \"Lemons 6 for $3\" sign would be approximately (650,400)."
