The individual in the image is wearing a yellow safety jacket, which is a standard safety gear for visibility in rescue operations. The presence of heavy machinery, like the bulldozer, suggests that debris-clearing efforts are underway. The use of such machinery can help in quickly removing large amounts of debris, which is crucial in rescue operations to locate and save any survivors. However, the image does not provide sufficient information to fully assess the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation, such as the presence of trained personnel, medical support, or the organization of the rescue operation. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately gauge the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation based solely on this image."
