The first panel shows a man and a woman in a car, the man pointing out a dog, while the woman expresses a strong dislike for dogs. In the second panel, the same characters are now in a situation where they are driving the dog, with the man insisting, \"This is the way!\" This creates a humorous contradiction between the woman's stated dislike for dogs and her participation in driving one. The humor arises from the unexpected turn of events and the woman's likely internal conflict, given her earlier statement. The meme format, along with the use of bold text for emphasis and the cartoonish style, adds to the humorous exaggeration of the situation. The inclusion of the text \"This is the way!\" and the NAFO OFAN logo suggests a playful take on a situation where someone is forced into an action they initially opposed."
