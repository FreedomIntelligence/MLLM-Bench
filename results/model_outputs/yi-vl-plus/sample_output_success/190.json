To determine the gestational age, we would measure the crown-rump length (CRL), which is the length of the fetus from the top of the head to the bottom of the buttocks. This measurement is typically done between weeks 10 and 13 of gestation.\n\nBased on the image, we can identify the fetal head and the buttocks, but without a clear indication of the exact measurement tools or scale, we cannot provide an accurate CRL measurement from this image alone.\n\nIn clinical practice, once the CRL is measured, it is compared to standard growth charts that correlate the length with the gestational age. For example, a CRL of 25 mm is typically associated with a gestational age of 10 weeks, while a CRL of 70 mm is associated with a gestational age of 13 weeks.\n\nWithout the specific measurement, we cannot provide the gestational age of the fetus in this instance. For an accurate determination, the CRL must be measured using proper ultrasound tools and then compared to the standard growth charts."
