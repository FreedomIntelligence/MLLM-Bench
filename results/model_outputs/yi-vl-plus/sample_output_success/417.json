                    "content": "The visible components of the watch mechanism include gears, jewels, and plates. The gears are the cog-like wheels that interlock with each other to transmit motion, and they can be seen in various sizes throughout the mechanism. The jewels, which are typically rubies or sapphires in color, are the small red or blue points that serve as bearings or pivot points for the gears. These are usually placed at the points of highest friction to reduce wear. The plates are the flat metal pieces that hold the gears and jewels in place and form the framework of the watch movement. They are visible as the larger, flat surfaces surrounding the gears and other components. Springs are not directly visible in this image, but they are an essential part of watch mechanisms, providing the force needed to move the gears and hands."
