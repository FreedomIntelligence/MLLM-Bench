This is distinguished from traditional means of transportation such as cars, buses, and trains by its unique rail system and the fact that it can only run on a single rail. Monorails are often used for urban public transit, providing a high-capacity, high-speed, and efficient means of transportation. They are also characterized by their ability to operate in environments where space is limited, as they require only a single rail and minimal infrastructure."
