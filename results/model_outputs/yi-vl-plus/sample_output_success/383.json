The risk of this action depends on several factors, including the height of the jump, the skater's skill level, and the condition of the ramp. If the skater is experienced and the ramp is well-maintained, the risk should be manageable. However, if the skater is inexperienced or the ramp is damaged, the risk could be higher, potentially leading to an injury."
