Scan (b) shows a similar structure, but with less clarity and more surrounding artifacts. Scan (c) presents a significant degradation in image quality, with the structure barely discernible. Scan (d) further diminishes the visibility of the structure, making it nearly impossible to identify.\n\nGiven the context that a redo is required for clearer visibility of the structure in question, scans (c) and (d) would necessitate redos due to their poor image quality and lack of clarity. However, since the question specifies \"which of the CT scan needs a redo?\" implying a singular answer, and based on the visibility of the structure, scan (d) would be the most logical choice for needing a redo as it provides the least visibility of the structure.\n\nThus, the answer is D."
