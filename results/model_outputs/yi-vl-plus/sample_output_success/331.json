This suggests that the impact force was substantial, likely from the collision with the red car. The flames are most visibly consuming the front right side of the vehicle, including the engine compartment and the front passenger side. This area of the car is severely affected by the flames, indicating that the fire originated from this point of impact and has spread to the rest of the vehicle. The extent of the fire damage suggests that the car's structure in this area is compromised and may have contributed to the ignition of the fire."
