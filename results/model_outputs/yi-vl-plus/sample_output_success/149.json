This hyperbole is humorous because it creates a stark contrast between the perceived difficulty of the task in the left image (a baby simply reaching out with a small hand) and the exaggerated effort shown in the right image (lifting a heavy object). The humor arises from the absurdity of the scenario and the unexpected twist on the common experience of interacting with a baby, which is normally seen as light-hearted and gentle. The exaggerated effort and the use of a heavy object as a metaphor for a baby's hand play on the comedic element of taking a simple action and making it seem as if it were a monumental challenge."
