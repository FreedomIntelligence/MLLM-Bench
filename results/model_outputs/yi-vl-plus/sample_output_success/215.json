All datasets show a clear upward trend in global mean temperature, indicating that the Earth's average temperature has been increasing over time. The lines on the graph represent different sources or methods of collecting temperature data, and they all show similar patterns, reinforcing the reliability of the data. The recent years on the graph show a significant increase in temperature, suggesting that the rate of global warming is accelerating in the 21st century."
