                    "content": "The animal in the image is a parrot, more specifically, a Blue-and-yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna). This species is easily recognizable by its vibrant blue and yellow plumage. The blue feathers cover the wings and the majority of the body, transitioning into a bright yellow on the underside and tail. The head of the Blue-and-yellow Macaw is predominantly yellow, with a lighter shade on the forehead and a darker one on the back of the neck. The beak is curved and grey, and the eyes are surrounded by bare white skin. The feet are grey, and the toes are well-defined, designed for grasping branches. Blue-and-yellow Macaws are large parrots, and the one in the image appears to be an adult, judging by the fullness and color intensity of its feathers. These birds are native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. They are known for their intelligence, sociability, and loud calls."
