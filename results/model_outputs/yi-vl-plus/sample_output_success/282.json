He is crouching down to be at eye level with the children, which is a common teaching technique to create a more personal and approachable interaction. The presence of educational posters on the walls and the group of attentive children suggest that this is an educational environment. The adult's role appears to be that of an instructor or teacher, as he seems to be leading a discussion or lesson. His actions, such as gesturing towards the floor and addressing the children collectively, indicate that he is explaining something to them, which is typical behavior for a teacher. Therefore, based on the context and his actions, it is reasonable to infer that the adult's occupation is a teacher."
