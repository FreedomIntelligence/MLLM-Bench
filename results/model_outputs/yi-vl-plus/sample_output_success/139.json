This method is typically used in calm waters such as lakes or bays. The primary tool used by the individual is the aforementioned fishing net, which is held aloft and billowed out to maximize its surface area in the water. The specific profession of the individual can be inferred to be that of a fisherman, specifically one who employs traditional net fishing techniques to catch fish or similar aquatic life. The calm water and the use of a seine net suggest that the individual is engaged in a form of inshore or lake fishing, which is a method of fishing that is often practiced in areas where the water is shallow, and the fish population is abundant."
