In a real-time scenario, factors such as the player's speed, the opposing team's defense, and the player's skill level would influence the outcome. Since the image does not provide enough information to assess these factors, we cannot accurately predict the outcome. Therefore, based solely on the image, the answer is \"Unclear.\""
