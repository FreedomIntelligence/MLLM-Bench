The image shows a group of children engaged in the game, where one child, who is the \"it\" or \"chaser,\" is in the center of the circle and points to another child, calling them a \"duck.\" The child being pointed at must then quickly try to escape the circle without being tagged by the \"it\" child. If the \"it\" child tags the \"duck\" before they can leave the circle, the \"duck\" becomes the new \"it.\" The game continues with the new \"it\" child calling out \"duck\" and pointing to another child in the circle. The game is a lively and interactive way for children to engage in physical activity and develop social skills through teamwork, communication, and coordination."
