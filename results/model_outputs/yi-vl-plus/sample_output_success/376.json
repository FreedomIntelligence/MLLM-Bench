The chart will also include a legend that lists the states and their corresponding colors.\n\nTo make the chart more interactive, we can add a hover feature that displays the exact percentage share of a state for a particular year when the user hovers over the state's line or marker. Additionally, we can include a tooltip that provides more information about a state's share in a particular year, such as the percentage share and the finance commission it corresponds to.\n\nLastly, we can add a title to the chart that summarizes the data being presented, such as \"Percentage Share of Union Taxes and Duties Allocated to States Over the Last Six Finance Commissions\".
