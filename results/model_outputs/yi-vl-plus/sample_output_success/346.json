By presenting a woman's ability to open a jar as a surprising or questionable feat, the ad suggests that such tasks are typically beyond a woman's capabilities. This perpetuates the stereotype that women are less competent or less capable than men in basic or practical tasks. Such stereotypes can contribute to gender bias and undermine women's confidence in their abilities. Furthermore, it can limit society's perception of what women are capable of achieving, potentially affecting their opportunities in various fields, including STEM and leadership roles. The ad's message is not only sexist but also harmful as it reinforces gender stereotypes that have been the subject of much discussion and efforts to overcome."
