The design concept seems to be inspired by natural elements, such as the pattern on the structure resembling the wings of a butterfly. This could suggest an intention to create a sense of harmony between the built environment and nature. The use of lighting to accentuate the structure's form also implies a desire to make the building a dynamic presence in its environment, possibly serving as a cultural or artistic landmark. The reflective surface and the integration with the waterfront suggest a design that values interaction with its surroundings and possibly aims to engage with the public in a unique and memorable way."
