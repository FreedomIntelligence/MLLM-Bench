The bridge is depicted in a stylized manner with a strong, simple line art that conveys the idea of strength and connection, reflecting the team's values and the geographical identity of the team. The color scheme is primarily blue and yellow, which are the team's colors. Blue is often associated with trust, loyalty, and wisdom, while yellow is linked to energy, optimism, and attention.\n\nThe circular shape of the logo is a common and traditional form that symbolizes unity, completeness, and harmony. The use of a simple yet bold color palette and clear, readable typeface makes the logo easily recognizable and memorable. The design choice to use a bridge also serves as a metaphor for the team's role in connecting the fans and the community through the sport.\n\nOverall, the elements of this logo are designed to be instantly recognizable and to convey a sense of strength, unity, and connection, which are qualities that the team would want to be associated with in the public's perception. The design choices made in this logo are consistent with the branding strategies used by many professional sports teams, aiming to create a strong and lasting impression on fans and the public."
