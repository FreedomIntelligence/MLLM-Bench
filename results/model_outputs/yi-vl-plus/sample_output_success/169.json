Then the back cover.\n4. Then open a few leaves in front.\n5. Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached.\n6. Do this two or three times in order to limber up the binding.\n\nThe instructions also warn against opening the book roughly or carelessly, as this may break the back and cause the leaves to loosen. It is also advised not to force the back if it does not readily yield, as this indicates it is too tightly or strongly lined.\n\nThe clarity and effectiveness of the instructions seem to be quite good. The steps are clearly outlined with accompanying illustrations that visually demonstrate each step. The use of cautionary advice helps to prevent potential damage to the book, and the recommendation to repeat the process two or three times should ensure that the binding is adequately loosened for easier opening. Overall, the instructions appear to be straightforward and practical for someone looking to properly open a new book."
