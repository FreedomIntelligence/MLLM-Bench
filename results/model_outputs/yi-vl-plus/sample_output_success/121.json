The posture and body language of the figures imply a sense of emotional closeness and support. The lack of facial expressions due to the obscured faces focuses the viewer's attention on the body language and the act of embracing itself, which is commonly associated with feelings of love, comfort, and empathy. The simplicity of the drawing, with its minimalistic style and monochromatic color scheme, emphasizes the emotional content over the details of the figures' appearances. Therefore, the emotion conveyed by the image can be interpreted as one of affection, comfort, and emotional support."
