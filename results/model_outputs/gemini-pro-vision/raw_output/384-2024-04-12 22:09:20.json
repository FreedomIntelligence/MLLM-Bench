The teacher will help the student to relax their hand and fingers, and to use only the necessary amount of pressure to produce a clear sound.\n2. The student's right hand is not straight. The teacher will help the student to straighten their wrist and fingers, and to use a smooth, even bow stroke.\n3. The student is not using enough vibrato. The teacher will help the student to develop a more natural and expressive vibrato.\n4. The student is not playing in tune. The teacher will help the student to develop a better sense of pitch, and to play in tune with the accompaniment.\n\nOnce the student has made these corrections, the teacher will likely transition to the next notes or scales. The next notes or scales will be chosen based on the student's level of proficiency and the teacher's goals for the student."
