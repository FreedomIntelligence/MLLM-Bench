In the early 20th century, women began to fight for their rights, and they started to wear clothes that were more comfortable and practical. This led to the decline of the corset, and the rise of the flapper dress.\n\nAnother major social change that has influenced fashion trends is the increasing diversity of the population. As more and more people from different cultures immigrated to the United States, they brought their own unique styles with them. This has led to a more eclectic and diverse fashion landscape.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainability in fashion. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of their clothing choices, and they are demanding more sustainable options. This has led to the rise of ethical fashion brands, and the increasing popularity of secondhand clothing.\n\nThe evolution of fashion trends is a reflection of the changing social and cultural landscape.
