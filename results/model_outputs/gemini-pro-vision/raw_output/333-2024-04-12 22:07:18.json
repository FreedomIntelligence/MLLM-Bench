The phone is likely not usable without repair.\n\nThe phone's functionality is likely to be impaired. The shattered glass could damage the phone's internal components, and the bent frame could make it difficult to insert or remove the SIM card or charge the phone. Additionally, the phone may be water-damaged, as the shattered glass could have allowed water to enter the phone.\n\nIf you are considering repairing the phone, you should take it to a qualified repair technician. They will be able to assess the damage and determine if the phone can be repaired."
