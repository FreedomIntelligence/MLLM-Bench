Based on the current motion of the vehicles, they will continue to drive next to each other for a few seconds. However, the car on the left will eventually need to turn left, while the car on the right will continue driving straight. To avoid collision, the car on the left should turn on its left turn signal and slow down. The car on the right should stay in its lane and continue driving at the same speed."
