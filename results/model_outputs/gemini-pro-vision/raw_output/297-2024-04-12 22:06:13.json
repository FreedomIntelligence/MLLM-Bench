The sofa is upholstered in a soft, white fabric and has a tufted back and seat cushions. The sofa is also modular, meaning that it can be separated into multiple pieces for easy moving and reconfiguration. The sofa can be converted into a bed by removing the cushions and unfolding the sofa frame. The sofa frame is made of a sturdy metal and has a built-in mattress. The sofa bed is a comfortable and convenient option for guests or for those who need extra sleeping space."
