                "content": " The meme is a parody of the popular \"Distracted Boyfriend\" meme. In the original meme, a man is driving a car and looking at a woman on the side of the road. His girlfriend is in the passenger seat and is looking at him with a disapproving expression.\n\nIn this version of the meme, the man is still looking at the woman, but the woman is now replaced by a dog. The girlfriend is still looking at the man with a disapproving expression, but she is now also saying \"I hate dogs.\" The man is saying \"This is the way!\"\n\nThe meme is humorous because it plays on the stereotype that men are only interested in dogs when they are trying to impress women. It also pokes fun at the fact that some people are so focused on their phones that they don't even notice the world around them.\n\nThe type of humor employed in the meme is parody. Parody is a form of humor that imitates another work of art, literature, or music. In this case, the meme is imitating the \"Distracted Boyfriend\" meme."
