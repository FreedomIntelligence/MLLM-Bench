You can apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the wound and cover it with a bandage. If the wound is painful, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If the wound does not improve after a few days, or if it becomes more painful, you should see a doctor."
