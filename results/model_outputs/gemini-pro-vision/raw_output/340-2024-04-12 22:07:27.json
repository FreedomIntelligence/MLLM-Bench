However, it is also possible that the man is being arrested for a crime he has committed. It is important to remember that not all police officers are racist, and that not all black people are criminals. It is also important to remember that the justice system is not always fair, and that innocent people can sometimes be arrested and convicted of crimes they did not commit."
