Cook the sushi rice according to the package directions.\n2. In a small bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved.\n3. Add the rice vinegar mixture to the cooked rice and stir gently to combine.\n4. Let the rice cool slightly.\n5. Cut the fish, cucumbers, and avocado into thin slices.\n6. Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo rolling mat.\n7. Dip your hands in the vinegar water to prevent the rice from sticking.\n8. Spread a thin layer of rice across the nori.\n9. Leave a 1-inch border of nori at the top.\n10. Add a line of fish, cucumber, and avocado to the center of the rice.\n11. Starting at the bottom, begin to roll the nori up tightly.\n12. As you roll, use your fingers to tuck in the sides of the nori.\n13. Once the roll is completely rolled up, use a sharp knife to slice it into 8 pieces.\n14.
