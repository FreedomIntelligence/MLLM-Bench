We are given the point $$(3, 2)$$ which lies on the circle, so we can use the distance formula to find the radius:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (2 - (-2))^2}$$\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2}$$\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{20}$$\n\nWe now have the center and the radius, so we can plug these values into the equation of a circle to get the equation of this circumference:\n\n$$(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 20$$"
