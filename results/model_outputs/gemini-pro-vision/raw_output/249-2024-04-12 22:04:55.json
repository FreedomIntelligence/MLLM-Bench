The Earth is larger than Mars, with a diameter of about 12,742 km compared to Mars' 6,779 km. The Earth is also more massive than Mars, with a mass of about 5.972 x 10^24 kg compared to Mars' 6.4171 x 10^23 kg.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases. The Martian atmosphere is composed of 95.3% carbon dioxide, 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and 0.13% oxygen. The Earth's atmosphere is much thicker than Mars', with a surface pressure of about 1013 hPa compared to Mars' 600 Pa. The Earth's atmosphere also contains much more water vapor than Mars'.\n\nThe Earth's surface is covered in water, land, and ice. The land is divided into continents, which are large masses of land that are separated by oceans. The Earth's surface is also covered in mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. Mars' surface is covered in rocks, sand, and ice. There are also volcanoes and canyons on Mars.\n\nThe Earth's climate is much more varied than Mars'. The Earth has a wide range of temperatures, from -89\u00b0C to 56.7\u00b0C. Mars has a much narrower range of temperatures, from -125\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. The Earth also has a much more active climate than Mars. The Earth has frequent storms, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Mars has very few storms.\n\nThe Earth is home to a wide variety of life, including plants, animals, and humans. Mars is not home to any known life. However, there is evidence that Mars may have once been home to life."
