The instructions are also accompanied by helpful illustrations that show how to perform each step.\n\nThe instructions begin by explaining that you should place the book on a table with its back on the table. You should then let the front cover down, followed by the back cover. Next, you should open a few leaves in front and then a few leaves in back, alternating front and back. You should then gently press them down until the center is reached.\n\nThe instructions then explain that you should do this two or three times in order to loosen the volume. You should not force the back, as this may break the volume or cause the leaves to loosen. The instructions conclude by explaining that you should never force the back, as this may damage the book.\n\nOverall, the instructions are clear and effective. They are easy to follow and understand, and they provide a step-by-step guide on how to properly open a new book. The instructions are also accompanied by helpful illustrations that show how to perform each step."
