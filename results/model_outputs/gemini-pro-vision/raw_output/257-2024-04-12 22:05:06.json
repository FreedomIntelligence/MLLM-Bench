The second hamburger has a fried chicken patty, lettuce, and mayonnaise. The third hamburger has a grilled chicken patty, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and cucumbers. The fourth hamburger has two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickles.\n\nThe nutritional differences between the hamburgers are suggested by the visual cues in the image. The first hamburger is likely to be the highest in calories and fat, as it has the most visible fat and the most toppings. The second hamburger is likely to be lower in calories and fat, as it has less visible fat and fewer toppings. The third hamburger is likely to be the lowest in calories and fat, as it has the least visible fat and the fewest toppings. The fourth hamburger is likely to be higher in protein, as it has two beef patties."
