                "content": " The Arecibo Observatory suffered significant damage when a cable snapped in August 2020, causing the 900-ton instrument platform to fall 450 feet onto the 1,000-foot-wide dish below.\n\nThe damage to the telescope is extensive. The platform is completely destroyed, and the dish is badly damaged. The cables that supported the platform are also damaged.\n\nTo repair the telescope, the platform will need to be replaced, and the dish will need to be repaired or replaced. The cables will also need to be replaced.\n\nThe tools necessary for repairing the telescope will include cranes, welding equipment, and other heavy machinery. The cost of repairing the telescope is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIt is unclear whether the telescope will be repaired or replaced. The decision will likely be made by the National Science Foundation, which owns the telescope."
