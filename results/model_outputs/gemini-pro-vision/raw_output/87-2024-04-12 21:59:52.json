The tread pattern is made up of a series of small, raised rubber lugs that provide grip on both wet and dry surfaces. The lugs are also designed to channel water away from the foot, which helps to keep the shoe dry and comfortable.\n\nThe tread design on this shoe is also designed to provide cushioning and shock absorption. The lugs are made of a soft, flexible rubber that absorbs impact and helps to reduce foot fatigue. The tread pattern also helps to distribute weight evenly across the foot, which can help to prevent pain and discomfort.\n\nOverall, the tread design on this shoe is designed to provide traction, stability, cushioning, and shock absorption. These features make the shoe ideal for a variety of activities, including running, walking, and hiking."
