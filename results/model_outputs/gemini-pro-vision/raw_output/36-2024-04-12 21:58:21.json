The words \"Golden State Warriors\" are written in white around the circle.\n\nThe logo is a simple design, but it is very effective. The bridge is a symbol of strength and resilience, and it represents the city of San Francisco, where the Warriors are based. The blue and yellow colors are also very striking, and they help to make the logo stand out.\n\nThe logo is very recognizable, and it is one of the most popular in the NBA. It is a symbol of the Warriors' success, and it is a reminder of the team's rich history.\n\nThe logo has been used by the Warriors since 1971, and it has only undergone minor changes over the years. The most significant change was made in 2010, when the team changed its colors from blue and yellow to blue and gold.
