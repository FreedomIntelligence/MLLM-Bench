The cables are attached to the deck of the bridge, which is where the traffic travels. Suspension bridges are often used to span long distances, such as rivers or valleys.\n\nThe bridge in the image is the Manhattan Bridge, which is located in New York City. The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff and opened in 1909. It is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the city.\n\nThe Manhattan Bridge is an example of a neo-Gothic architectural style. This style is characterized by its use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. The bridge is also made of steel, which was a new material at the time it was built."
