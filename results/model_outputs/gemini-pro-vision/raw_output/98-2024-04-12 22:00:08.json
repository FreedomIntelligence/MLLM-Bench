The painting is a large oil on canvas, measuring 260 x 207 cm and is currently housed in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, Germany.\n\nThe painting is a typical example of the Baroque style, with its dramatic lighting, exaggerated gestures, and rich colors. The composition is dynamic and full of movement, with the figures of Saint George and the dragon locked in a fierce battle. The colors are vibrant and contrasting, with the red of Saint George's cloak and the white of his horse standing out against the dark background. The painting is also full of symbolism, with the dragon representing evil and Saint George representing good. The painting is a masterpiece of the Baroque style and is one of Rubens' most famous works."
