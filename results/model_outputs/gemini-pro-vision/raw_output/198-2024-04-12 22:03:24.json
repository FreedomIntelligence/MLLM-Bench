The average body temperature is 37\u00b0C, but it can vary from person to person and throughout the day. A normal body temperature range is between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C. If your temperature is above 37.5\u00b0C, you may have a fever. A fever is a sign that your body is fighting an infection. If you have a fever, you should rest and drink plenty of fluids. You should also see a doctor if your fever is high or does not go away after a few days."
