This can be caused by several things, such as pulling on the cord, dropping the headset, or getting it caught in something.\n\nTo repair the headset, you will need the following tools:\n\n* A soldering iron\n* Solder\n* A wire stripper\n* A pair of pliers\n* A screwdriver\n\nFirst, remove the ear cups from the headset. This is usually done by unscrewing the screws that hold them in place.\n\nOnce the ear cups are removed, you will be able to see the wires that connect them to the headband. Find the wire that is broken and cut it away from the rest of the wire.\n\nNext, strip the ends of the wire that you have cut. This will expose the metal core of the wire.\n\nTin the ends of the wire with solder. This will help to make them easier to solder together.\n\nNow, connect the two ends of the wire together. Make sure that the positive and negative wires are connected correctly.\n\nSolder the two ends of the wire together. Hold the soldering iron to the wires until the solder melts and flows together.\n\nOnce the solder has cooled, use the pliers to crimp the ends of the wire together. This will help to secure the connection.\n\nNow, reattach the ear cups to the headband.\n\nYour headset should now be repaired and working properly."
