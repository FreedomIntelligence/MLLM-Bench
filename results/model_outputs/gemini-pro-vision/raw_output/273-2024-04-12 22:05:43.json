The woman in the foreground is making eye contact with the presenter and appears to be interested in what she is saying. The man in the foreground is also making eye contact with the presenter, but he is also looking at his laptop. This suggests that he is only partially engaged in the presentation. The woman in the background is not making eye contact with the presenter and is looking at her phone. This suggests that she is not engaged in the presentation. The man in the background is also not making eye contact with the presenter and is looking out the window. This suggests that he is not engaged in the presentation."
