The treemap shows the percentage of share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state in India over the last 6 finance commissions. The states are arranged in descending order by their percentage of share. The treemap clearly shows that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh are the three states that have the highest percentage of share of union taxes and duties allocated to them. The treemap also shows that the percentage of share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state has changed over time. For example, the percentage of share of union taxes and duties allocated to Uttar Pradesh has decreased over time, while the percentage of share of union taxes and duties allocated to Bihar has increased over time."
