The mass is approximately 5 cm in diameter and has a smooth, well-circumscribed border. There is surrounding edema and mass effect, with compression of the right lateral ventricle.\n- There is no evidence of hemorrhage or calcification within the mass.\n\n**Impression:**\n\n- Large, round, hypodense mass lesion in the right frontal lobe of the brain, most likely representing a brain tumor. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended to better characterize the lesion and determine its exact nature.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- MRI of the brain with contrast\n- Neurosurgical consultation"
