Pineapples are typically seen as food, and not as objects that can be accessorized. By adding human-like accessories to a pineapple, it is possible to create a sense of humor by playing with the expectations of the viewer. The viewer may be surprised or amused by the unexpectedness of the image, and this can lead to laughter. Additionally, the use of human-like accessories on a fruit can create a sense of anthropomorphism, which can also be humorous. Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human objects or animals. By giving the pineapple human-like accessories, it is possible to create a sense of humor by blurring the line between humans and animals, or in this case, fruits."
