The oxpecker benefits by feeding on the warthog's parasites, such as ticks and fleas, which helps to keep the warthog healthy. The warthog benefits by having the oxpecker remove these parasites, which can cause irritation and disease. In addition, the oxpecker may also help to alert the warthog to danger, as the birds are often the first to spot predators."
