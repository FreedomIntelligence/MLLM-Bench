The damage is likely caused by a physical impact, such as the computer being dropped or hit.\n\nThere are a few possible ways to repair the computer screen. One option is to replace the entire screen. This is the most expensive option, but it will result in the best quality repair. Another option is to repair the screen by replacing the damaged glass.
