The gestational age of the fetus can be estimated by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL). The CRL is the length from the top of the head to the bottom of the buttocks. In this image, the CRL measures 6.5 cm. According to standard growth charts, a CRL of 6.5 cm corresponds to a gestational age of 12 weeks."
