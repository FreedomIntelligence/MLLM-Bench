This will allow her to maintain balance and control while transitioning into the next movement. \n\nThe dancer may follow the landing with a \"relev\u00e9,\" rising back up onto the toes, or she may continue with a series of small, quick steps, such as \"petits allegro.\" These movements would allow her to build momentum and transition smoothly into the next phase of the dance."
