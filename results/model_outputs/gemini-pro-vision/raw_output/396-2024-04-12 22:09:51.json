The second stage is the caveman, who communicates through drawings and paintings. The third stage is the man with a bow and arrow, who communicates through written language. The fourth stage is the man with a telephone, who communicates through electronic devices.\n\nThe trend is that communication is becoming increasingly electronic. The next stage will be the man with a brain implant, who communicates through thought."
