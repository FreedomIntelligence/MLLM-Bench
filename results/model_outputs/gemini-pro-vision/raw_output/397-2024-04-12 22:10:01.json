The capital expenditure is the sum of depreciation and amortization and right-of-use assets.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the depreciation and amortization and right-of-use assets for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\nFor 2020, the depreciation and amortization is 651,523 and right-of-use assets is 148,945. So, the total is 651,523 + 148,945 = 800,468.\n\nFor 2021, the depreciation and amortization is 1,495,380 and right-of-use assets is 348,863. So, the total is 1,495,380 + 348,863 = 1,844,243.\n\nFor 2022, the depreciation and amortization is 2,224,169 and right-of-use assets is 510,915. So, the total is 2,224,169 + 510,915 = 2,735,084.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the average annual growth rate of the capital expenditure. The average annual growth rate is (2,735,084 - 800,468) / (2022 - 2020) = 617,209.\n\nFinally, we can use the average annual growth rate to predict the capital expenditure in 2023. The predicted capital expenditure in 2023 is 2,735,084 + 617,209 = 3,352,293."
