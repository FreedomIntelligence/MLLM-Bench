The master bedroom has a private bathroom, while the other two bedrooms share a bathroom. The communal areas are located in the center of the house and include the living room, dining room, and kitchen. The kitchen is located at the back of the house and has a separate entrance, which allows for easy access from the outside. The living room and dining room are located at the front of the house and have large windows that let in natural light. The prayer room is located next to the living room and has a separate entrance, which allows for privacy during prayer. The floor plan is well-designed and provides privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas."
