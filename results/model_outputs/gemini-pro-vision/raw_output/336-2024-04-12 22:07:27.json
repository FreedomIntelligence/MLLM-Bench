The incident may have made people less likely to want to use the facility, and it may take some time for the facility to regain its reputation.\n\nThe overall cost of the incident is likely to be significant, both in terms of the physical damage and the reputational damage. It is important to weigh the costs and benefits of repairing the facility before making a decision about whether or not to proceed with repairs."
