This is because night light intensity is a measure of economic activity. When there is more economic activity, there is more light being used. This is because businesses and homes are using more electricity. More electricity usage means that there is more economic activity.\n\nThe correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita is not perfect. There are some countries with high night light intensity and low GDP per capita, and vice versa. This is because there are other factors that affect GDP per capita, such as the availability of natural resources, the level of education, and the political stability of the country.\n\nOverall, the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita is a strong one. It is a good indicator of the level of economic activity in a country."
