                "content": " The area of a circle is \\(\\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the radius of the circle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle, which is 8, and the other two sides are the two radii of the circle. We can write the Pythagorean Theorem as follows:\n\n$$8^2 = r^2 + r^2$$\n\nSolving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\n$$r^2 = 32$$\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nNow that we know the radius of the circle, we can use the formula for the area of a circle to find the area:\n\n$$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\\pi$$\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is \\(32\\pi\\) square units."
