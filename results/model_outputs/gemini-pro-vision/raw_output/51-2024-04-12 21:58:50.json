The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese Empire or its predecessor states against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later being joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220\u2013206 BC), the first Emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains today. The most well-known sections of the wall were built during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644)."
