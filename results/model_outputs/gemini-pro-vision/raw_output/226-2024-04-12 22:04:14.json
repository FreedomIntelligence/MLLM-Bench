The primary consumers are the animals that eat the plants, such as rabbits, squirrels, and mice. The secondary consumers are the animals that eat the primary consumers, such as foxes, hawks, and owls. The decomposers are the organisms that break down dead plants and animals, such as fungi and bacteria.\n- If one species were to become extinct, it would have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. For example, if the rabbits were to become extinct, the foxes and hawks would have fewer to eat, and their populations would decline. This would then cause an increase in the population of mice, which would eat more plants. This could lead to a decrease in the population of plants, which would have a negative impact on the entire ecosystem.\n- Another example of a cascade effect is if the fungi were to become extinct. Fungi are decomposers, which means that they break down dead plants and animals. If the fungi were to become extinct, the dead plants and animals would not decompose, and they would build up in the environment. This would make it difficult for new plants to grow, and the entire ecosystem would suffer.\n- The food web is a complex system, and it is difficult to predict exactly what would happen if one species were to become extinct. However, it is clear that the extinction of one species would have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem."
