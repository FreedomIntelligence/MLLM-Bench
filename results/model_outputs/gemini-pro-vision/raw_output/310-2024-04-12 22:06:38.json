                "content": " We have that triangle PQR is equilateral, so all its sides measure \\(72\\text{ cm}\\). Since \\(S\\) is the midpoint of \\(QR\\), then \\(QS=SR=36\\text{ cm}\\). Also, \\(T\\) is the midpoint of \\(PQ\\), so \\(PT=TQ=36\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nNow, let \\(M\\) be a point on \\(QR\\) such that \\(QM=36\\text{ cm}\\). Then, \\(M\\) is also the midpoint of \\(QR\\) and \\(SM=36\\text{ cm}\\).\n\nWe have that \\(\\triangle QMS\\) and \\(\\triangle QUS\\) have the same base and the same height. Therefore, they have the same area. But the area of \\(\\triangle QMS\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot36\\cdot36=648\\text{ cm}^2\\). Therefore, the area of \\(\\triangle QUS\\) is also \\(648\\text{ cm}^2\\).\n\nFinally, we have that \\(\\triangle QUS\\) and \\(\\triangle PSR\\) have the same base and the same height. Therefore, they are congruent."
