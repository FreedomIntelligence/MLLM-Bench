The photograph can be associated with surrealism, a 20th-century art movement that sought to express the unconscious mind through dreamlike imagery.\n\nThe painting is characterized by its use of unexpected juxtapositions, such as the woman in a blue dress standing in a desert, and the large red rose that is growing out of the ground. The painting also has a dreamlike quality, and it is not clear what is real and what is imagined."
