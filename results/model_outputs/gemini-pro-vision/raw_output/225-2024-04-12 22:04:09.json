The deer is then consumed by the lion, which is the top predator in this food chain.\n\n- In the second food chain, the energy flows from the flowers to the flies to the frog to the snake to the eagle. The flowers produce food through photosynthesis, which is then consumed by the flies. The flies are then consumed by the frog, which is then consumed by the snake. The snake is then consumed by the eagle, which is the top predator in this food chain.\n\n- In the third food chain, the energy flows from the algae to the small fish to the larger fish to the birds. The algae produce food through photosynthesis, which is then consumed by the small fish. The small fish are then consumed by the larger fish, which are then consumed by the birds, which are the top predators in this food chain.\n\nIn all three food chains, the energy flows from the producers (the plants) to the consumers (the animals). The producers use the energy from the sun to create food, which is then passed along to the consumers. The consumers use the energy from the food to survive and reproduce."
