A smash is a powerful overhead stroke that is typically used to win a point.\n\nAfter the player in mid-air performs the smash, the opponent may attempt to return the shuttle with a defensive stroke, such as a block or a lift. If the opponent is successful in returning the shuttle, the player who performed the smash may then attempt to hit the shuttle again with an attacking stroke, such as a drive or a drop shot. The opponent may then attempt to return the shuttle again, and the rally will continue until one player is unable to return the shuttle.\n\nIt is also possible that the player in mid-air will perform a net shot. A net shot is a soft, controlled stroke that is typically used to place the shuttle near the net. If the opponent is unable to reach the shuttle, the player who performed the net shot may then win the point."
