The image is captioned \"Mondays...\"\n\nThe humor in the image is derived from the fact that the cat appears to be very tired and/or sad. This is something that many people can relate to on Mondays, as it is often a day that is associated with work and stress. The image is also humorous because it is unexpected. The viewer is likely expecting to see a picture of something related to work or stress, but instead they are presented with a picture of a cat. This unexpectedness creates a sense of surprise and amusement."
