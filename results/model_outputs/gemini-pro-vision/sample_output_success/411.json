The string players use bows to play their instruments, which include violins, violas, cellos, and double basses. The violins are the highest-pitched strings and are played by the first and second violinists. The violas are lower-pitched than the violins and are played by the violists. The cellos are lower-pitched than the violas and are played by the cellists. The double basses are the lowest-pitched strings and are played by the double bassists.\n\nThe woodwind section is located to the left of the string section. The woodwind players use reeds to play their instruments, which include flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The flutes are the highest-pitched woodwinds and are played by the flutists. The oboes are higher-pitched than the clarinets and are played by the oboists. The clarinets are the lowest-pitched woodwinds and are played by the clarinetists. The bassoons are the lowest-pitched woodwinds and are played by the bassoonists.\n\nThe brass section is located to the right of the string section. The brass players use mouthpieces to play their instruments, which include trumpets, trombones, and French horns. The trumpets are the highest-pitched brass instruments and are played by the trumpeters. The trombones are lower-pitched than the trumpets and are played by the trombonists. The French horns are lower-pitched than the trombones and are played by the French horn players.\n\nThe percussion section is located at the back of the stage. The percussion players use mallets, sticks, and brushes to play their instruments, which include drums, cymbals, and xylophones. The drums are the loudest instruments in the orchestra and are played by the drummers. The cymbals are used to add brightness to the orchestra's sound and are played by the cymbalists. The xylophones are used to add a high-pitched sound to the orchestra's sound and are played by the xylophonists.\n\nThe musicians in the orchestra are all dressed in formal attire. The men are wearing tuxedos and the women are wearing long dresses. The musicians are all sitting in a specific arrangement on the stage. The conductor is standing in front of the orchestra and is using a baton to lead the musicians. The musicians are all watching the conductor and are following his/her instructions."
