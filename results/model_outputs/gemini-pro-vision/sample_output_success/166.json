The activists claim that the posters were a form of \"propaganda\" and that they were \"not a shred of decency.\"\n\nThe article has been met with criticism from some who believe that the activists' actions were disrespectful and insensitive. Others have defended the activists' actions, arguing that they were simply expressing their political views.\n\nThe broader context of the event is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. The two sides have been engaged in a decades-long struggle for control of the land that they both claim as their own. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people on both sides.\n\nThe article highlights the deep-seated hatred that exists between some Israelis and Palestinians. It also shows how the conflict can sometimes spill over into seemingly unrelated areas, such as the posting of posters."
