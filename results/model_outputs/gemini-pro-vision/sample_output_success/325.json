This can be done by using a flash or by increasing the ISO setting on the camera. The ISO setting controls the sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light. A higher ISO setting will make the camera more sensitive to light, which will result in a brighter image. However, increasing the ISO setting can also lead to noise in the image. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between a high enough ISO setting to make the image bright and a low enough ISO setting to avoid noise.\n\nAdditionally, the quality of the image can be improved by using a tripod. A tripod will keep the camera steady, which will help to avoid blurry images."
