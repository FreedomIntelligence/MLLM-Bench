                    "content": " The speech is about the importance of college entrance exams. The speaker uses three rhetorical codes to support his argument: logos, pathos, and ethos.\n\n**Logos** is the use of logic and reason to persuade the audience. The speaker uses logos by providing statistics and evidence to support his claims. For example, he states that \"the college entrance exams are fair because they are based on a student's academic performance.\" He also cites a study that shows that students who score well on the exams are more likely to succeed in college.\n\n**Pathos** is the use of emotion to persuade the audience. The speaker uses pathos by appealing to the audience's sense of fairness and justice. He argues that the college entrance exams are necessary because they help to level the playing field for students from all backgrounds. He also tells the story of a student who was able to overcome poverty and attend college thanks to the exams.\n\n**Ethos** is the use of the speaker's credibility to persuade the audience. The speaker uses ethos by establishing himself as an expert on the college entrance exams. He has a Ph.D. in education and has worked in the field for many years. He also cites his own personal experience as a student who took the exams.\n\nThe speaker's use of logos, pathos, and ethos helps to make his argument persuasive. He provides a strong logical case for the exams, he appeals to the audience's emotions, and he establishes himself as a credible source. As a result, the audience is more likely to be persuaded by his argument."
