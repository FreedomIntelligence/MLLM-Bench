He just couldn't seem to figure it out.\n\nHe sighed and got out of bed. He walked over to his desk and picked up his pencil and paper. He started to work on the problem again, but he still couldn't figure it out.\n\nHe was about to give up when he heard a noise. He looked up and saw his dog, Sparky, sitting in the doorway. Sparky wagged his tail and came over to the desk.\n\nThe boy smiled. \"Hey, Sparky,\" he said. \"Can you help me with this math problem?\"\n\nSparky barked and jumped up on the chair next to the boy. The boy laughed and started to explain the problem to Sparky.\n\nAs the boy talked, Sparky listened intently. When the boy was finished, Sparky barked again and jumped down from the chair.\n\nThe boy was confused. \"What are you doing, Sparky?\" he asked.\n\nSparky went over to the door and barked again. The boy got up and followed him.\n\nSparky led the boy to the living room, where the boy's father was sitting in a chair. The boy's father looked up and smiled when he saw the boy.\n\n\"What's up, son?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm having trouble with this math problem,\" the boy said. \"Can you help me?\"\n\nThe boy's father laughed. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Let me see it.\"\n\nThe boy handed his father the paper, and his father started to look at it.\n\n\"This is a tough one,\" the boy's father said. \"But I think I can help you figure it out.\"\n\nThe boy's father started to explain the problem to the boy, and the boy listened intently. When the boy's father was finished, the boy smiled.\n\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" he said. \"I understand it now.\"\n\nThe boy's father smiled back. \"You're welcome,\" he said. \"Now go get some sleep.\"\n\nThe boy went back to his bedroom and got into bed. He closed his eyes and thought about the math problem. He smiled to himself. He knew that he would be able to do it now.\n\nThe boy drifted off to sleep, and Sparky curled up next to him. The boy smiled and put his arm around Sparky. He was glad that he had Sparky to help him with his math problems."
