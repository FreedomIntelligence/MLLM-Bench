    "criteria": "1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",

The average temperature in 2023 is 1.09 degrees Celsius higher than the average temperature in 1850. \n\nThe chart implies that the Earth is getting warmer. The average global temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial era. This may not seem like a lot, but it is already having a significant impact on the planet. The warming is causing sea levels to rise, glaciers to melt, and extreme weather events to become more frequent and severe."
