The platform is completely destroyed, and the dish is badly damaged. The cables that supported the platform are also damaged.\n\nTo repair the telescope, the platform will need to be replaced, and the dish will need to be repaired or replaced.

The cost of repairing the telescope is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIt is unclear whether the telescope will be repaired or replaced.
