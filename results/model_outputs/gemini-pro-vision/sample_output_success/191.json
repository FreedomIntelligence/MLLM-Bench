Iron deficiency anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough iron to make hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This can cause a number of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin. Iron deficiency anemia is most common in women, children, and people with certain medical conditions, such as bleeding disorders or cancer."
