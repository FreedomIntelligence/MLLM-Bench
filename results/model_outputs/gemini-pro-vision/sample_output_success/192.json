There is surrounding edema and mass effect, with compression of the right lateral ventricle.\n- There is no evidence of hemorrhage or calcification within the mass.\n\n**Impression:**\n\n- Large, round, hypodense mass lesion in the right frontal lobe of the brain, most likely representing a brain tumor.
