This is in contrast to the \"before coffee\" photo, where the cat has a more neutral expression. The exaggeration in the \"after coffee\" photo is humorous because it shows how much the cat's mood has changed after drinking coffee. The cat is so happy and excited that it looks like it is ready to take on the world."
