The stripes also represent the blood that was shed in the American Revolution. The 50 stars represent the 50 states. The blue canton represents the union of the states. The stars are arranged in 6 rows of 8 stars each, with one star in the top left corner. The flag was designed by Betsy Ross in 1776.\n\nThe Chinese flag has a red field with five gold stars in the upper left corner. The red field represents the blood that was shed in the Chinese Revolution. The five stars represent the five classes of people in China: workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and capitalists. The flag was designed by Zeng Liansong in 1949.\n\nThe two flags are similar in that they are both rectangular and have red backgrounds. However, they are different in that the American flag has stripes, while the Chinese flag has stars. The American flag is also larger than the Chinese flag.\n\nThe American flag is a symbol of freedom and democracy. The Chinese flag is a symbol of communism and socialism. The two flags represent two very different political systems."
