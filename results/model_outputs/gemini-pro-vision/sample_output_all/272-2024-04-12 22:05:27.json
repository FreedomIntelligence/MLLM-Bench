The man and the woman are both smiling, which suggests that they are pleased to meet each other. They are dressed professionally, which indicates that they are in a business setting. A woman, presumably the man's secretary, is sitting to the right of the man. She has a slight smile on her face and is looking at the woman the man is shaking hands with. This suggests that she is pleased with the interaction between the two individuals.\n\nThe handshake is a common gesture of greeting and farewell. It can also be used to seal a deal or to show respect. In this case, the handshake is likely a sign of respect and a way to show that they are pleased to meet each other.\n\nOverall, the image suggests that the two individuals are engaged in a positive and respectful relationship."
