Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving clouds of hot gas and ash that can reach temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. They can travel at speeds of up to 700 kilometers per hour and can devastate entire areas.\n\nThe impact of pyroclastic flows on structural and environmental health can be significant. The extreme heat and speed of the flows can cause widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The ash and dust from the flows can also pollute the air and water, making it difficult for people to breathe and drink. The long-term effects of pyroclastic flows can include respiratory problems, skin irritation, and eye damage."
