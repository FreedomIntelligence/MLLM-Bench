The use of words such as \"evil\", \"heart-rending\", and \"rending\" are all designed to evoke strong emotions in readers. The headline \"Come for Suella and you come for us all\" is particularly emotive, as it suggests that the government is under attack and that readers should come to its defense. This type of language is likely to polarize readers and make them more likely to take sides on the issues being discussed."
