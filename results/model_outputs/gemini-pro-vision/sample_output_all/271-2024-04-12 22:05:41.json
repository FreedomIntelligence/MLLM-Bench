They may have come together to witness the signing event as a way to strengthen these ties or to create new ones.\n4. **Sense of community:** The group may feel a sense of community with each other, and they may have come together to witness the signing event as a way to celebrate this sense of community. They may feel that they are part of something larger than themselves, and they may be proud to be a part of this event.\n\nThe signing event is likely to be a memorable occasion for the group, and it may be something that they talk about for years to come.
