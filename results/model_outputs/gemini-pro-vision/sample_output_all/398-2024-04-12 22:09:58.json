                    "content": " The trend of change in the predicted graph is that people are becoming more obese. This is because people are eating more unhealthy foods and getting less exercise.\n\nThe graph shows that the percentage of obese people in the United States has increased from 13.4% in 1960 to 36.2% in 2010. This is a significant increase, and it is a major public health concern.\n\nThere are a number of factors that have contributed to this increase in obesity. One factor is that people are eating more unhealthy foods. These foods are often high in calories, fat, and sugar, and they can contribute to weight gain. Another factor is that people are getting less exercise. This is due in part to the fact that people are spending more time sitting at their desks or in front of the TV.\n\nThe increase in obesity has a number of negative consequences. Obese people are more likely to develop heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. They are also more likely to die at a younger age.\n\nThe good news is that there are a number of things that can be done to address the problem of obesity. One is to eat healthier foods. This means eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also means cutting back on processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats. Another is to get more exercise. This means getting at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n\nIf you are obese, it is important to talk to your doctor about a weight loss plan. There are a number of different weight loss plans available, and your doctor can help you find one that is right for you."
