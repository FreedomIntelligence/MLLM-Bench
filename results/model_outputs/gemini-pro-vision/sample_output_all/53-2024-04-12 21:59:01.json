The building is famous for its distinctive roof, which is made up of a series of interlocking concrete shells. The shells are supported by a complex system of steel ribs. The Sydney Opera House is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic buildings in the world.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is an expressionist building, which means that it was designed to evoke an emotional response in the viewer. The building's organic forms and soaring roofline are meant to suggest a sense of drama and excitement. The building is also a symbol of Australia's commitment to the arts.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is a complex and controversial building. It was over budget and behind schedule, and it was criticized by some for its unusual design. However, the building has since become one of the most beloved and recognizable buildings in the world. It is a testament to the genius of Jørn Utzon and the power of architecture to inspire and move us."
