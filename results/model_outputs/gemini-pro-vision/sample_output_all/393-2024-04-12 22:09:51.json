This led to the decline of the corset, and the rise of the flapper dress.\n\nAnother major social change that has influenced fashion trends is the increasing diversity of the population. As more and more people from different cultures immigrated to the United States, they brought their own unique styles with them. This has led to a more eclectic and diverse fashion landscape.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainability in fashion.
