The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff and opened in 1909. It is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the city.\n\nThe Manhattan Bridge is an example of a neo-Gothic architectural style. This style is characterized by its use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. The bridge is also made of steel, which was a new material at the time it was built."
