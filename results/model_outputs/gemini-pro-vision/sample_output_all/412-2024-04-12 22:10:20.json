The two domains are arranged in a V-shaped dimer, with the two four-helix bundles packed against each other in an antiparallel fashion. The overall structure of the protein is highly symmetrical, with the two domains being mirror images of each other.\n\nThe alpha helices are arranged in a four-helix bundle, with the helices running parallel to each other. The beta strands are arranged in a beta sheet, with the strands running antiparallel to each other. The beta sheet is located in the center of the protein, and the four-helix bundles are located on either side of the beta sheet.\n\nThere are several significant molecular interactions and binding sites that are visible in the structure of the protein. The most significant interaction is the binding of a calcium ion to the protein. The calcium ion is bound to the protein by two oxygen atoms from the side chain of an aspartic acid residue and one oxygen atom from the backbone of a glycine residue. The calcium ion is located in the center of the protein, and it is thought to play an important role in the stability of the protein.\n\nIn addition to the calcium ion, there are several other molecular interactions that are visible in the structure of the protein. These interactions include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic interactions. These interactions help to stabilize the structure of the protein and to allow it to function properly."
