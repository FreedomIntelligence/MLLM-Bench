This suggests that the person making the hiring decision is more likely to choose a white male candidate, even if there are other candidates who are more qualified.\n\nThis discriminatory practice can have a number of negative consequences. For example, it can lead to a lack of diversity in the workplace, which can stifle creativity and innovation. It can also lead to lower wages for women and minorities, as they are less likely to be promoted to higher-paying positions.\n\nThere are a number of things that can be done to address this issue. One is to implement blind hiring practices, where the hiring manager does not know the race, gender, or other personal characteristics of the candidate. Another is to provide training for hiring managers on how to avoid discrimination. Finally, it is important to create a culture of inclusion in the workplace, where everyone feels welcome and respected."
