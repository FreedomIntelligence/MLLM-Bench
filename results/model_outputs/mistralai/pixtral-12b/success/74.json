Bullfighting involves professional matadors, or toreros, engaging with bulls in an arena. The matadors wear elaborately decorated suits and use capes and swords in the performance. The event is significant in the context of Spanish cultural heritage, though it is also a subject of ethical debate due to the treatment of animals involved. The presence of the logo of animal rights organizations like ANIMANaturalis and PETA suggests ongoing controversy and advocacy against the practice.",
