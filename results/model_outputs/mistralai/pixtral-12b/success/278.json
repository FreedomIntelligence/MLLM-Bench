The next person to the right seems to be a shorter individual, likely a child, holding the hand of the adult, suggesting a close relationship such as parent and child. The other two shadows further to the right could be adults, possibly another parent and an older sibling or friend. The group's proximity and the act of holding hands indicate a close, familial relationship among the individuals.",
