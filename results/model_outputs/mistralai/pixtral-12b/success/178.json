Given that the image size is 1300x1300 pixels, we can approximate the coordinates. Here's an educated guess:\n\n- **Top-left corner (x, y):** (500, 100)\n- **Bottom-right corner (x, y):** (800, 300)\n\nThese coordinates suggest that the strawberry is located towards the top of the image and covers a portion of it. \n\nPlease note that these coordinates are approximate and should be verified with actual pixel measurements if precise localization is required.",
