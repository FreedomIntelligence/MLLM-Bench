    "answer": "To solve problem 11, we need to prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR. Given that triangles PQR and PUS are both equilateral, we know that all sides of these triangles are equal in length. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - Triangles PQR and PUS are equilateral.\n   - Therefore, PQ = QR = PR and PU = US = PS.\n\n2. **Determine the side lengths:**\n   - Since PQR is equilateral, PQ = QR = PR.\n   - Since PUS is equilateral, PU = US = PS.\n\n3. **Establish the congruence criteria:**\n   - To prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR, we need to show that PU = PS (which we already know from the equilateral triangles) and that PQ = SR.\n\n4. **Show that PQ = SR:**\n   - Notice that triangle PQR and triangle PSR share the side PR.\n   - Since PQR is equilateral, PR = QR.\n   - Since PSR is equilateral, PR = SR.\n   - Therefore, QR = SR.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have shown that PU = PS and PQ = SR.\n   - By the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion, triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.\n\nThus, we have proven that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.",
