    "answer": "To analyze the trend of change in the predicted graph, we need to observe the sequence of figures and identify the pattern or trend in the changes. Here’s a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Observation**:\n   - The top row shows a sequence of male figures, and the bottom row shows a sequence of female figures.\n   - Both sequences appear to depict a change in body weight or size.\n\n2. **Identifying the Trend**:\n   - For both the male and female figures, the trend is a gradual increase in body size or weight from left to right.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Change**:\n   - **Top Row (Male Figures)**:\n     - The first figure is the thinnest.\n     - The second figure is slightly thicker.\n     - The third figure is thicker than the second.\n     - The fourth figure is even thicker.\n     - The fifth figure is the thickest.\n   - **Bottom Row (Female Figures)**:\n     - The first figure is the thinnest.\n     - The second figure is slightly thicker.\n     - The third figure is thicker than the second.\n     - The fourth figure is even thicker.\n     - The fifth figure is the thickest.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Trend**:\n   - Both sequences show a progression from thinness to obesity. This suggests an increase in body size or weight.\n\n5. **Predicting the Next Trend**:\n   - Based on the given figures, the next figures in the sequence would likely continue the trend of increasing body size or weight.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The predicted trend is a continuous increase in body size or weight.\nThe predicted trend of change in the graph is a continuous increase in body size or weight.",
