    "answer": "The image quality is quite poor, likely due to several factors. The main issue appears to be blurriness, which could be caused by one or a combination of the following reasons:\n\n1. **Camera Settings**: The camera settings might not have been optimal for underwater photography. Factors such as incorrect focus, poor lighting conditions, or improper white balance settings can lead to blurriness.\n\n2. **Water Conditions**: The clarity of the water can significantly affect the image quality. Turbulent water, particles, or sediment can cause light to scatter, resulting in a blurred image.\n\n3. **Distance from Subject**: If the camera was too far from the subject or if the subject was moving quickly, it could result in a lack of focus and a blurry image.\n\n4. **Camera Equipment**: The use of a low-quality camera or lens, or the presence of scratches, dirt, or condensation on the camera's lens can also lead to poor image quality.\n\n5. **Post-Processing**: Inadequate post-processing techniques or software issues could also contribute to the blurriness seen in the image.\n\nGiven the underwater context, the most likely causes are poor lighting conditions, water clarity, and camera settings.",
