They are holding what appears to be a smartphone in their right hand.\n\nTo determine what they are holding, we need to observe the object closely. The object in their hand is rectangular and has a screen, which is characteristic of a smartphone. Additionally, the way they are holding it suggests they are interacting with the device, which further supports the idea that it is a smartphone.\n\nTherefore, the rightmost person is holding a smartphone in their right hand.",
