They do not produce their own shells but instead occupy abandoned shells from other animals, such as snails. This symbiotic relationship is essential for their survival, as they use these shells for protection from predators and environmental hazards. The image shows the hermit crab's soft body partially visible as it extends from the shell, highlighting its dependency on the shell for safety.",
