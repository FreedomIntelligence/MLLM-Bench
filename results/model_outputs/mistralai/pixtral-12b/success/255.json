    "answer": "To analyze the differences in species-specific features of the big cats illustrated in the image, we need to focus on each cat individually and compare their physical characteristics.\n\n1. **Top Left Cat (Tiger)**\n   - **Striped Coat:** Tigers have distinctive black or dark brown stripes on a lighter orange or yellowish-brown background.\n   - **Powerful Build:** Tigers have a muscular body with strong legs and a broad head.\n   - **Tail:** Tigers have a long tail with a thick black tip.\n\n2. **Top Right Cat (Lion)**\n   - **Mane:** Lions are easily recognizable by their mane, which is a thick ruff of hair around the neck and head. The mane can vary in color and thickness.\n   - **Body Color:** Lions usually have a tawny coat, though some can have darker or lighter fur.\n   - **Head Shape:** Lions have a broad head with a pronounced forehead and rounded ears.\n\n3. **Bottom Left Cat (Lioness)**\n   - **No Mane:** Unlike male lions, lionesses do not have a mane. They have a sleek head with short hair.\n   - **Smaller Size:** Lionesses are generally smaller and more slender than male lions.\n   - **Body Color:** Similar to male lions but often with a lighter coat.\n\n4. **Bottom Right Cat (Cheetah)**\n   - **Spotted Coat:** Cheetahs have a unique spotted coat, which helps them blend into their environment.\n   - **Lean Build:** Cheetahs have a slender, streamlined body designed for speed.\n   - **Tail:** Cheetahs have a long, thin tail with a white underside.\n   - **Ears:** Cheetahs have small, rounded ears.\n\nBy examining these features, we can distinguish between the different species of big cats present in the illustration.\nThe differences in species-specific features among the big cats in the image include:\n- **Tiger:** Striped coat, powerful build, long tail with a thick tip.\n- **Lion:** Mane, tawny coat, broad head.\n- **Lioness:** No mane, smaller size, tawny coat.\n- **Cheetah:** Spotted coat, lean build, long thin tail, small rounded ears.",
