    "answer": "The meme employs a type of humor known as irony. Irony here involves the contrast between the woman's stated dislike of dogs and the reality of her traveling with a dog in the back seat of the car. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the elements of humor:\n\n1. **Setup**: In the first panel, a man points out a dog while the woman expresses her dislike for dogs.\n   \n   - Man: \"Oh look at that dog\"\n   - Woman: \"I hate dogs\"\n\n2. **Reversal**: In the second panel, the same woman is seen in the back seat of a car with a dog sitting between her and the man driving.\n   \n   - The caption reads: \"This is the way!\"\n\n3. **Contrast**: The humor comes from the stark contrast between the woman's words (\"I hate dogs\") and her actions (traveling with a dog). This creates a sense of irony, as her dislike for dogs is juxtaposed with her actual situation.\n\n4. **Unexpected Twist**: The unexpected twist is that the woman who claims to hate dogs is now seen willingly (or unwillingly) sharing a car ride with one.\n\nThe humor lies in the unexpected and ironic situation that directly contradicts the woman's initial statement. This type of humor relies on the audience's recognition of the irony and the disconnect between what is said and what is actually happening.",
