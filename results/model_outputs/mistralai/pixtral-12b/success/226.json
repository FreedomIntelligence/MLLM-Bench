    "answer": "To map out the complex interdependencies between species in the forest food web, we need to analyze the relationships between producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, scavengers, decomposers, and detritus feeders.\n\n1. **Producers**: \n   - Green plants (e.g., trees) and fungi.\n\n2. **Primary Consumers** (Herbivores):\n   - Rabbit (eats green plants) \n   - Squirrel (eats green plants)\n\n3. **Secondary Consumers** (Carnivores):\n   - Fox (eats rabbit, mouse)\n   - Red-tailed hawk (eats mouse)\n\n4. **Scavengers**:\n   - Vulture (eats dead animals)\n\n5. **Decomposers**:\n   - Fungi and bacteria\n\n6. **Detritus Feeders**:\n   - Insects and worms (eat dead organic matter)\n\n**Interdependencies**:\n- Green plants are the primary energy source for primary consumers like the rabbit and squirrel.\n- The rabbit and mouse are prey for secondary consumers like the fox and red-tailed hawk.\n- The fox preys on both the rabbit and mouse.\n- Detritus feeders like insects and worms feed on dead organic matter, which is decomposed by fungi and bacteria.\n- Scavengers like vultures feed on dead animals.\n\n**Potential Cascade Effects**:\n1. **If the rabbit were to become extinct**:\n   - The fox would lose a significant food source, potentially leading to a decline in the fox population.\n   - The red-tailed hawk might also be affected if it relies on the rabbit as part of its diet.\n   - The vulture might have less carrion to consume.\n   - The decomposers and detritus feeders would have less dead organic matter from rabbits to decompose.\n\n2. **If the fox were to become extinct**:\n   - The rabbit and mouse populations might increase due to reduced predation.\n   - The red-tailed hawk might face less competition for food.\n   - The vulture might have to compete more for carrion with other scavengers.\n   - The decomposers and detritus feeders might have more organic matter to decompose due to increased mortality of primary consumers.\n\n3. **If the red-tailed hawk were to become extinct**:\n   - The mouse population might increase due to reduced predation.\n   - The fox might have more food available, leading to an increase in the fox population.\n   - The vulture might have less competition for carrion.\n\n4. **If the vulture were to become extinct**:\n   - Decomposition might be slower due to fewer scavengers removing dead animals.\n   - The decomposers and detritus feeders might have more organic matter to decompose.\n   - Other scavengers might face increased competition for carrion.\n\n5. **If the fungi were to become extinct**:\n   - Decomposition would be significantly impacted, leading to a buildup of dead organic matter.\n   - Detritus feeders would have less food.\n   - The entire ecosystem would be affected due to the critical role of fungi in decomposition.\nThe complex interdependencies in the forest food web include producers providing energy to primary consumers, secondary consumers preying on primary consumers, scavengers feeding on dead animals, and decomposers breaking down organic matter. Potential cascade effects from the extinction of one species could include shifts in population sizes of other species, changes in competition for resources, and alterations in the decomposition process.",
