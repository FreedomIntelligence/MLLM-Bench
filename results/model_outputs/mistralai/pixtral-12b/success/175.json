    "answer": "To determine the approximate coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3,\" we need to visually assess the image and estimate the position of the sign relative to the origin (0,0) and the dimensions provided.\n\nGiven the dimensions:\n- The width of the image is 675 units.\n- The height of the image is 900 units.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the sign for \"Lemons 6 for $3\" is located towards the top right corner of the fruit display. Based on the visual placement, we can estimate the coordinates of the sign.\n\n1. The sign is located near the top edge of the image.\n2. The sign is also towards the right side of the image.\n\nTo approximate:\n- The y-coordinate (vertical position) is close to the top, so it will be close to 900.\n- The x-coordinate (horizontal position) is towards the right, so it will be closer to 675.\n\nConsidering the exact placement visually, we can estimate:\n- The y-coordinate is around 850 to 870.\n- The x-coordinate is around 620 to 640.\n\nThus, the approximate coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are around (630, 860).",
