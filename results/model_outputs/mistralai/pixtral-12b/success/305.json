    "answer": "To determine which towel material exhibits greater water absorbency when new, we need to consider the properties of cotton and bamboo fibers.\n\n1. **Cotton**: Cotton towels are known for their high absorbency due to the natural structure of cotton fibers. Cotton fibers have a hollow core and a porous surface, which allows them to absorb and retain water effectively. This makes cotton towels highly when they are new.\n\n2. **Bamboo**: Bamboo towels, on the other hand, are made from bamboo fiber. While bamboo fiber is soft and gentle, it does not have the same absorbing capabilities as cotton. Bamboo fibers are not as porous, and their structure is less efficient at absorbing and retaining water compared to cotton fibers.\n\nGiven these properties, cotton towels generally exhibit greater water absorbency when they are new compared to bamboo towels.\n\n**Conclusion**: Cotton towels have greater water absorbency when new.",
