    "answer": "To improve the image quality, the photographer should consider using a faster shutter speed to better capture the motion of the subjects. Since the current image is blurry, a quicker shutter speed would help freeze the motion of the woman walking and the other people in the background, making them appear sharper and more defined. Additionally, ensuring proper lighting and possibly using a tripod or stabilizing the camera can further enhance the image quality.",
