    "answer": "The image depicts a warthog with several oxpeckers perched on its back and one perched on its tusk. This interaction is an example of mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship where both species benefit from the interaction.\n\n### Benefits to the Oxpecker:\n1. **Feeding Opportunity**: Oxpeckers feed on ticks, dead skin, and other parasites found on the warthog's skin. This provides the oxpeckers with a ready source of food without the need to expend energy searching for it.\n2. **Protection**: By perching on the warthog, the oxpeckers gain a vantage point to spot predators from a distance. This early warning system can help them avoid becoming prey themselves.\n\n### Benefits to the Warthog:\n1. **Parasite Removal**: The oxpeckers help keep the warthog free of ticks and other parasites, which can cause irritation, disease, and even death if left untreated. This grooming helps maintain the warthog's health.\n2. **Health Monitoring**: The presence of oxpeckers can also alert the warthog to any wounds or infections on its body that may need attention. The birds' activity around these areas can draw the warthog's attention to them.\n\n### Summary:\nThe relationship between the oxpecker and warthog is mutually beneficial. The oxpeckers gain an easy source of food and protection, while the warthog benefits from parasite removal and early health monitoring. This symbiotic relationship allows both species to thrive in their shared environment.",
