This area is well-lit with natural light from the windows and supplemented by a floor lamp, providing ample illumination for working. Additionally, the desk has storage space and shelves above it, which can be used to store office supplies and books, making it a functional workspace. The location is also close to the main entrance, offering easy access and a sense of openness due to the nearby windows, which can help reduce feelings of isolation while working.",
