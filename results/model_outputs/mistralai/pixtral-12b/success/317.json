Let's go through each equation step by step:\n\n1. \\( a^{3}: a^{5}=a^{3-5}=a^{-2}= \\frac{1}{a^{2}} \\quad (a \\neq 0) \\)\n   - This equation is correct.

Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, regardless of whether it is \\( (0.0001)^{0} \\) or \\( (100000)^{0} \\).\n\n3. \\( m^{3}: m^{3}=m^{3-3}=m^{0}=1 \\)\n   - This equation is correct.
