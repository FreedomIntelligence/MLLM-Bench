In contrast, Mars appears reddish-brown with minimal cloud cover, indicating a thin atmosphere with very little water vapor and a much colder climate. Earth's surface features include large oceans and extensive cloud patterns, while Mars shows signs of dry, dusty terrain with fewer atmospheric disturbances.",
