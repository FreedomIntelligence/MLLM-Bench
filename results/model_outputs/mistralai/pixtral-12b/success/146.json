    "answer": "The meme features two images of a cat, one labeled \"BEFORE COFFEE\" and the other \"AFTER COFFEE.\" \n\n1. **Exaggeration in Expression:**\n   - **Before Coffee:** The cat in the first image appears to have a neutral to slightly unhappy expression. Its eyes are normal, and its mouth is closed, giving it a somewhat disinterested or grumpy look.\n   - **After Coffee:** The cat in the second image looks dramatically different. Its eyes are wide open, almost bulging, and its mouth is open with its tongue sticking out, giving it a highly exaggerated, almost comical expression of alertness or excitement.\n\n2. **Hyperbole Contribution to Humor:**\n   - **Contrast:** The meme uses the extreme contrast between the two expressions to highlight how one's mood or energy level can change after consuming coffee. This is a common trope in humor, where the exaggeration makes the point more comedic.\n   - **Relatability:** Many people can relate to feeling tired or grumpy before having their morning coffee and then feeling more alert and energetic afterward. The exaggerated depiction accentuates this common experience, making it humorous.\n   - **Visual Impact:** The drastic change in the cat's facial features is visually striking and amusing, which adds to the humor. The wide eyes and open mouth create a cartoonish effect, making the meme more entertaining.\n\nOverall, the exaggeration in the cat's expression after \"coffee\" contributes to the humor by highlighting a relatable experience in a visually exaggerated and comedic manner.\n",
