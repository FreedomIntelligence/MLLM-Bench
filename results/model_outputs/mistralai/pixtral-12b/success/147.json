    "answer": "The humorous effect in the meme is primarily derived from the juxtaposition of the text and the image. The text reads, \"When payday lands and you start buying unnecessary things,\" suggesting a scenario where someone impulsively spends their paycheck on frivolous items. The image shows a dog standing next to a painting of a dog dressed in formal attire, which adds a whimsical and unexpected element.\n\n### Elements Contributing to the Humorous Effect:\n1. **Text**: The text sets up an expectation of financial irresponsibility and frivolous spending.\n2. **Painting**: The painting of a dog in formal attire is unusual and humorous.\n3. **Dog's Expression**: The dog in the image has a somewhat confused or amused expression, which adds to the humor.\n\n### Backstory:\nImagine a family where the owner recently received their paycheck. In the excitement of having money, the owner decided to splurge on some unnecessary purchases, including artwork. They stumbled upon a quirky painting of a dog dressed in formal wear and thought it would be a fun addition to their home. The painting was more expensive than they had anticipated, but the owner couldn't resist the whimsy and purchased it anyway.\n\nWhen the owner brought the painting home, their dog was curious and somewhat bewildered by the new addition. The dog's confusion at seeing another dog in formal attire, juxtaposed with the owner's extravagant purchase, created a humorous scene. The owner took a picture of the dog standing next to the painting, capturing the moment of financial folly and the dog's bemused reaction.\n\nThe meme captures this moment, highlighting the humor in both the unnecessary purchase and the dog's amusing expression, reinforcing the lighthearted nature of the situation.\n",
