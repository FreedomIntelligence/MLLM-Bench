    "answer": "### Topic of the Speech\nThe topic of the speech is the importance and necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.\n\n### Rhetorical Codes Used in the Speech\n\n1. **Ethos (Ethical Appeal)**\n   - **Einstein Quote**: The speaker uses a quote from Einstein to emphasize that learning is about using the mind, not just memorizing facts. This adds credibility and intellectual depth to the argument.\n   - **Personal Experience**: The speaker shares stories of students from poor families who worked hard to get into top universities, illustrating the potential for personal growth and success through hard work.\n\n2. **Pathos (Emotional Appeal)**\n   - **Fairness and Opportunity**: The speaker highlights the fairness of the exams by emphasizing that they level the playing field, disregarding family background and wealth.\n   - **Stress Management**: The speaker acknowledges the stress associated with the exams but frames it as a beneficial preparation for future challenges.\n\n3. **Logos (Logical Appeal)**\n   - **Arguments for Fairness**: The speaker argues that without exams, admission would likely be based on family conditions and social status, which is unfair to less privileged students.\n   - **Benefit to Students**: The speaker presents the exams as a means to help students grow and learn problem-solving skills, not just as a hurdle to overcome.\n\n4. **Anaphora**\n   - The speaker uses the phrase \"These exams, however\" twice to emphasize the fairness and benefits of the exams despite common criticisms.\n\n5. **Hypophora**\n   - The speaker asks rhetorical questions such as \"How would you get into college?\" to engage the audience and lead them to the logical conclusion that exams are necessary.\n\n6. **Metaphor**\n   - The speaker uses the metaphor \"keys to the future\" to highlight the significance of the exams, suggesting they are a means to unlock future opportunities.\n\nBy combining these rhetorical codes, the speaker effectively argues for the necessity of college entrance exams, appealing to the audience's sense of fairness, logic, and emotional connection to the topic.",
