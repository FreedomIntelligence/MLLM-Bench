    "answer": "The exercise in the image is the bench press. The bench press is a fundamental weightlifting exercise that primarily targets the chest muscles (pectorals), but also engages the shoulders (deltoids) and triceps. To perform a bench press correctly, the individual should lie on their back on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor. They should grip the barbell with both hands, positioning their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. The barbell is then lowered to the chest, touching lightly, and then pressed back up to the starting position while maintaining control and proper form. Proper technique is essential to avoid injury and maximize gains in upper body strength and muscle development.",
