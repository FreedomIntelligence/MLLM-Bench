    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the type of cells pointed by labeled arrows.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows cells with labeled arrows pointing to them, likely indicating specific features or characteristics of the cells. However, without additional context or specific descriptions of the cells, it is difficult to definitively determine the type of cells pointed by the labeled arrows. The cells could be red blood cells, white blood cells, or any other type of cell in the context of a microscope slide.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the type of cells pointed by labeled arrows, we need to analyze the characteristics of each cell and compare them with known types of cells found in a blood smear.\n\n1. **Cell A**: This cell has a large, round nucleus with a dense chromatin pattern. The cytoplasm is minimal. This is indicative of a lymphocyte, which is a type of white blood cell (leukocyte) known for its role in the immune system.\n\n2. **Cell B**: This cell has multiple lobes with a pink-stained cytoplasm and a central nucleus. This is characteristic of a neutrophil, another type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune response and has a multi-lobed nucleus.\n\n3. **Cell C**: This cell has a horseshoe-shaped nucleus with a clear cytoplasm. This is typical of a band neutrophil, which is an immature form of a neutrophil.\n\n4. **Cell D**: This cell has a large, irregular nucleus with a blue-stained cytoplasm. This is indicative of a myelocyte, which is an immature white blood cell often seen in bone marrow and sometimes in peripheral blood in certain conditions.\n\n5. **Cell E**: This cell has a large, round nucleus with a dense chromatin pattern and minimal cytoplasm. This resembles a proerythroblast, an early stage of red blood cell (erythroid) precursor.\n\n6. **Cell F**: This cell has a small, round nucleus with scant cytoplasm. This is indicative of a normoblast, a late stage of red blood cell precursor.\n\n7. **Cell G**: This cell has a large, irregular nucleus with dense staining. This resembles a metamyelocyte, another stage of neutrophil maturation.\n\n8. **Cell H**: This cell has a large, irregular nucleus and a blue-stained cytoplasm. This is indicative of a promyelocyte, an early stage of neutrophil development.\n\nBy analyzing the characteristics of each cell, we can identify the type of cell pointed by each labeled arrow.\nCell A:ocyte\nCell B: Neutrophil\nCell C: Band Neutrophil\nCell D: Myelocyte\nCell E: Proerythroblast\nCell F: Normoblast\nCell G: Metamyelocyte\nCell H: Promyelocyte\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify and match each labeled arrow (A-H) with the cell types from the reference.\n2. Answer must specify the type of cell for each label without ambiguity or error.",
