    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the series of actions in the image and predict the possible next action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a series of actions, starting with a ball above each person or symbol. From this observation, it can be inferred that the possible next action might be the ball either falling or moving towards the person, symbol, or ball to initiate the next action of the sequence. The current actions in the image involve the interaction between the ball, persons, and symbols, suggesting that this scene might be a representation of a sports game, gymnastics, or a martial arts performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a sequence of actions involving a person interacting with a table and a chair. Each frame (T1 to T5) shows a specific stage of the interaction. Let's analyze the sequence step-by-step:\n\n1. **T1**: The person appears to be reaching over the table, with one hand on the table and the other hand raised, possibly holding or reaching for an object.\n2. **T2**: The person's hand on the table moves closer to the edge, and the other hand is now positioned higher, suggesting an upward motion.\n3. **T3**: The person's hand on the table is now fully extended, and the raised hand is above the table, indicating a lifting or throwing action.\n4. **T4**: The person's hand on the table is now withdrawn, and the raised hand is positioned lower, suggesting the object has been released or thrown.\n5. **T5**: The person is standing up from the chair, indicating a change in posture or the end of the activity.\n\nGiven this sequence, the next action could be one of the following:\n\n- **Standing Up Completely**: The person might fully stand up from the chair, possibly to leave or to interact with something else in the room.\n- **Moving Away from the Table**: The person might step back from the table, indicating that the activity is complete.\n- **Picking Up Another Object**: The person might reach for another object on the table or the floor, continuing the interaction.\n\nBased on the sequence and the positions, the most likely next action is:\n\n**Standing Up Completely**\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the sequence of actions leading up to the last depicted moment.\n2. Predict the next action based on the momentum and position of figures.\n3. Ensure prediction is plausible within the context of the image sequence.",
