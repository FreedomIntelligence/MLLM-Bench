Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnswer the question marks in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of math problems with the numbers 1 through 12, and some of them are missing. The missing numbers are represented by question marks. To answer the question, find the mathematical expression corresponding to each missing number based on the context of the problem.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSure! Let's solve the equations step by step based on the given image.\n\n1. \\(\\text{circle} + \\text{triangle} = 8\\)\n2. \\(\\text{circle} - \\text{triangle} = 4\\)\n3. \\(\\text{star} + \\text{square} = 12\\)\n4. \\(\\text{star} - \\text{square} = \\text{square}\\)\n5. \\(\\text{square} + \\text{square} = \\text{star}\\)\n\nFirst, let's denote the values of the shapes:\n- \\(\\text{circle} = c\\)\n- \\(\\text{triangle} = t\\)\n- \\(\\text{star} = s\\)\n- \\(\\text{square} = q\\)\n\nNow, let's write the equations in terms of these variables:\n\n1. \\(c + t = 8\\)\n2. \\(c - t = 4\\)\n3. \\(s + q = 12\\)\n4. \\(s - q = q\\)\n5. \\(q + q = s\\)\n\nFrom equation 4, we can simplify:\n\\[ s - q = q \\]\n\\[ s = 2q \\]\n\nNow, use this in equation 5:\n\\[ q + q = s \\]\n\\[ 2q = s \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(s = 2q\\) into equation 3:\n\\[ 2q + q = 12 \\]\n\\[ 3q = 12 \\]\n\\[ q = 4 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\text{square} = 4\\).\n\nNow, substitute \\(q = 4\\) back into equation 5:\n\\[ 4 + 4 = s \\]\n\\[ s = 8 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\text{star} = 8\\).\n\nNow, use the values of \\(s\\) and \\(q\\) in equations 1 and 2:\n1. \\(c + t = 8\\)\n2. \\(c - t = 4\\)\n\nAdd these two equations:\n\\[ (c + t) + (c - t) = 8 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 2c = 12 \\]\n\\[ c = 6 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\text{circle} = 6\\).\n\nNow, substitute \\(c = 6\\) back into equation 1:\n\\[ 6 + t = 8 \\]\n\\[ t = 2 \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\text{triangle} = 2\\).\n\nNow we can fill in the values for the shapes with question marks:\n\n- \\(\\text{star} = 8\\)\n- \\(\\text{circle} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\text{triangle} = 2\\)\n- \\(\\text{square} = 4\\)\n\nThus, the answers are:\n- \\(\\text{star} = 8\\)\n- \\(\\text{circle} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\text{triangle} = 2\\)\n- \\(\\text{square} = 4\\)\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the value of the star based on the given equations and reference.\n2. Accurately calculates the values of circle, square, and triangle using visual math reasoning.\n3. Answers are consistent with reference: star = 8, circle = 6, square = 4, triangle = 2.",
