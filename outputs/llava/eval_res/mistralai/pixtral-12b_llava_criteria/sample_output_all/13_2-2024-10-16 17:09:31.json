    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a receipt from 'Receiptify', an application that generates a music listening receipt based on a user's listening history. Based on the image, what is the number of times the song Future(Lollapalooza ver.) was played?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe receipt shows the number of times each song was played. To find out how many times the song \"Future (Lollapalooza ver.)\" was played, we need to locate the entry for this song on the receipt and note the quantity listed next to it.\n\nThe song \"Future (Lollapalooza ver.)\" appears twice on the receipt. The quantities listed are 271 and 251.\n\nAdding these quantities together gives us the total number of times the song was played.\n\n271 + 251 = 522\n\nSo, the song \"Future (Lollapalooza ver.)\" was played 522 times.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe number of times the song Future(Lollapalooza ver.) was played is 3.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the song \"Future (Lollapalooza ver.)\" is correctly identified and its play count.\n2. Check OCR accuracy for the number of times played against the reference: 271.",
