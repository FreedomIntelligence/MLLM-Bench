    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side closely to identify and compare the differences between them as much as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are two different representations of a puppy on a leash carrying a backpack. The two images can be distinguished by analyzing the expressions of the cute puppy. While the puppy is walking, it has a distinctive smile on its face, indicating that it is happy and enjoying the moment. In various locations throughout the images, you can also see the grass on the ground, adding to the visual context of the scene. The two different expressions of the puppy and the overall atmosphere in both pictures can be compared, highlighting the variations in their expressions and the overall scene they depict.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nCertainly! Let's carefully examine the images on the left-hand side and the right-hand side and compare the differences.\n\n### Left-hand Side Image:\n1. **Characters**: \n   - There are two anthropomorphic dogs.\n   - The dog on the left is holding a book and appears to be speaking.\n   - The dog on the right is gesturing with its right hand raised and listening attentively.\n\n2. **Setting**:\n   - Both dogs are standing on grass.\n   - The background includes some grass and a clear sky.\n\n3. **Pose and Expression**:\n   - The dog on the left has its mouth open, indicating it is speaking.\n   - The dog on the right has a smile and its eyes are focused on the left dog.\n\n### Right-hand Side Image:\n1. **Characters**: \n   - There are two anthropomorphic dogs, identical to the ones on the left.\n   - The dog on the left is holding a book and appears to be speaking.\n   - The dog on the right is gesturing with its right hand raised and listening attentively.\n\n2. **Setting**:\n   - Both dogs are standing on grass.\n   - The background includes some grass and a clear sky.\n\n3. **Pose and Expression**:\n   - The dog on the left has its mouth open, indicating it is speaking.\n   - The dog on the right has a smile and its eyes are focused on the left dog.\n\n### Differences:\n1. **Visual Elements**:\n   - The left-hand side image and the right-hand side image are identical in every aspect. \n   - There are no differences in the poses, expressions, or setting between the two images.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth images are identical in all respects. There are no differences between the left-hand side and the right-hand side images.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences: eye color, belt, shirt stripes, facial hair, eyebrow, socks, left dog's bag, left dog's eyelash, left dog's mouth wrinkle.\n2. Ensure all differences listed in the reference are mentioned accurately.\n3. Compare both images for any additional differences not listed in the reference.",
