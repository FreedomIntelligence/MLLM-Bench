    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image showcases the evolution of official presidential automobiles from 1909 to 1950, highlighting various models used by different U.S. presidents. From the steam-powered cars of the early 20th century to the sleek, advanced designs of the 1950s, the image illustrates significant advancements in automotive technology, style, and functionality.\n\nKey observations from the image include:\n\n1. **Early 20th Century (1909-1919)**: The cars were primarily steam-powered or electric, reflecting the technological innovations of the time. These vehicles were simpler in design and smaller in size compared to modern standards.\n   \n2. **1920s-1930s**: Cars became more sophisticated with the introduction of gasoline-powered engines. Designs became more streamlined, and vehicles began to incorporate luxury features. The Pierce-Arrow and Cadillac models from this era exemplify the transition towards more refined and stylish automobiles.\n\n3. **1940s-1950s**: The automotive designs became increasingly sleek and modern. The Lincoln and Cadillac models from this period feature smoother lines, larger sizes, and more advanced engineering, reflecting the growing emphasis on comfort, performance, and aesthetics.\n\nFrom these observations, future automotive design trends can be inferred as follows:\n\n1. **Continued Emphasis on Technology**: As seen in the evolution from steam and electric to gasoline-powered vehicles, future cars will likely incorporate advanced technologies such as electric powertrains, autonomous driving, and connectivity features.\n\n2. **Sleek and Aerodynamic Designs**: The trend towards sleeker, more designs will continue, aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing environmental impact.\n\n3. **Increased Focus on Luxury and Comfort**: Future cars will likely incorporate advanced materials, sophisticated interiors, and cutting-edge infotainment systems to enhance the driving experience.\n\n4. **Sustainability**: With a growing emphasis on environmental concerns, future designs will prioritize sustainability, including the use of renewable materials and the development of zero-emission vehicles.\n\nIn summary, future automotive design evolution will likely be characterized by technological advancements, sleek and designs, a focus on luxury and comfort, and a commitment to sustainability.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
