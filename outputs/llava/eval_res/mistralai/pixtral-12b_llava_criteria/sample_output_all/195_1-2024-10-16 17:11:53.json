    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the visual symptoms in detail and estimate the stage of the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a young child is looking at the camera with red spots on their skin, particularly on their face. These red spots are likely indicative of a rash or an outbreak of hives. Hives are often caused by an allergic reaction, irritation, or an infection. It is difficult to precisely determine the stage of the condition from the image alone, as the severity, size, and distribution of the rash can vary. However, given that the child is looking at the camera, it is possible that the rash is not too severe or extensive, allowing the child to maintain focus and comfort in the presence of the photographer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a young child with visible symptoms on their face, including redness and inflammation. The skin appears to be irritated and has multiple red patches, which could be indicative of a skin condition such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or an allergic reaction. The redness is prominent, particularly on the cheeks and chin, and the skin looks dry and possibly scaly. There may also be some swelling or puffiness around the affected areas.\n\nEstimating the stage of the condition is challenging without further context, but the intensity of the redness and inflammation suggests that it might be in an active or acute phase. If left untreated, this condition could worsen, leading to more severe symptoms such as increased discomfort, itching, and potential secondary infections if the skin is broken.\n\nMedical advice should be sought to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment for the condition.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe visible skin symptoms (e.g., rash, discoloration).\n2. Estimate condition stage based on visual symptoms severity.\n3. Include no diagnosis, focus on symptom description and stage estimation.",
