    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify potential humorous elements within the image, and create a humorous caption for the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humorous element in the image is the man with a backpack on his back seemingly having trouble balancing on the small scooter. Riding a scooter could be challenging, especially if the man is not used to it. The fact that the man is wearing a backpack might also add a playful element to the scene, as he rides quickly down the street, possibly struggling to maintain his balance.\n\nA humorous caption for this image could be: \"The man with the backpack races to catch the bus, but the scooter might not be fast enough to keep up with his schedule.\"\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image portrays a man riding a small, child-sized scooter, leaning forward with determination, and wearing a backpack. The humorous element lies in the mismatch between the man's size and the scooter's size, making it look both comical and slightly absurd.\n\nCaption: \"When they said 'ride like a kid again,' I didn't realize it would be THIS literal!\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Trying to relive childhood one wobbly scooter ride at a time. Adulting is tough, folks!\"\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes a humorous take on the adult riding a child's scooter.\n2. Humor relates to the contrast between the rider's intense expression and the playful activity.\n3. Caption is creative, contextually relevant to the image, and evokes amusement.",
