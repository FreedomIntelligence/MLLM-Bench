    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a story based on the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heart of a vibrant and imaginative room, a young girl named Lily was tucked into her cozy bed, her eyes with curiosity and wonder. Her room was a magical place, filled with toys and books that sparked her creativity. Among her favorite playmates were her two loyal dogs, Max and Bella, who were always ready for an adventure.\n\nOne evening, as Lily was settling down to sleep, she noticed a peculiar cloud hovering over her bed. This was no ordinary cloud, for it had a thought bubble floating above it, displaying a mathematical equation: 7 x 5 = 35. Intrigued, Lily reached out her hand and touched the cloud. Suddenly, she found herself in a whimsical classroom, where she was surrounded by her toys.\n\nAt the front of the classroom, a friendly dog was leading a lesson, explaining the multiplication concept with enthusiasm. Lily watched as her toys interacted, learning and practicing their math skills. She saw her teddy bear, Thomas, carefully writing numbers on his chalkboard, while her doll, Emily, was enthusiastically raising her hand to answer a question.\n\nIntrigued by the lesson, Lily joined in, eagerly participating and asking questions. She loved how the classroom was filled with fun and laughter, making learning feel like play. As the lesson came to an end, the dog instructor praised Lily and her toys for their excellent efforts.\n\nFeeling proud and inspired, Lily returned to her room, where she found Max and Bella waiting for her. She shared her exciting adventure with them, explaining what she had learned about multiplication. The dogs wagged their tails in approval, happy to see Lily enjoying her newfound knowledge.\n\nFrom that day forward, Lily's love for math grew stronger. She continued to learn and explore, her imagination fueled by the magical experiences she shared with her toys and pets. And every night, as she lay in her bed, she would watch for the thought clouds, eager to embark on another adventure in learning.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, we see a dog sitting on a mat, surrounded by an airplane and airplane toys. The dog seems to be resting and enjoying the cozy airplane-inspired bed. There are books scattered around the room, indicating that this space might be used for play, relaxation, or learning.\n\nIt's possible that the dog's owner is nearby, engaged in some activity or enjoying a meal, as there are two carrots visible on the floor, likely meant for sharing with the dog. A cup can also be seen on the floor, suggesting that the person might be having a drink while spending time with the dog.\n\nAs we look closer at the scene, we notice that the dog is carrying a book, adding a playful touch to the scene. The books' presence, along with the airplane toys, creates an imaginative and creative environment for the dog and its owner to enjoy.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes boy dreaming about math, dog attending school, and bedroom setting.\n2. Narrative coherence; beginning, middle, and end structured around the image.\n3. Creative elements that enhance the visual elements without altering them.",
