    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humorous effect in the meme is primarily derived from the juxtaposition of the text and the image. The text reads, \"When payday lands and you start buying unnecessary things,\" suggesting a scenario where someone impulsively spends their paycheck on frivolous items. The image shows a dog standing next to a painting of a dog dressed in formal attire, which adds a whimsical and unexpected element.\n\n### Elements Contributing to the Humorous Effect:\n1. **Text**: The text sets up an expectation of financial irresponsibility and frivolous spending.\n2. **Painting**: The painting of a dog in formal attire is unusual and humorous.\n3. **Dog's Expression**: The dog in the image has a somewhat confused or amused expression, which adds to the humor.\n\n### Backstory:\nImagine a family where the owner recently received their paycheck. In the excitement of having money, the owner decided to splurge on some unnecessary purchases, including artwork. They stumbled upon a quirky painting of a dog dressed in formal wear and thought it would be a fun addition to their home. The painting was more expensive than they had anticipated, but the owner couldn't resist the whimsy and purchased it anyway.\n\nWhen the owner brought the painting home, their dog was curious and somewhat bewildered by the new addition. The dog's confusion at seeing another dog in formal attire, juxtaposed with the owner's extravagant purchase, created a humorous scene. The owner took a picture of the dog standing next to the painting, capturing the moment of financial folly and the dog's bemused reaction.\n\nThe meme captures this moment, highlighting the humor in both the unnecessary purchase and the dog's amusing expression, reinforcing the lighthearted nature of the situation.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
