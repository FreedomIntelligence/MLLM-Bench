    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image can be explained by examining the elements that contribute to the joke. \n\n1. **Cat's Position**: The cat is curled up in a tight, almost comical ball. This position is unusual for cats, as they typically prefer to stretch out or curl up loosely. The exaggerated, tightly wound position adds a whimsical and element.\n\n2. **Cat's Expression**: The cat appears to be asleep or in a deep state of relaxation. The peaceful expression contrasts with the unusual body position, making the scene more amusing.\n\n3. **Cardboard Box**: The cat is lying on a simple cardboard box. Cats are famously known for their love of boxes, but the mundane nature of the box adds to the humor by highlighting the cat's contentment with a minimalistic and ordinary setting.\n\n4. **Text Overlay**: The text \"MONDAYS...\" is overlaid at the top of the image. The ellipsis suggests a continuation or a completion of a thought, implying that Mondays are a time when one might feel similarly exhausted or in need of hiding away, much like the cat's pose suggests.\n\n5. **Relatability**: The combination of these elements creates a relatable scenario for many people who might feel similarly drained or in need of a break on Mondays. The image uses the cat's behavior as a metaphor for human emotions.\n\nOverall, the humor in the image comes from the juxtaposition of the cat's unusual pose, its peaceful expression, the simplicity of the cardboard box, and the relatable sentiment expressed in the text.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
