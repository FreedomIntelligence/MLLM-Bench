    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image appears to be a humorous take on the evolution of humans, starting from early primates to modern humans. The progression shows early primates, followed by more human-like figures using primitive tools, and ending with a modern individual holding a remote control. \n\nTo analyze the trend:\n1. **Early Stage**: The first figure represents early primates, indicating the beginning of human evolution.\n2. **Tool Use**: The second and third figures show the use of primitive tools, suggesting the development of tool-using capabilities.\n3. **Clothing**: The fourth figure wears a loincloth, indicating the development of basic clothing.\n4. **Complex Tools**: The fifth figure uses a more advanced tool, hinting at the development of more complex technology.\n5. **Modern Technology**: The final figure holds a remote control, representing modern technological advancements.\n\nPredicting the next stage:\nGiven the trend, the next stage would logically involve an even more advanced piece of modern technology. This could be a smartphone, a virtual reality headset, or any other high-tech gadget that represents the current state of advanced technology and digital interaction.\n\nSo, the next stage in this humorous evolution might depict a figure using a smartphone or another advanced technological device.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
