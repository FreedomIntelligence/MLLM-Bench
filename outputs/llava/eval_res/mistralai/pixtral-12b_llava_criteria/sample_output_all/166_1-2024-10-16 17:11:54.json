    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main point of the headline is that anti-Israel activists have engaged in acts of vandalism, specifically ripping down posters that were likely hosted in a public space. The headline reads: \"Anti-Israel activists rip down hostility posters in petty acts of hate.\"\n\nTo understand the broader context, we need to consider the following elements:\n\n1. **Anti-Israel Activism**: Anti-Israel activism can encompass a wide range of views and actions, including opposition to Israeli policies and actions, support for Palestinian rights, and criticism of Israeli government policies.\n\n2. **Hostility Posters**: The term \"hostility posters\" suggests that the posters in question were likely pro-Israel or critical of Palestinians and their supporters. This implies that the posters were controversial and could be seen as inflammatory by some.\n\n3. **Petty Acts of Hate**: The phrase \"petty acts of hate\" suggests that the activists' actions were seen as malicious and intended to provoke a reaction rather than engage in constructive dialogue.\n\n4. **Decency and Shredding of Posters**: The phrase \"Not a shred of decency\" indicates a strong condemnation of the activists' behavior, suggesting that their actions were seen as undignified and disrespectful.\n\n5. **Hamas Vows**: The mention of Hamas vows to kill Jews \"again and again\" adds a layer of context, likely referring to recent geopolitical tensions or conflicts between Israel and Hamas. Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist organization designated as a terrorist group by several countries, including the United States.\n\nIn summary, the headline is highlighting the actions of anti-Israel activists who vandalized posters, which is framed as a petty and undignified act of hate. This action is set against the backdrop of ongoing tensions and conflicts between Israel and groups like Hamas, which have made statements threatening Israeli civilians. The broader context involves deep-rooted political and ideological differences that have manifested in various forms of conflict and activism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3. Assess relevance and accuracy of external knowledge used in explanation.",
