    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heart of a vast, desolate landscape, there lies an open road, stretching into the unknown, its path veiled by a thick, ethereal fog. The road, a symbol of life's journey, is marked by a single, bold yellow line that bisects its expanse, guiding the traveler through the uncertainty that lies ahead.\n\nOne day, a man finds himself at the road's edge, his heart pounding with anticipation and a mix of trepidation. He has spent years in the same place, bound by routine and familiarity. Yet, a deep-seated longing for something more, something unknown, has begun to stir within him. This longing, coupled with a sudden burst of courage, prompts him to step onto the road.\n\nAs he walks, the fog around him seems to part, revealing just enough of the path to keep him moving forward. The air is cool and damp, carrying with it a sense of mystery and promise. The man, dressed in dark, casual attire, begins to run, his feet pounding the asphalt, echoing the rhythm of his heart. He feels alive, free from the constraints of his past, embracing the unknown that lies before him.\n\nWith each stride, he leaves behind the familiar and embraces the unfamiliar. The fog, once a barrier, now becomes a veil of intrigue, obscuring the challenges and opportunities that await him. The yellow line serves as his compass, guiding him through the twists and turns of his journey.\n\nAs he runs, he leaps into the air, his body suspended in a moment of pure exhilaration. Time seems to stand still as he soars above the road, his spirit soaring with him. This leap, this fleeting moment of weightlessness, embodies the freedom and joy he finds in letting go of the past and embracing the unknown.\n\nThe open road, shrouded in fog, becomes a metaphor for life's journey. It symbolizes new beginnings, unknown adventures, and the courage to step into the unknown. The man's leap represents the willingness to take risks, to embrace change, and to find freedom in uncertainty. As he lands and continues his journey, he knows that the road ahead is uncertain, but he is ready to face whatever comes his way, guided by the yellow line of hope and the spirit of adventure.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3. Incorporates the visual of the person jumping as part of the narrative.",
