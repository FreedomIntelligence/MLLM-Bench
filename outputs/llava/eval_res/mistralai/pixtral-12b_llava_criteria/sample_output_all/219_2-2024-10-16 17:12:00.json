Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the metal that has the biggest price change in the heat map?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo determine which metal has the biggest price change in the heat map, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the metals section**: The metals are listed under the 'METALS' category in the heat map.\n\n2. **Examine the price changes**: The metals and their respective price changes are:\n   - Platinum: -2.4%\n   - Gold: -1.28%\n   - High Grade Copper: -1.93%\n   - Palladium: -2.56%\n   - Silver: -3.60%\n\n3. **Compare the price changes**: We need to find the metal with the most significant percentage change. By comparing the values:\n   - Platinum: -2.4%\n   - Gold: -1.28%\n   - High Grade Copper: -1.93%\n   - Palladium: -2.56%\n   - Silver: -3.60%\n\n4. **Determine the largest change**: The largest percentage change is -3.60%, which corresponds to Silver.\n\nTherefore, the metal with the biggest price change in the heat map is **Silver**.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the heat map, the metal with the biggest price change is gold.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the metal with the largest percentage change in the Metals section as silver.\n2. Specify the percentage change of silver as -3.60%.",
