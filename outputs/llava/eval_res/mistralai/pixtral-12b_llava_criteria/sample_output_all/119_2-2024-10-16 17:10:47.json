    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotion conveyed by the statue and analyze any symbolism that might be associated with the serenity of the expression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe statue in the image conveys a sense of calm and serenity through its expression. The closed eyes and slight smile suggest a state of peace and tranquility, often associated with spiritual or meditative states.\n\nSymbolically, the serene expression can be interpreted as representing inner peace, enlightenment, or spiritual attainment. This is commonly seen in statues of deities or religious figures, which are often depicted with serene faces to convey the idea of transcendence and spiritual purity. The closed eyes can signify the closing off of worldly distractions and the focus on inner peace or divine connection.\n\nThe headdress and ornate attire, including the intricate designs and vibrant colors, further emphasize the statue's significance, possibly indicating its representation of a divine or revered figure. The use of red, white, and gold colors may symbolize different aspects of spirituality or divinity, such as purity, enlightenment, and sacredness.\n\nOverall, the serene expression and symbolic attire communicate themes of inner peace, spirituality, and divine connection.\nThe serene expression on the statue's face symbolizes inner peace, enlightenment, and spiritual attainment, often representing a divine or revered figure in a state of transcendence and purity.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe statue displays a serene and calm expression, as the woman's eyes are half closed, and her lips are together in a peaceful manner. This peacefulness in the statue could symbolize various aspects such as tranquility, inner peace, contentment, or even enlightenment. The statue's serene expression is likely meant to evoke a sense of calmness and harmony, encouraging viewers to connect with their own inner peace and quiet reflection. The decorative headpiece and the overall design of the statue further emphasize the harmony and balance that the figure represents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotion of the statue's expression as serene, peaceful, or similar.\n2. Analyze symbolism related to the statue's serenity, like attire or objects held.",
