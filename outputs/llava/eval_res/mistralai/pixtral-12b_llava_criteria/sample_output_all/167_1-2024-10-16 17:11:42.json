    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo find the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point, follow the arrow on the floor plan that points to the exit. This arrow is located in the lower portion of the image, and it indicates the direction you should head in to reach the nearest emergency exit. Keep in mind that the arrow is pointing upwards, which suggests that you will need to move upwards on the floor to reach the exit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point (marked with a red star), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the \"You Are Here\" Point**: The red star is located near room 212.\n\n2. **Locate the Nearest Emergency Exit**: Emergency exits are indicated by green \"EXIT\" signs. There is one near room 211.\n\n3. **Determine the Route**:\n   - Start at the red star near room 212.\n   - Move towards the north, following the hallway past rooms 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217.\n   - Continue past the stairwell (227) and rooms 220, 219, and 218.\n   - Turn left at the end of the hallway towards the emergency exit sign.\n   - Follow the hallway to the emergency exit near room 211.\n\n4. **Follow the Evacuation Route**: The dashed green arrows indicate the evacuation route, which should be followed to ensure the quickest and safest path to the emergency exit.\n\nBy following this route, you will efficiently reach the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\nThe quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point is to move north past rooms 212-217, turn left at the end of the hallway, and follow the evacuation route to the emergency exit near room 211.\n```\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify the \"You Are Here\" point and the nearest emergency exit.\n2. Describe the path including turns and any landmarks (e.g., room numbers, staircases).\n3. Ensure the route is the quickest possible, avoiding detours or longer paths.",
