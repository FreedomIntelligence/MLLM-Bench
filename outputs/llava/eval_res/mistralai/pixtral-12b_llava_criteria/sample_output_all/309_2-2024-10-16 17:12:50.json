    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the container in the top left corner in the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, will people likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIf the container in the top left corner of the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, it is likely that people would be at risk of being scalded if they held the bottle. This is because most metal or insulated containers can hold high temperatures for an extended period, making them difficult to handle without protection.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Material Insulation**: Many insulated bottles and containers are designed to retain heat or cold very effectively. This means that the bottle may keep the boiling water at a high temperature for a considerable time.\n\n2. **Temperature Retention**: Boiling water at 100°C can cause severe burns if it comes into contact with skin. Even if the bottle itself doesn't feel extremely hot to the touch, the water inside could still be dangerously hot.\n\n3. **Handling**: Holding the bottle without any protective gear (like an oven mitt or a thick cloth) would likely result in burns or scalds.\n\n4. **Safety Features**: Some insulated bottles come with safety features like heat-resistant grips or warning labels, but these are not visible in the image. If such features are absent, it's best to assume the bottle could transmit heat.\n\nIn summary, if the bottle was filled with boiling water, it would be prudent to use caution and protective measures to avoid being scalded.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle containing boiling water at 100°C without using proper protective measures like oven mitts or a thick towel. The hot water can cause burns to their hands, especially if the bottle is made of a heat-conductive material, such as plastic. It is important to handle hot containers with care and use appropriate protective equipment to avoid accidents and injuries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference the insulated nature of the bottle and the unlikelihood of scalding.\n2. Include reasoning on the physical properties of insulation.",
