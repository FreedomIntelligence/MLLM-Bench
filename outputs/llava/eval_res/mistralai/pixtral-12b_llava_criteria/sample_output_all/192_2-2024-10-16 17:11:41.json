    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n### CT Report\n\n**Study Date:** [Insert Date]\n\n**Study Type:** Non-contrast CT Brain\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: [Patient's Name]\n- Age: [Patient's Age]\n- Sex: [Patient's Sex]\n\n**Clinical Indication:**\n[Insert clinical indication, e.g., Evaluation of headache, suspected intracranial pathology]\n\n**Technical Aspects:**\n- Modality: CT (Computed Tomography)\n- Series: Non-contrast\n- Slice thickness: [Insert slice thickness, e.g., 5 mm]\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. **Cerebral Hemispheres:**\n   - Symmetrical appearance of the cerebral hemispheres.\n   - No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect.\n\n2. **Ventricles:**\n   - Lateral ventricles are of normal size and symmetry.\n   - No evidence of hydrocephalus.\n\n3. **Basal Cisterns:**\n   - Basal cisterns are patent and appear normal.\n\n4. **Subarachnoid Spaces:**\n   - The subarachnoid spaces are well visualized and appear normal.\n\n5. **Brain Stem and Cerebellum:**\n   - Brain stem and cerebellum appear normal in size and morphology.\n\n6. **Skull and Sinuses:**\n   - No evidence of bony abnormalities or sinus pathology.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The non-contrast CT brain scan shows no acute abnormalities such as hemorrhage, infarction, or mass effect.\n- The ventricular system, basal cisterns, and subarachnoid spaces are normal.\n- No evidence of hydrocephalus, bony abnormalities, or sinus pathology.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Clinical correlation is recommended.\n- Further imaging or evaluation may be necessary based on clinical findings.\n\n**Reported By:**\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Institution]\n\n**Date of Report:** [Insert Date]\n\n**Please note:** This report is based on the provided image and does not include any clinical correlation or patient history beyond what is stated above. For a comprehensive assessment, clinical correlation with patient history and further imaging as indicated are essential.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
