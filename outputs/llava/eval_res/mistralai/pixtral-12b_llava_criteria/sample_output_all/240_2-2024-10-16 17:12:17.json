    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical characteristics that are typical for the species and breeds of the animals in the image, such as coat type and ear shape\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nCertainly! Let's break down the physical characteristics of each animal in the image:\n\n1. **Left Puppy (Jack Russell Terrier)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: The Jack Russell Terrier typically has a smooth, rough, or broken coat. In the image, the puppy has a smooth coat which is short and dense.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Jack Russell Terriers usually have erect ears that are small to medium in size. The puppy in the image has erect ears that are relatively small.\n\n2. **Middle Kitten (Maine Coon)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: Maine Coons are known for their long, thick, double coat which helps them withstand cold climates. The kitten in the image has a fluffy coat that is long and dense.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Maine Coons have large, pointed ears that often have tufts of fur inside. The kitten in the image has large ears that are pointed and appear to have some fur inside.\n\n3. **Right Puppy (Labrador Retriever)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: Labrador Retrievers have a short, dense, and water-resistant coat. The puppy in the image has a short coat that appears smooth and dense.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Labrador Retrievers have medium-sized ears that are typically set higher on the head. The puppy in the image has ears that are set moderately high and appear to be medium in size.\n\n### Summary of Comparisons:\n- **Coat Type**:\n  - Jack Russell Terrier: Short, dense, smooth coat.\n  - Maine Coon: Long, thick, double coat.\n  - Labrador Retriever: Short, dense, water-resistant coat.\n  \n- **Ear Shape**:\n  - Jack Russell Terrier: Small to medium, erect ears.\n  - Maine Coon: Large, pointed ears with tufts of fur inside.\n  - Labrador Retriever: Medium-sized ears set moderately high.\n\nThese characteristics are typical for the breeds shown and can be useful for identifying and understanding the needs of each animal.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features three puppies and a kitten, showcasing a mix of species and breeds. The puppies present in the image can be characterized by their furry coats and dog-like features, such as pointy ears and a muzzle. The cat, on the other hand, is characterized by its sleek, furry coat, large pointy ears, and, of course, a more elongated body. The ears of the dogs are pointed upwards, which is a typical characteristic of many dog breeds, whereas the cat has large, pointed ears, which is a more cat-like feature. By comparing these physical characteristics, one can appreciate the differences between the animals and their respective species and breeds.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare coat types: smooth white with tan patches, fluffy long-haired, soft short cream-colored.\n2. Compare ear shapes: partially folded, pointed and floppy.",
