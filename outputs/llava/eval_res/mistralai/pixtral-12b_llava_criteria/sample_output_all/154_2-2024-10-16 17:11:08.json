    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a formal event featuring elements of discipline and ceremony, likely a military or ceremonial guard parade. Here are some key aspects of discipline and ceremony visible in the image:\n\n1. **Uniformity and Appearance**: The participants are dressed in identical red uniforms with black bearskin hats, white gloves, and black boots, which emphasizes their unity and adherence to a strict standard of appearance.\n\n2. **Formation**: The guards are marching in a precise, organized formation. This indicates a high level of discipline and coordination, ensuring that each member knows their position and moves in synchrony with the others.\n\n3. **Marching Drill**: The guards are performing a marching drill, which involves precise movements and steps. This drill is a display of their training and discipline, requiring concentration and physical control.\n\n4. **Carrying Flags and Weapons**: Some of the guards are carrying flags and others are holding rifles. These actions require specific training and discipline to ensure the proper handling and presentation of these items during the ceremony.\n\n5. **Discipline in Movement**: The guards are marching with a consistent pace and rhythm, demonstrating their discipline and coordination. This is particularly evident in the uniformity of their stride and the timing of their steps.\n\n6. **Presence of a Leader**: There appears to be a leader at the front of the formation, likely giving commands or setting the pace. This figure is crucial for maintaining the discipline and order of the group.\n\n7. **Ceremonial Setting**: The event is taking place in front of a grand, historical building, suggesting a ceremonial or official context. The presence of a crowd watching the parade adds to the formal and ceremonial nature of the event.\n\nThese elements collectively highlight the discipline and ceremony involved in the event, showcasing the guards' training, coordination, and adherence to tradition.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3. Mention the context suggesting a multicultural event.",
