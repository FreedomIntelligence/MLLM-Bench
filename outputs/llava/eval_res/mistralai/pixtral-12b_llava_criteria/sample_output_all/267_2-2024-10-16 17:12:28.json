    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat factors could have contributed to the people's fall on the ice surface?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere are several factors that could have contributed to the person's fall on the ice surface in the image. Some of these factors include:\n\n1. The ice surface may be slippery, making it difficult to maintain balance and footing, especially if the person is wearing shoes or boots that do not provide adequate traction on ice.\n2. The person might be moving too quickly or making sudden movements, which can cause them to lose their balance and fall.\n3. The ice may be uneven or have hidden patches of thinner ice, which could cause a person to trip or fall unexpectedly.\n4. The person's clothing or footwear may not be suitable for the cold and slippery conditions, increasing the risk of slipping and falling.\n5. The person might be inexperienced in walking or moving on ice, which can increase the likelihood of falling.\n\nTo minimize the risk of falling on ice, it is important to wear appropriate footwear with good traction, move slowly and carefully, and be aware of the ice conditions and any potential hazards in the area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSeveral factors could have contributed to the people's fall on the ice surface. First, the icy road can be slippery, which can cause the individuals to lose their footing and balance. Second, the presence of snow on the ground might indicate cold weather conditions, which could have reduced the friction between the road and the shoes, making it difficult for the people to maintain their balance. Additionally, the people might not have proper footwear for these conditions or might have misjudged the extent of the icy and slippery surface. Finally, the presence of a bicycle in the image also indicates that it could have been involved in the fall or that the person lost control while cycling on ice, leading to the fall.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Include 'slippery ground' as a factor contributing to the fall.\n2. Mention that the sliperry shoes can also be a factor.",
