    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 675*900, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,900) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (675,0), where approximately would you place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\"?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo determine the approximate coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3,\" we need to visually assess the image and estimate the position of the sign relative to the origin (0,0) and the dimensions provided.\n\nGiven the dimensions:\n- The width of the image is 675 units.\n- The height of the image is 900 units.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the sign for \"Lemons 6 for $3\" is located towards the top right corner of the fruit display. Based on the visual placement, we can estimate the coordinates of the sign.\n\n1. The sign is located near the top edge of the image.\n2. The sign is also towards the right side of the image.\n\nTo approximate:\n- The y-coordinate (vertical position) is close to the top, so it will be close to 900.\n- The x-coordinate (horizontal position) is towards the right, so it will be closer to 675.\n\nConsidering the exact placement visually, we can estimate:\n- The y-coordinate is around 850 to 870.\n- The x-coordinate is around 620 to 640.\n\nThus, the approximate coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are around (630, 860).\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in the image, we can consider the middle-left portion of the image, which is approximately at 0.15, 0.23. This placement would make the sign visible and accessible to the customers. The coordinates for this placement would be (0.25, 0.16, 0.45, 0.36), with the sign being slightly to the left of the center of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Coordinates should approximate (450,600) for the \"Lemons 6 for $3\" sign.",
