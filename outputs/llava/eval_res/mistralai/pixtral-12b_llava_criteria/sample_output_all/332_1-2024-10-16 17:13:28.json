    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess vehicles' damage in the image, and rank them in order of damage severity\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several vehicles that have sustained damage during the accident. They are:\n\n1. A car in the middle of the scene, which has almost been T-boned and appears to be significantly damaged.\n2. Two cars in the foreground, which seem to have been involved in the collision. One car has a broken windshield and the other seems to be significantly damaged as well.\n3. A car near the right side of the scene, which has sustained some damage.\n4. A car at the far right side of the scene, which appears to be relatively undamaged compared to the other cars involved in the accident.\n\nIt is important to note that there might be other cars in the scene that have sustained damage, but they are not as visible or identifiable as the above vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo assess the damage severity of the vehicles in the image, we will look at the visible signs of damage, such as dents, broken glass, and other noticeable issues. Here's a ranking of the vehicles from most to least damaged:\n\n1. **Red Car (being towed by the red tow truck)**: This car appears to have significant front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and broken headlights. The extent of the damage suggests it has been involved in a major collision.\n\n2. **Silver Car (near the center of the image)**: This car has noticeable damage to its front bumper and hood. The extent of the damage is visible, indicating it was likely in a moderate to severe collision.\n\n3. **White Car (next to the silver car)**: This car has damage to its front bumper and possibly its grille. The damage is less extensive than the silver car but still indicates a collision.\n\n4. **Other cars around the scene**: These vehicles have minor damage, such as small dents or scratches, indicating they may have been involved in minor fender benders or were affected by the larger accident.\n\nIn summary, the red car being towed is the most severely damaged, followed by the silver and white cars, with the other vehicles around the scene having minor damage.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if red vehicle has severe head section damage, silver vehicle has visible rear damage.\n2. Rank vehicles' damage severity correctly as answer: red vehicle (severe damage to its head section) > silver vehicle (visible rear damage).\n3. Evaluate damage without identifying or making statements about people.",
