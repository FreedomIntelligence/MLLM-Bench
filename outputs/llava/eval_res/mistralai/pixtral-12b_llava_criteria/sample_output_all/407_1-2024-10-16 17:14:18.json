    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the foods on the table detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe table features a plate full of food, which includes meat, bread, greens, and a salad. There are several pieces of bread, some of which are of different sizes. A bowl of sauce is also present on the table. Additionally, there's a donut on the table, slightly separated from the main plate of food.\n\nIn the background, a stuffed teddy bear is sitting next to the plate. The dining table occupies most of the scene, setting a casual atmosphere for enjoying the meal.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays a variety of foods arranged on a plate placed on a wooden table.

They are light in color and appear to be plain.\n\n4. **Vegetables**: There is a small serving of dark green vegetables, possibly spinach or a similar leafy green, placed under the grilled chicken. They are garnished with a sprig of parsley.\n\n5. **Dips**: \n   - **Yellow Sauce**: In a small bowl towards the bottom right of the plate, there is a yellow sauce, possibly a cheese or mustard-based dip.\n   - **Red Sauce**: In another small bowl, there is a red, textured sauce, which could be a spicy chili or pepper flake-based condiment.\n\n6. **Decorative Item**: To the left of the plate, there is a small, round, decorative item resembling a cartoon character made of clay or plastic. It has a light color with orange accents.\n\nThe arrangement and variety suggest a meal meant to be shared, with different flavors and textures to enjoy.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
