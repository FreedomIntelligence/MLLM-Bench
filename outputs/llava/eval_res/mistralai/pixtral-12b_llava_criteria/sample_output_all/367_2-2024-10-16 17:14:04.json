    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf one of the person in the image wants to post this picture on social media, please help write an small article which narrates the entire scene from his/her perspective and include their sensory experiences - what they see, hear, smell, and feel - as well as their inner thoughts and emotions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n### A Sunset to Remember\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, I knew this was going to be a moment to cherish. The beach was bathed in a warm, golden light that seemed to whisper promises of tranquility and unity. The sandy shore beneath our feet was cool and damp, a stark contrast to the fiery sky above. The gentle lapping of the waves against the shore was a soothing symphony, a rhythm that has always held a special place in my heart.\n\nWe gathered as a large family, our hands entwined, creating a human chain that stretched from one end of the beach to the other. The laughter and chatter that filled the air were like the sweetest melodies, each voice blending in perfect harmony. The kids were especially excited, their eyes wide with wonder as they watched the sun paint the sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple.\n\nThe scent of the ocean was crisp and salty, carrying with it memories of countless summers spent together. It was a smell that grounded me, reminding me of the simple joys of life. The breeze was soft, carrying with it the promise of change and renewal. It rustled through our hair and clothes, a gentle caress that seemed to whisper secrets only we could hear.\n\nAs I looked around at the smiling faces of my loved ones, I felt a profound sense of gratitude. Each person standing there was a part of our family's tapestry, their presence adding color and depth to our lives. The love that bound us together was palpable, a tangible force that made this moment even more precious.\n\nThe sunset itself was breathtaking. The sky was a canvas of beauty, with the sun dipping below the horizon in a blaze of glory. The clouds were like wisps of cotton candy, their edges tinged with gold and pink. It was a sight that took my breath away, a reminder of the incredible beauty that nature can offer.\n\nThis image captures more than just a moment in time; it encapsulates the essence of our family. It is a testament to the love, laughter, and unity that we share. As I look at this picture, I am filled with a sense of peace and joy, grateful for the memories we've made and the adventures yet to come.\n\n--- \n\n*Written with love and gratitude by [Your Name]*\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs I stand on the beach with my family and friends, our hands entwined in a chain, I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and happiness. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the waves, and the sky is adorned with clouds that add to the picturesque scene. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the gentle sea breeze create a calming atmosphere. The smell of the saltwater and the cool sand beneath my feet remind me of the carefree days of childhood spent on the beach.\n\nAs I look at the people around me - our family and friends, young and old, I feel a sense of togetherness and gratitude. This moment captured, with the backdrop of a beautiful sunset, is a memory that will be cherished for years to come. It is a reminder of the importance of spending quality time with loved ones, enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\n\nWith my cellphone in hand, I snap a photo to capture this precious memory. The image not only shows the chain of people on the beach but also the vibrant colors of the sunset and the ocean waves. I share it on social media, along with a caption that expresses my emotions and thoughts about this beautiful moment.
