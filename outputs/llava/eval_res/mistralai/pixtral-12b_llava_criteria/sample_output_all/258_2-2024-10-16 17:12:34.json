    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the upper side and lower side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSure! Here are five differences between the upper and lower images:\n\n1. **Glasses**: In the upper image, the person on the far left (wearing a yellow hat) is not wearing glasses. In the lower image, the same person is wearing glasses.\n\n2. **Laptop Position**: In the upper image, the person on the far right (wearing a green shirt) is holding the laptop with both hands. In the lower image, the person is holding the laptop with one hand.\n\n3. **Drink in Hand**: In the upper image, the person sitting on the left side of the table (wearing a yellow shirt) is holding a drink. In the lower image, the same person is not holding a drink.\n\n4. **Hair Style**: In the upper image, the person on the right side of the table (wearing a green shirt) has spiky hair. In the lower image, the same person has a different hairstyle, which is smoother.\n\n5. **Expression**: In the upper image, the person in the middle of the table (wearing an orange shirt) has a neutral expression. In the lower image, the same person appears to be smiling.\n\nThese differences highlight some subtle changes in the cartoon illustration between the two images.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the upper side of the image, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones, whereas in the lower side, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones. However, the differences between the two images include the poses of the people and the layout of the table. The people in the upper image are in different poses and are not all in the same positions as in the lower image. There is also a bottle visible in both images, but its placement on the table is different. Additionally, the presence of a dining table and chairs is common to both images, but the design or style of the table and chairs may differ.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in logo direction, object colors in hand, right foot direction, hair style, and chair legs.",
