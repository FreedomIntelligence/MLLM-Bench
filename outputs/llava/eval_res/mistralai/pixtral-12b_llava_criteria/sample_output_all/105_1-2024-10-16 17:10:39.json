    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the rightmost person who only shows an arm and a leg holding in his right hand?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe rightmost person who only shows an arm and a leg is holding a cell phone in his right hand.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows three people sitting together on a bench. The person on the right is only partially visible, with one leg and one arm showing. They are holding what appears to be a smartphone in their right hand.\n\nTo determine what they are holding, we need to observe the object closely. The object in their hand is rectangular and has a screen, which is characteristic of a smartphone. Additionally, the way they are holding it suggests they are interacting with the device, which further supports the idea that it is a smartphone.\n\nTherefore, the rightmost person is holding a smartphone in their right hand.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify object in rightmost person's right hand as a digital device with a display screen.",
