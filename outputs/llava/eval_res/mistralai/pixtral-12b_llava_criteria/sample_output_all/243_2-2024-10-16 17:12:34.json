    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the visual design elements of the monsters, such as texture, coloration, and body structure.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe visual design elements of the monsters in the image highlight significant differences in their textures, coloration, and body structures.\n\n1. **Texture**:\n   - **Godzilla**: Godzilla has a rough, scaly texture with pronounced spikes running down its back. This gives it a rugged and fearsome appearance.\n   - **King Kong**: King Kong has a more furry texture, resembling that of a large ape. His body appears smoother and more muscular compared to Godzilla.\n\n2. **Coloration**:\n   - **Godzilla**: Godzilla is depicted in darker, earthy tones, primarily shades of brown and gray, which emphasize its fearsome and ancient nature.\n   - **King Kong**: King Kong has a more varied coloration, often shown in darker shades of gray or brown, but with lighter fur on his chest and face, giving him a more primal and animalistic look.\n\n3. **Body Structure**:\n   - **Godzilla**: Godzilla has a more streamlined, reptilian body structure with a long tail, powerful legs, and a large, spiked back. Its design suggests strength and speed.\n   - **King Kong**: King Kong has a more humanoid body structure with broad shoulders, long arms, and a shorter tail. His design emphasizes his ape-like features and agility.\n\nThese differences in texture, coloration, and body structure help to distinguish the two monsters and emphasize their unique characteristics and roles in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, both monsters have a menacing appearance, with a combination of rough texture and bold colors. They are closely facing each other, emphasizing the visual impact of their respective features. The first monster, located on the left, has a large, spiky, and clawed body structure, with a dark, almost gray-blue hue. On the other hand, the second monster is more towards the right and has a noticeably different appearance. This monster has a more prominent spiky head and is colored a mix of dark gray, black, and a few orange or red tones, giving it a more intimidating appearance. Although the two monsters have different body structures and colors, their overall visual design elements contribute to the action and intensity of the scene, making it an exciting and eye-catching image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare textures of Godzilla and King Kong.\n2. Describe and contrast the coloration of both monsters.\n3. Compare the body structures, focusing on distinguishing features.",
