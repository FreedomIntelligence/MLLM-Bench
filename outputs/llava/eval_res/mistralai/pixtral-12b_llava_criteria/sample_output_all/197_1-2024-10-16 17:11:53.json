    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a small, shallow wound on the skin surface, likely caused by a minor cut or scrape. The wound appears to be relatively fresh, as there is no significant scabbing or signs of healing.\n\n### Advice:\n1. **Clean the Wound**: Wash the area gently with soap and warm water to remove any dirt or bacteria. Use clean hands or a sterile cloth to avoid introducing new contaminants.\n\n2. **Apply Antiseptic**: Use an antiseptic solution such as hydrogen peroxide or an alcohol-based cleaner to further reduce the risk of infection.\n\n3. **Cover the Wound**: Apply a sterile bandage or gauze pad over the wound to protect it from further contamination and promote healing.\n\n4. **Keep it Dry**: Change the bandage daily, and keep the wound dry to prevent it from becoming infected.\n\n5. **Monitor for Infection**: Watch for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or pus. If any of these symptoms appear, seek medical attention.\n\n6. **Pain Management**: If the wound is painful, you can use an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Avoid using aspirin, which can thin the blood and increase bleeding.\n\n7. **Avoid Picking**: Do not pick at the scab or wound, as this can lead to further damage and scarring.\n\nIf the wound does not improve or if it worsens, or if you experience severe pain or other concerning symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
