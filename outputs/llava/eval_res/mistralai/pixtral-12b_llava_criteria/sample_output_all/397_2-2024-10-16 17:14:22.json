Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression, we need to follow a few steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data points**: We need the values of capital expenditure (depreciation and amortization) for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n2. **Calculate the average values**: Find the average year for the x-axis (years) and the average value for the y-axis (depreciation and amortization).\n3. **Determine the slope and intercept**: Use the formula for the line of best fit \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept.\n4. **Predict the value for 2023**: Use the formula with the year 2023 to predict the depreciation and amortization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data points**:\n   - 2020: \\( x = 2020, y = 651,523 \\)\n   - 2021: \\( x = 2021, y = 1,495,380 \\)\n   - 2022: \\( x = 2022, y = 2,224,169 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the average values**:\n   - Average \\( x \\) (year): \\( \\frac{2020 + 2021 + 2022}{3} = \\frac{6063}{3} = 2021 \\)\n   - Average \\( y \\) (depreciation and amortization): \\( \\frac{651,523 + 1,495,380 + 2,224,169}{3} \\approx 1,503,975 \\)\n\n3. **Determine the slope and intercept**:\n   - Slope \\( m \\): \\( m = \\frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} \\)\n     - For 2020 and 2021: \\( m = \\frac{1,495,380 - 651,523}{2021 - 2020} = \\frac{843,857}{1} = 843,857 \\)\n     - For 2021 and 2022: \\( m = \\frac{2,224,169 - 1,495,380}{2022 - 2021} = \\frac{728,789}{1} = 728,789 \\)\n     - Average slope: \\( m = \\frac{843,857 + 728,789}{2} \\approx 786,323 \\)\n\n   - Y-intercept \\( b \\): \\( b = y - mx \\)\n     - For 2020: \\( b = 651,523 - 786,323 \\times 2020 = 651,523 - 1588,303,060 \\approx -1588,302,409 \\)\n\n4. **Predict the value for 2023**:\n   - Using the formula \\( y = mx + b \\):\n     - \\( y = 786,323 \\times 2023 - 1588,302,409 \\)\n     - \\( y = 1,604,676,179 - 1588,302,409 \\)\n     - \\( y = 17,565 \\)\n\nBased on this calculation, the predicted capital expenditure for 2023 is approximately 17,565.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted value should be based on \"depreciation and amortization\" figures from 2020 to 2022.\n2. Answer must include a specific numerical prediction for 2023 capital expenditure.\n3. Prediction should be derived using linear regression on the provided data points.",
