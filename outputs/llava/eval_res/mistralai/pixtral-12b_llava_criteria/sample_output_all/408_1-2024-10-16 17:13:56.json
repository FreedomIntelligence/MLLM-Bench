    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed caption that describes not just the visual elements of the image but also suggests the geographical setting and possible climatic conditions present in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a calm blue stream of water reflecting a majestic, snow-covered mountain peak. The scene appears to be set in a picturesque valley surrounded by tall trees and with a lush green field nearby. The presence of snow on the peak suggests colder climatic conditions at higher elevations. The tranquil atmosphere in the valley, the reflection of the mountain on the still water, and the stunning natural backdrop of the snowy peak create an idyllic and serene landscape.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image captures a breathtaking mountain landscape under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. Dominating the background is a majestic, snow-capped peak, its white slopes contrasting sharply with the rugged, dark brown and grey rock formations surrounding it. The mountain's reflection is mirrored perfectly in the calm, clear waters of a winding stream that meanders through a lush meadow in the foreground. The vegetation is sparse but vibrant, featuring patches of green grass and clusters of shrubs, suggesting a high-altitude environment typical of alpine regions. The overall scene indicates a cold, possibly sub-zero climate, with the presence of snow and the barren appearance of the mountainside, characteristic of areas like the Himalayas or the Rocky Mountains.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption identifies mountain, river, vegetation, and any man-made structures.\n2. Caption suggests geographical setting (e.g., mountain range, region).\n3. Caption infers climatic conditions (e.g., cold, temperate, alpine).",
