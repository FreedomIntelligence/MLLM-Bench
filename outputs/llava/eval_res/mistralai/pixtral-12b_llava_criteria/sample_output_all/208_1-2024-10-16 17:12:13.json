Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the person in the image wants to play higher notes, in which direction should the right hand move?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIf the person in the image wants to play higher notes on a piano, they should move their right hand upwards along the keyboard. The black piano keys are arranged in a specific pattern, and each key corresponds to a particular note on the music staff. By moving their hand upwards, the person can select and press a key that corresponds to a higher pitch, resulting in the corresponding note being played. The exact movement could be towards the right side of the keyboard, depending on the specific piano. To understand this, one should familiarize themselves with the piano keyboard layout and the relationship between the keys and the notes they represent.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe right hand should move to the right along the keyboard to play higher notes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
