    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nCertainly! Here are five differences between the two images:\n\n1. **Fish on the Fishing Rod**: In the right-hand side image, the fishing rod has a fish attached to it, while in the left-hand side image, there is no fish on the rod.\n\n2. **Penguin's Feet Color**: In the right-hand side image, the penguin's feet are yellow, whereas in the left-hand side image, the penguin's feet are orange.\n\n3. **Background Mountain Shape**: The shape of the mountain in the background differs slightly between the two images. The right-hand side image has a more defined peak compared to the left-hand side image.\n\n4. **Penguin's Beak Orientation**: The orientation of the penguin's beak is different in both images. In the right-hand side image, the beak is slightly more open, while in the left-hand side image, it appears more closed.\n\n5. **Color of the Water**: The color of the water in the background is slightly different. The right-hand side image has a lighter blue hue compared to the deeper blue in the left-hand side image.\n\nThese differences highlight the subtle changes between the two images.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are two images of a penguin sitting in the snow. The first image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and catching a fish, while the second image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and preparing to catch a fish. There are many fish in both pictures, but their positions are different. On the left, the fish are near the top-right side, and on the right, the fish are closer to the penguin. The penguin appears to be the same in both images, with no noticeable differences in its appearance. Overall, there are five differences in the image pairs, including the fish's positions, the fishing pole's orientation, and the fish's visibility.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences in penguin's left foot color, ice hole size, background iceberg, fishing line buoys, and penguin tail.",
