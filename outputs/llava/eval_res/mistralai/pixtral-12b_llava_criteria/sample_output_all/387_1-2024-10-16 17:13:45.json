    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo predict the trajectories of the vehicles and suggest safety measures, let's analyze the image closely:\n\n1. **Identify Current Positions and Motions**:\n   - The vehicles are on a wet road, likely due to rain, as evidenced by the water splashes.\n   - The car in the foreground (left side) is moving at a noticeable speed, creating a significant water splash.\n   - The car in the middle ground (right side) appears to be moving slower or possibly stationary.\n\n2. **Predict Trajectories**:\n   - The car in the foreground is likely to continue moving forward in a straight line or slight curve, depending on the road's direction.\n   - The car in the middle ground might remain stationary or start moving forward soon.\n\n3. **Safety Measures to Avoid Collision**:\n   - **Maintain Safe Distance**: The front car should maintain a safe distance from the car ahead to allow for reaction time in case the latter car suddenly starts moving.\n   - **Use Headlights**: Both cars should use their headlights to improve visibility in wet and dark conditions.\n   - **Reduce Speed**: Given the wet road conditions, both drivers should reduce their speed to avoid skidding or losing control.\n   - **Use Turn Signals**: If either car plans to change lanes or make a turn, they should use turn signals to communicate their intentions to other drivers.\n   - **Be Alert**: Drivers should stay alert and attentive to the movements of other vehicles, especially in challenging weather conditions.\n\nBy following these safety measures, drivers can minimize the risk of collisions on wet roads during nighttime.\nThe car in the foreground is likely to continue moving forward in a straight line or slight curve, while the car in the middle ground might remain stationary or start moving forward soon. To avoid collision, drivers should maintain a safe distance, use headlights, reduce speed, use turn signals, and stay alert.\n```\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
