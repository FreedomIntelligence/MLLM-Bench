    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe phone has a significant crack on the upper right corner of the screen, making it potentially unusable or hazardous to use without repair.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
