    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the competition information in the picture, such as stage of the game, team information, etc.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image details the following competition information:\n\n- **Event**: League of Legends Worlds 2023\n- **Stage**: Semifinals\n- **Match Type**: Best of 5\n- **Date**: November 12\n- **Time**: 4:00 PM PHT\n- **Teams**:\n  - JD Gaming (represented by their logo and name)\n  - T1 (represented by their logo and name)\n\nAdditional visual elements include the logos for \"The Grind\" and \"The Glory\" at the bottom of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays a trophy sitting next to a TV screen, which is showing the scoreboard during a game. There are two teams playing in the game, as indicated by the presence of two logos or team names.
