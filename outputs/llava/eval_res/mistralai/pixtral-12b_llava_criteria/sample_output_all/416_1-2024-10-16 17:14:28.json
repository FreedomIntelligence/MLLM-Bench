    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wooden piece is carved into an intricate flower pattern, and it features a star shape in the center, giving the impression of a sunburst. The carving creates a layered textured surface on the wood, adding depth and visual interest. The design is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, with the flower petals following a regular pattern, yet the varying sizes and shapes of the petals make the overall design feel unique and dynamic. The combination of the carved flower and the starburst center make this piece a striking piece of artistry and craftsmanship.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image showcases an intricate and elaborate wood carving that exudes a sense of depth and complexity. The central motif is a circular design, reminiscent of a mandala or a floral pattern, characterized by numerous concentric rings and radial lines. Each section within the rings features meticulously carved lines and geometric shapes, creating a textured surface that enhances the overall visual appeal.\n\nThe symmetry of the piece is striking, with a consistent pattern radiating outwards from the center. The radial symmetry is accentuated by the evenly spaced lines and shapes that extend from the central point to the outer edges. The craftsmanship highlights the natural grain of the wood, adding to the organic feel of the design.\n\nThe depth of the carving is notable, with layers of lines and shapes that create a three-dimensional effect. The interplay of light and shadow on the carved surface further emphasizes the depth and texture, making the piece appear almost sculptural. The outer frame, which is relatively simple, serves to highlight the intricate carving within, drawing the viewer's attention to the detailed patterns.\n\nOverall, the image captures a remarkable example of woodworking artistry, showcasing both the technical skill and the aesthetic sensibilities of the artist.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Describe the intricate patterns, including shapes and lines, and their arrangement.\n2. Mention the depth and texture of the carved wood, indicating 3D effect or flatness.\n3. Identify symmetrical or asymmetrical elements, noting repetition or variance.",
