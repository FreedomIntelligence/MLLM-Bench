    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict which watch characteristics will dominate in the next decade.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, which features a timeline of various tuna types, it is difficult to predict which watch characteristics will dominate the next decade. However, since the timeline represents different types of tuna and their developments, it is more likely to focus on the evolution of tuna species or their attributes, such as size, taste, and health benefits. Therefore, the expected trend would be to promote healthier and more sustainably sourced tuna options rather than focusing on watch features or characteristics that do not relate to the primary subject of the timeline.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the trends observed in the Seiko Tuna Timeline, the next decade is likely to see a continued emphasis on the following watch characteristics:\n\n1. **Durability and Robustness**: Seiko Tuna watches have traditionally been known for their robust and durable design. This trend is likely to continue, with a focus on materials that can withstand extreme conditions, such as titanium and hardlex crystal.\n\n2. **Luminosity**: The use of luminous materials like LumiBrite or LumiNova will likely remain a key feature, ensuring excellent readability in low-light conditions.\n\n3. **Dive Capabilities**: As these watches are often used for diving, water resistance will continue to be a crucial characteristic. Expect to see watches with enhanced water resistance features, possibly up to 1000m or more.\n\n4. **Unique Designs and Colors**: Seiko has been introducing unique designs and colors over the years, such as the Golden Tuna, Yellow Tuna, and Bluefin Tuna. This trend is likely to continue, with new and innovative color schemes and designs being introduced.\n\n5. **Spring Drive Technology**: The integration of Spring Drive technology, which combines the accuracy of a quartz watch with the traditional craftsmanship of a mechanical watch, will likely become more prevalent.\n\n6. **Automatic Winding**: As seen in the later models, automatic winding will continue to be a key feature, reducing the need for manual winding and improving the overall user experience.\n\n7. **High-Quality Finishes**: The use of high-quality finishes, such as zaratsu polishing and other advanced finishing techniques, will likely become more common, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the watches.\n\nThese characteristics have been dominant in recent years and are expected to shape the future of Seiko Tuna watches in the next decade.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify historical trends in watch features from the timeline.\n2. Predict future trends in materials, technology, or design elements.\n3. Answer must be plausible and reflect evolution from past to future.",
