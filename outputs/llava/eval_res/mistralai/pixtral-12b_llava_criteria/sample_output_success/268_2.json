    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be unusable due to significant damage caused by water exposure. There are visible water droplets and residue on the board, which can lead to several issues:\n\n1. **Short Circuits:** Water can cause short circuits by creating conductive paths between different points on the board, leading to malfunction or failure of the circuit.\n2. **Corrosion:** The presence of water can corrode the components and traces on the board, damaging the electrical connections and rendering the board non-functional.\n3. **Component Damage:** The components on the board, such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits, can be damaged by water, leading to their failure and making the board unusable.\n4. **Electromigration:** Water can also cause electromigration, where the movement of electrons can lead to the diffusion of metal ions, further damaging the circuit.\n\nOverall, the water damage depicted in the image is likely the primary reason for the circuit board's unusability.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
