    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the woman's emotional state by examining her gaze and the placement of her hand, considering the potential symbolism of the blurred lights in the background.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a black veil and looking to her left side with tearful eyes. The hand that she is holding out appears to be in front of her face, which might indicate that she is blocking her face from the viewer or trying to conceal her emotions. This, in combination with the background where the lights are blurred, creates a somewhat mysterious and potentially symbolic atmosphere. It might suggest the woman is going through an emotional experience or dealing with a challenging situation, and the blurred lights could represent the confusion or the complexity of her emotions at that moment. The woman's gaze and her hand's position also suggest vulnerability, and the blurred lights in the background contribute to a sense of introspection and reflection on her emotions and experiences.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo assess the woman's emotional state, let's break down the visual elements in the image:\n\n1. **Gaze**: The woman's gaze is directed slightly downward and to the side, which often indicates introspection, sadness, or contemplation. Her eyes appear to be moist, suggesting she might be close to tears.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Her hand is raised with the palm facing outward, which can symbolize a defensive posture or a gesture to stop or hold back something. This can indicate that she is trying to protect herself emotionally or from an external situation.\n\n3. **Blurred Lights**: The blurred lights in the background could symbolize the chaos or the external world that is affecting her. The colors (blue, orange, and white) might suggest a mix of emotional states or experiences, such as calmness (blue) and warmth or passion (orange).\n\nGiven these visual elements, the combination of her downward gaze, moist eyes, and defensive hand posture suggests that she might be experiencing sadness, vulnerability, or emotional pain. The blurred lights in the background add to the sense of chaos or emotional turmoil, reinforcing the idea that she is dealing with a challenging situation.\nThe woman appears to be in a state of sadness, vulnerability, or emotional pain, as suggested by her downward gaze, moist eyes, and defensive hand posture, with the blurred lights in the background symbolizing external chaos or turmoil.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's emotional state  as sadness, regret, or perhaps a sense of longing.",
