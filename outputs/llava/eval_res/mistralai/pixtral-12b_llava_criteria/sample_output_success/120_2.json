    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotional exchange occurring between the individuals by considering their hand gestures, facial expressions, and the proximity to one another.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo interpret the emotional exchange occurring between the individuals, let's break down the visual elements:\n\n1. **Hand Gestures**:\n   - The man on the left has his hand raised with the index finger pointing slightly upward, suggesting a gesture of emphasis or explanation.\n   - The woman on the right has both hands raised, with her index finger pointing directly at the man. This is a more assertive gesture, often used to draw attention or make a point.\n\n2. **Facial Expressions**:\n   - The man appears to be smiling, which indicates that he might be in a light-hearted or playful mood. However, his eyes are wide open and focused on the woman, suggesting attentiveness to her actions or words.\n   - The woman has her mouth open as if she is speaking or reacting strongly. Her eyebrows are furrowed, indicating intensity or emphasis in her expression.\n\n3. **Proximity**:\n   - Both individuals are standing close to each other, which can indicate a more personal or intimate conversation. Their close proximity may suggest familiarity or a strong emotional connection.\n\nGiven these observations, it can be inferred that the woman is making a point or expressing a strong opinion to the man. The man's attentive yet smiling expression suggests he is engaged and possibly responding in a light-hearted manner. The overall interaction appears to be dynamic and emotionally charged, potentially indicative of a playful argument or lively discussion.\nThe emotional exchange seems to involve the woman making a strong point or expressing a firm opinion to the man, while the man is attentively engaged and possibly responding in a light-hearted manner. The interaction appears dynamic and emotionally charged, suggesting a lively discussion or playful argument.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the man and the woman are facing each other, engaged in a heated exchange. The woman is pointing her finger at the man, which often signifies a direct, assertive, or even confrontational tone in their conversation. Meanwhile, the man is smiling, which may indicate that he is either enjoying the interaction, trying to diffuse the situation, or simply being playful. The close proximity of the individuals further emphasizes the intensity of their emotional exchange. Overall, the scene suggests a lively and potentially tension-filled conversation between the two people.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by both individuals' facial expressions and hand gestures as angry.\n2. Describe the nature of the emotional exchange based on proximity and body language.",
