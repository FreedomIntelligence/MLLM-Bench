    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease carefully examine the design of the bed and inform me of all its possible uses.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe design of the bed in the image appears to be a modern, low-profile platform bed with a large, cushioned headboard. This type of bed serves multiple purposes:\n\n1. **Sleeping Area**: The primary function of the bed is to provide a comfortable sleeping area. It appears to have a plush mattress, pillows, and bedding, ensuring restful sleep.\n\n2. **Seating Area**: The large cushioned headboard can serve as a comfortable backrest for sitting up in bed or for lounging against while reading or watching television.\n\n3. **Aesthetic Focal Point**: The bed's design contributes to the overall aesthetic of the room. Its clean lines and modern style complement the contemporary decor of the bedroom.\n\n4. **Additional Storage**: The low-profile design of the bed may allow for storage underneath, utilizing the space efficiently for items that are not frequently accessed.\n\n5. **Relaxation and Comfort**: With the inclusion of soft cushions and a cozy bedding arrangement, the bed is designed to provide a relaxing and comfortable environment for rest and rejuvenation.\n\nOverall, the bed's design combines functionality with style, making it a versatile piece for a modern bedroom.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bed in this image is an oddly shaped or square design made of wood and white. It features multiple pillows, giving it a cozy and comfortable appearance. Additionally, there are two benches in the room, one located near the foot of the bed and the other placed farther away. The room also contains other decorative elements, such as two vases situated on the floor.\n\nThis unique bed design, combined with the presence of benches, suggests that the room may serve multiple purposes other than just a bedroom. The benches can be used as seating for activities such as reading, watching television, or even as a place for guests to sit while conversing. The room could be a versatile space where guests can relax, socialize, or even work on a laptop or perform other tasks while enjoying the comfortable and inviting atmosphere created by the bed and benches.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify primary function of the bed (e.g., sleeping/resting) based on design.\n2. List additional functions (e.g., storage, seating) suggested by bed features.",
