    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo has been edited and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the photo has been edited to appear as though there are two cute little faux foxes playing on the side of the brick walkway. In reality, there is only one fox figure located in the grass near the wall. The second fox figure is an altered photo with the face of the fox added later to create the illusion of two foxes playing. This playful and creative editing gives the scene a whimsical and charming appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image appears to be a typical outdoor scene with a squirrel on a brick pathway, a road, and some buildings in the background. Here are some observations that might help determine if the photo has been edited:\n\n1. **Squirrel's Position**: The squirrel is positioned on the grass next to the brick pathway, which seems natural. However, its placement might be slightly unusual for someone familiar with the area, as squirrels often move quickly and might not pause in such a spot.\n\n2. **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting in the image is consistent, suggesting that the photo was taken at a similar time of day. The shadows cast by the squirrel and the objects around are uniform, which is typical of natural lighting conditions.\n\n3. **Background Consistency**: The buildings and vehicles in the background appear consistent with typical urban or suburban environments. There is no obvious discrepancy or anomaly that suggests manipulation.\n\n4. **Pathway and Road**: The brick pathway and road look clean and well-maintained. There are no visible seams or irregularities that would suggest photoshopped elements.\n\n5. **Color and Tone**: The colors and tones in the image are consistent, which is typical of unedited photos. There are no abrupt changes in color or brightness that would indicate editing.\n\n6. **Trash Can**: The trash can on the grass appears to be in its natural place, with no signs of tampering or editing.\n\nGiven these observations, it is likely that the image has not been edited. The scene appears natural and consistent with typical outdoor conditions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the photo is edited by identifying the added squirrel.\n2. Evaluate the explanation of how the squirrel's integration indicates editing.\n3. Assess the consistency of lighting and shadows related to the squirrel.",
