    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image appears to be damaged, with the frame bent and the strings possibly broken. To repair it, follow these steps:\n\n### Materials Needed:\n1. New strings\n2. Stringing machine (if available)\n3. String clamps\n4. Stringing tool (for tightening strings)\n5. Scissors or string cutter\n6. Racket grip tape (if the grip is damaged)\n7. Racket frame straightener (if available)\n\n### Steps to Repair the Racquet:\n\n1. **Inspect the Damage:**\n   - Check the extent of the damage to the frame. If the frame is severely bent or cracked, it may not be repairable.\n   - Inspect the grip for wear and tear.\n\n2. **Straighten the Frame:**\n   - If the frame is bent, use a racket frame straightener or a similar tool to carefully straighten it. Be cautious not to apply too much force, as this could cause further damage.\n\n3. **Replace the Strings:**\n   - If the strings are broken or damaged, cut them off using scissors or a string cutter.\n   - If a stringing machine is available, use it to string the racquet. If not, you can manually string the racquet using string clamps and a stringing tool.\n   - Start with the main strings (horizontal strings) and then the cross strings (vertical strings). Follow a standard pattern for tennis racquet stringing.\n\n4. **Replace the Grip:**\n   - If the grip is worn out, use grip tape to replace it. Remove the old grip by peeling it off carefully. Clean the handle with a damp cloth to remove any residue.\n   - Wrap the new grip tape around the handle, ensuring it is tight and even. Trim any excess tape.\n\n5. **Final Touches:**\n   - Once the strings and grip are in place, test the tension to ensure it is comfortable and suitable for playing.\n   - Trim any excess string ends neatly.\n\n### Tips:\n- If the damage is severe, consider taking the racquet to a professional racquet technician for repair.\n- Regular maintenance, such as replacing strings every few months, can help extend the life of your racquet.\n\nBy following these steps, you can repair your damaged racquet and continue playing with it.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
