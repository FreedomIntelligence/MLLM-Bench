Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows an opposition table of group B, what is the session number (e.g. 甲XT66) for the match between B1 and B3.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe session number for the match between B1 and B3 is 甲XT66.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe opposition table in the image shows the match schedules for group B. To find the session number for the match between B1 and B3, we need to locate their respective positions on the table and identify the session number listed at their intersection.\n\n1. Identify the row for B1: B1 is in the first column of the top row.\n2. Identify the column for B3: B3 is in the third column of the top row.\n3. Find the intersection of the row for B1 and the column for B3.\n4. The session number at this intersection is \"B2L\".\n\nThus, the session number for the match between B1 and B3 is **B2L**.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the session number for the match between B1 and B3 as 甲XT34.",
