    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo improve the quality of the image, you can try the following techniques:\n\n1. Increase the brightness: The image appears dark, so increasing the brightness can help to make the details more visible and improve the overall clarity of the scene.\n\n2. Adjust the contrast: Enhancing the contrast can make the different elements in the image stand out more distinctly, which can improve the visual appeal and make the image easier to interpret.\n\n3. Sharpen the image: Applying a sharpening filter can help to make the edges and details in the image more defined, resulting in a clearer and more crisp appearance.\n\n4. Reduce noise: The image has a grainy texture, which can be reduced using noise reduction techniques to make the image smoother and more visually appealing.\n\n5. Enhance colors: If the colors in the image seem dull or washed out, enhancing them can bring out the vibrancy and make the scene more engaging.\n\n6. Use image stabilization: If the image was taken with a camera or smartphone, using image stabilization techniques can help to minimize any blurriness caused by camera shake or motion.\n\n7. Use software for advanced editing: Utilizing advanced image editing software can provide a wide range of tools and features to improve the quality of the image, such as adjusting exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
