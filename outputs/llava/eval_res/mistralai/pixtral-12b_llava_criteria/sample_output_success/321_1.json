    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich of the CT scan needs a redo?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, we can see three different CT scans of a human chest and abdomen. One of the CT scans needs to be redone, as it is not as clear or detailed as the other two scans. To provide accurate information and diagnosis, it is important to have clear and well-defined images, and the CT scan that needs to be redone might not provide the necessary information. Therefore, a redo of that specific CT scan would be beneficial to improve the clarity and detail of the captured image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays four different CT scan images labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). The question asks which of these CT scans needs to be redone.\n\nHere are the key observations:\n1. Image (a): Appears to be a standard CT scan with clear visibility of the internal structures.\n2. Image (b): Also appears to be a standard CT scan, but with some areas that might be less clear.\n3. Image (c): Shows significant artifacts or blurring, affecting the clarity of internal structures.\n4. Image (d): Similar to image (c), with significant artifacts or blurring, making it difficult to discern internal structures.\n\nAnalyzing these observations:\n1. Image (a) and (b) appear to be of acceptable quality.\n2. Images (c) and (d) show artifacts or blurring, indicating poor image quality that could affect diagnostic accuracy.\n\nGiven that the images are of different quality, the ones with artifacts or blurring are the ones that need to be redone.\n\nTherefore, the CT scans that need to be redone are **images (c) and (d)**.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and confirm that CT scans (c) and (d) are the ones needing a redo.\n2. Assess clarity, noise, and artifacts affecting image quality in (c) and (d).",
