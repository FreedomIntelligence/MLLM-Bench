    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify any cultural or traditional attire and elements present in the scene, and infer the type of ceremony or event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are individuals dressed in traditional African attire, particularly a man wearing a kilt and a woman in a colorful dress. They are standing around a table, which indicates a formal event or ceremony. The presence of a cell phone on the table might suggest that the event is being documented or that the attendees are using it for communication. The group of people is engaged in a specific activity, and their attire suggests that the event is culturally or traditionally based.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts elements of a traditional African ceremony, particularly one associated with a West African culture. Here are the key observations and inferences:\n\n1. **Attire**:\n   - The man in the foreground is wearing a white traditional outfit with black detailing, which is common in many West African cultures for ceremonial purposes.\n   - The woman is dressed in a vibrant, colorful cloth that features intricate patterns, often seen in traditional West African attire. The cloth appears to be a wrapper or a wrap skirt, commonly known as \"ankara\" or \"kente\" in some regions.\n   - The man in the background is also dressed in white, which is typical for traditional ceremonies or weddings.\n\n2. **Accessories**:\n   - The woman is adorned with traditional jewelry, including a headpiece and possibly a necklace. These accessories are common in African weddings or formal ceremonies.\n   - The man on the left is holding a bouquet of flowers, which is often used in wedding ceremonies.\n\n3. **Setting**:\n   - The background is relatively plain, suggesting an indoor setting, possibly a home or a community center.\n   - The presence of an air conditioning unit on the wall indicates a modern setting.\n\n4. **Ceremony**:\n   - Based on the attire, accessories, and the presence of a bouquet, this scene likely depicts a traditional wedding ceremony.\n   - The exchange of items and the formal attire of the individuals suggest a significant and formal ritual being performed.\n\nBy analyzing these elements, it can be inferred that the scene is a traditional African wedding ceremony, possibly from a West African culture.\nThe scene depicts a traditional African wedding ceremony, likely from a West African culture, characterized by the attire, accessories, and setting observed in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
