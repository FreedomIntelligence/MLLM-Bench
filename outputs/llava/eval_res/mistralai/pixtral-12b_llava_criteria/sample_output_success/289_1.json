    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSpeculate on the age group of the man who is wearing a tie in the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the man wearing a tie appears to be older, possibly an elderly man. However, it is important to note that visual appearances can be deceiving, and without additional context, it is difficult to precisely determine his age group. Nonetheless, he is skateboarding down the street in a tie, which might suggest that he is likely an older individual who enjoys engaging in unconventional activities or is comfortable expressing his personality through his attire.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe man wearing a tie in the picture appears to be an older adult, likely in his 60s or 70s, given his appearance and the gray hair. This is in contrast to the younger individuals walking behind him, who seem to be teenagers or young adults, suggesting a significant age difference.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Infer the age group from visible age-related features such as white hair, receding hairline and wrinkles on the face. \n2. Estimate age group (youth, middle-aged, senior) without stereotyping activities.",
