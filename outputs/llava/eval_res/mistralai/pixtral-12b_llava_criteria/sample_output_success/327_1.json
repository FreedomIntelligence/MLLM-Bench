    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happens to the images from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the two images travel from left to right, the image loses contrast, giving it a silhouette appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFrom left to right in the image, the photos appear to show a comparison of the same scene under different lighting conditions or with different camera settings. The left image is brighter and more vivid, with the sun's rays clearly visible and creating a warm glow on the ground. The right image is darker and has less contrast, with the overall lighting reduced, possibly indicating a change in time of day, exposure settings, or editing adjustments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in exposure, contrast, and color balance between images.\n2. Assess sharpness, noise, and detail preservation in both images.\n3. Evaluate dynamic range, highlighting shadow and highlight detail retention.",
