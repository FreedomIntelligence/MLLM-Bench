    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo analyze the differences in species-specific features of the big cats illustrated in the image, we need to focus on each cat individually and compare their physical characteristics.\n\n1. **Top Left Cat (Tiger)**\n   - **Striped Coat:** Tigers have distinctive black or dark brown stripes on a lighter orange or yellowish-brown background.\n   - **Powerful Build:** Tigers have a muscular body with strong legs and a broad head.\n   - **Tail:** Tigers have a long tail with a thick black tip.\n\n2. **Top Right Cat (Lion)**\n   - **Mane:** Lions are easily recognizable by their mane, which is a thick ruff of hair around the neck and head. The mane can vary in color and thickness.\n   - **Body Color:** Lions usually have a tawny coat, though some can have darker or lighter fur.\n   - **Head Shape:** Lions have a broad head with a pronounced forehead and rounded ears.\n\n3. **Bottom Left Cat (Lioness)**\n   - **No Mane:** Unlike male lions, lionesses do not have a mane. They have a sleek head with short hair.\n   - **Smaller Size:** Lionesses are generally smaller and more slender than male lions.\n   - **Body Color:** Similar to male lions but often with a lighter coat.\n\n4. **Bottom Right Cat (Cheetah)**\n   - **Spotted Coat:** Cheetahs have a unique spotted coat, which helps them blend into their environment.\n   - **Lean Build:** Cheetahs have a slender, streamlined body designed for speed.\n   - **Tail:** Cheetahs have a long, thin tail with a white underside.\n   - **Ears:** Cheetahs have small, rounded ears.\n\nBy examining these features, we can distinguish between the different species of big cats present in the illustration.\nThe differences in species-specific features among the big cats in the image include:\n- **Tiger:** Striped coat, powerful build, long tail with a thick tip.\n- **Lion:** Mane, tawny coat, broad head.\n- **Lioness:** No mane, smaller size, tawny coat.\n- **Cheetah:** Spotted coat, lean build, long thin tail, small rounded ears.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
