    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas, we need to consider the following elements:\n\n1. **Bedroom Layout and Privacy:**\n   - The floor plan includes three bedrooms: a master bedroom and two additional bedrooms.\n   - The master bedroom is centrally located, and it has an attached bathroom.\n   - The other two bedrooms are on opposite sides of the floor plan. Each also has an attached bathroom.\n   - The master bedroom is adjacent to the kitchen, dining area, and living room, which are central communal areas.\n\n2. **Accessibility to Communal Areas:**\n   - The communal areas (kitchen, dining, living room) are centrally located.\n   - The kitchen is accessible from all parts of the floor plan, making it convenient for preparing and serving meals.\n   - The dining area is adjacent to the kitchen, promoting easy access for meals.\n   - The living room is centrally located, making it a focal point for socializing and relaxation.\n   - The prayer room is also centrally located, indicating it is easily accessible from all rooms.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - **Privacy:** Each bedroom has its own bathroom, ensuring privacy and convenience. The master bedroom is more centrally located, which can be advantageous for easy access to communal areas but may be less private due to its proximity to the communal spaces. The other two bedrooms are positioned at the edges of the floor plan, providing more privacy.\n   - **Accessibility:** The communal areas are centrally located, making them easily accessible from all parts of the house. This centralization promotes social interaction and convenience. The master bedroom's central location further enhances its accessibility to the communal areas.\n\nOverall, the floor plan balances privacy and accessibility effectively. While the master bedroom is more centrally located and accessible to communal areas, the other bedrooms offer more privacy. The communal areas are centrally situated, ensuring easy access and promoting social interaction.\nThe floor plan balances privacy and accessibility effectively. The master bedroom is centrally located, providing easy access to communal areas but potentially less privacy. The other bedrooms offer more privacy, each with its own bathroom. The communal areas are centrally situated, ensuring easy access and promoting social interaction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
