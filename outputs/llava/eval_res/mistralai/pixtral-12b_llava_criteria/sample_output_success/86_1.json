    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the scenery in the image in detail, where is this image been shot, what time does this image is been shot, and other information that could be helpful for others to recognize this image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a picturesque night scene dominated by a tall building in the midst of a forest. The building is situated atop a hill, and the sky above it is filled with a starry night display. The scene looks like it's located in a mountainous area, with trees surrounding the building and the star-filled sky serving as a backdrop. The nighttime setting is enhanced by the presence of several bright stars that create a mesmerizing atmosphere.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image captures a stunning nighttime scene featuring a traditional pagoda perched atop a hill, surrounded by lush greenery and a vast expanse of mountains. The sky is filled with star trails, indicating that the photograph was taken over an extended period, likely several minutes to an hour. The bright circular pattern suggests the camera was pointed towards the celestial pole, possibly Polaris (the North Star), which is stationary while other stars appear to revolve around it due to Earth's rotation. The overall ambiance suggests this image was shot during nighttime, possibly in a rural or mountainous area known for clear skies and minimal light pollution. Recognizing the specific location from the image alone is challenging, but the architectural style of the pagoda and the surrounding landscape might suggest East Asia, possibly China or Japan.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the scenery elements: star trails, pagoda, trees, and mountains.\n2. Determine and state the likely time of day: night, with reference to star trails.\n3. Provide contextual clues for location recognition without specifying the exact place.",
