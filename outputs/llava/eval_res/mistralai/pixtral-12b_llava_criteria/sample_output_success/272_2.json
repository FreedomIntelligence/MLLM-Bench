    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a professional setting where two individuals are shaking hands, likely indicating a formal agreement or successful negotiation. \n\n**Analysis of the Potential Relationship:**\n\n1. **Context and Setting:**\n   - The setting appears to be a business meeting or professional discussion, indicated by the presence of a conference table, documents, and laptops.\n   - The decor and ambiance suggest a formal or corporate environment, possibly an office or meeting room.\n\n2. **Participants:**\n   - One individual is seated, dressed in business attire (a suit), which suggests a higher position or a more formal role within the organization.\n   - The other individual, who is standing and shaking hands, is also dressed in business attire, indicating a professional relationship.\n\n3. **Body Language:**\n   - The seated individual is smiling and extending their hand, which conveys friendliness, confidence, and a positive attitude.\n   - The standing individual is also smiling and reciprocating the handshake, indicating mutual respect and agreement.\n\n4. **Documents and Items on the Table:**\n   - There are documents, a laptop, and a glass of water on the table, which suggests that they have been discussing or finalizing a business deal, contract, or project.\n\n5. **Additional Insight:**\n   - The presence of a female observer suggests that the meeting might involve multiple stakeholders or that she is part of the decision-making process.\n   - The observer is attentive and engaged, indicating her involvement in the discussion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the visual cues and context, the two individuals engaged in the handshake are likely business associates or colleagues finalizing a deal or agreement. The handshake symbolizes mutual respect, a successful negotiation, or the establishment of a professional relationship. The observer's presence indicates that this is a collaborative effort involving multiple parties.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
