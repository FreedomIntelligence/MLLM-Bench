    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19. The presence of two lines on the test kit indicates a positive result for the virus. Here is a detailed interpretation:\n\n1. **Test Kit Information**:\n   - The label on the test kit reads \"COVID-19 Ag,\" which stands for COVID-19 Antigen test.\n   - \"Dr.\" likely refers to the doctor or healthcare professional who directed or interpreted the test.\n   - The kit includes a control line (C) and a test line (T).\n   - The letter \"S\" may refer to the sample well where the nasal or throat swab sample is applied.\n\n2. **Interpretation of Lines**:\n   - **Control Line (C)**: This line always appears if the test is conducted properly. It indicates that the test is working correctly.\n   - **Test Line (T)**: This line appears when the antigen of the COVID-19 virus is detected in the sample. \n   - **Presence of Two Lines**: The presence of both the control line and the test line indicates a positive result for COVID-19. This means that the virus antigen was found in the sample.\n\nIf only the control line appears, it indicates a negative result (no virus antigen detected). If no lines appear, it suggests an invalid test, and the test may need to be repeated.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
