    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo properly open a new book as detailed in the image, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Place the book with its back on a table**: Start by positioning the book on a flat surface with the spine facing upwards.\n\n2. **Let the front cover down**: Gently lower the front cover of the book onto the table.\n\n3. **Then the back cover**: Next, lower the back cover onto the table.\n\n4. **Then open a few leaves in front**: Open a few pages at the front of the book.\n\n5. **Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached**: Open a few pages at the back of the book, alternating with the front pages, and press them down gently to reach the center of the book.\n\n6. **Do this two or three times in order to limber up the binding**: Repeat this process two or three times to loosen the binding of the book.\n\nThe instructions are clear and detailed, providing a step-by-step guide with visual aids to help understand the process. Each step is logically sequenced, making it easy to follow. The emphasis on gentle treatment and avoiding force is also crucial for preventing damage to the book.\n\nTo evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions:\n- **Clarity**: The instructions are presented in a straightforward manner with accompanying illustrations that visually depict each step. The language is simple and easy to understand.\n- **Effectiveness**: The steps are designed to loosen the binding gradually and gently, which is essential for preventing damage to the book. By following these steps, one can effectively open a new book without causing harm to its binding or pages.\n\nOverall, the instructions are both clear and effective in guiding the reader on how to properly open a new book.\nThe instructions provided in the image are clear and effectively guide the reader on how to properly open a new book, ensuring gentle treatment and preventing potential damage to the book’s binding.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
