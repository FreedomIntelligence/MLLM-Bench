    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows Earth with a predominantly blue and white appearance, indicating extensive cloud cover and large bodies of water, suggesting a thick atmosphere with abundant water vapor and a moderate climate. In contrast, Mars appears reddish-brown with minimal cloud cover, indicating a thin atmosphere with very little water vapor and a much colder climate. Earth's surface features include large oceans and extensive cloud patterns, while Mars shows signs of dry, dusty terrain with fewer atmospheric disturbances.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
