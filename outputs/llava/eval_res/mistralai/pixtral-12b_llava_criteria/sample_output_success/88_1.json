    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the device in the picture and describe the functionality and usage of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a device known as an electric screwdriver, which is being used to drill into metal. Electric screwdrivers are typically used in a wide range of professional settings for applications such as screwing or drilling in metal or similar materials. They offer a more convenient and efficient alternative to traditional manual tools, as they can deliver consistent and precise torque with a button press. The electric screwdriver can be especially useful for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as drilling screws into sheet metal, assembly, and disassembly tasks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe images show a device that appears to be a large, industrial glass cutting table. \n\n**Functionality and Usage:**\n1. **Glass Cutting Table:** This device is used to cut large sheets of glass to specific sizes and shapes. It is commonly used in the glass manufacturing and processing industry.\n2. **Precision Cutting:** The table features a cutting head that moves along the length of the glass sheet, guided by a precision system. This allows for accurate and straight cuts.\n3. **Safety Features:** The area around the cutting table is typically equipped with safety features such as barriers and warning lines to ensure the safety of workers operating the machine.\n4. **Versatility:** These tables can be used to cut different types of glass, including tempered glass, laminated glass, and even some types of acrylic sheets.\n5. **Automation:** Modern glass cutting tables often incorporate advanced automation and computer-controlled systems, which allow for programmed cuts and increased efficiency.\n\nIn the images, the glass cutting table is situated in an industrial setting, with various tools and materials around it, indicating that it is part of a larger glass processing facility. The presence of cables on the floor suggests that the table is connected to power sources and possibly to a computer system for precise control over the cutting process.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the device as a linear rail system.\n2. Describe the linear rail system's functionality accurately.\n3. Explain the usage of the linear rail system in context.",
