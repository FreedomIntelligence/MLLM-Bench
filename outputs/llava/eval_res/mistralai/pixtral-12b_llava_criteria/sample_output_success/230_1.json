    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nList all models that have pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere is no direct information provided in the image about the specific models with pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese. However, the image states that \"German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Italian, and Portuguese\" are among the languages supported by the models. This suggests that the models likely have pre-training support for a mix of languages, but the image does not provide a detailed list of which languages have such support.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine which models have pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese, we need to examine the table and identify the models that have a heart symbol (♥) in both the Spanish and Chinese columns.\n\nHere’s the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Review the table titled \"Table 2: The main language support of open-source models.\"\n2. Identify the models that have pre-training support for Spanish by looking for a heart symbol (♥) in the Spanish column.\n3. Identify the models that have pre-training support for Chinese by looking for a heart symbol (♥) in the Chinese column.\n4. List the models that have a heart symbol (♥) in both the Spanish and Chinese columns.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Dolly:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Alpaca:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Koala:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Baize:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Vicuna:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- LuoTuo:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Guanaco:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- BELLE:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Phoenix:  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n- Latin Phoenix (Chimera):  (Spanish),  (Chinese)\n\nThus, the models that have pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese are:\n\n- Dolly\n- Alpaca\n- Koala\n- Baize\n- Vicuna\n- LuoTuo\n- Guanaco\n- BELLE\n- Phoenix\n- Latin Phoenix (Chimera)\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List must include BELLE and Phoenix as they include both Spanish and Chinese during pre-training.",
