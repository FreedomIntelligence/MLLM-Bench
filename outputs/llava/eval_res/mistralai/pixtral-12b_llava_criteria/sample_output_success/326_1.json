    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat advice do you offer to the photographer of the image to improve image quality?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo improve image quality, the photographer should consider using a slower shutter speed and adjusting the aperture for a better depth of field. Since the image is described as a blur, it indicates that the shutter speed might have been too fast, causing motion blur in the crowd of people.\n\nBy decreasing the shutter speed, the photographer can capture more details within the scene, especially in fast-moving subjects like the woman walking. Additionally, adjusting the aperture can help in achieving a sharper image by allowing more light to enter the camera and allowing for a larger depth of field. This would result in a more balanced exposure, with both the foreground and background being more in focus.\n\nTo ensure they have these settings right, the photographer can also use a tripod to stabilize the camera and ensure a steady shot. Moreover, using continuous autofocus mode can help track the subject's movement and maintain focus throughout the scene, further enhancing the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo improve the image quality, the photographer should consider using a faster shutter speed to better capture the motion of the subjects. Since the current image is blurry, a quicker shutter speed would help freeze the motion of the woman walking and the other people in the background, making them appear sharper and more defined. Additionally, ensuring proper lighting and possibly using a tripod or stabilizing the camera can further enhance the image quality.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify main subject and suggest stabilization techniques to reduce motion blur.\n2. Recommend optimal shutter speed for capturing moving subjects clearly.\n3. Advise on composition to enhance visual interest and subject focus.",
