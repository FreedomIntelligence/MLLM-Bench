    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe landmark in the image appears to be the Sydney Opera House, an iconic architectural structure located in Sydney, Australia. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the Sydney Opera House is renowned for its unique and futuristic architectural style. The building features a series of precast concrete \"shells\" that form the roof structure, giving it a sail-like appearance. These shells are arranged in a radial pattern, creating a visually striking and distinctive silhouette.\n\nThe design concept behind the Sydney Opera House was to create a structure that would symbolize the hopes and aspirations of the people of Australia. Utzon aimed to design a building that would be a cultural center, representing the performing arts and bringing together different artistic disciplines under one roof. The use of sail-like shapes was inspired by the natural beauty of Australia's coastal landscape and the country's maritime history. The innovative engineering and design elements have made the Sydney Opera House one of the most recognizable and admired buildings in the world.\n\nIn the image, the building is illuminated with red lights, possibly as part of a special event or celebration, adding a dramatic and visually captivating effect to the scene. The reflection in the water further enhances the aesthetic appeal, emphasizing the beauty and elegance of the structure.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
