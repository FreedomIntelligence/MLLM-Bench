    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image appears to be AI-generated. Here are several reasons to support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Unrealistic Scale**: The size of the wave compared to the buildings and cars is extreme and unlikely to occur in reality. Tsunamis and large waves do not typically reach such heights in urban areas without causing catastrophic destruction.\n\n2. **Wave Structure**: The wave's shape and the way it interacts with the buildings and cars is unnatural. In real-world scenarios, such a wave would cause much more significant damage and displacement.\n\n3. **Visibility**: Despite the massive wave and the apparent chaos, the visibility is remarkably clear, and the details of the buildings and vehicles are sharp. This is unusual for a chaotic and destructive event.\n\n4. **Lack of Human Presence**: There are no visible people running, evacuating, or reacting to the wave, which is highly improbable given the imminent danger.\n\n5. **Artistic Style**: The overall composition and lighting of the image have an artistic quality that is consistent with AI-generated content.\n\nWhile AI technology has advanced significantly in creating realistic images, this particular image exhibits characteristics that make it likely to be AI-generated rather than a real photograph.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
