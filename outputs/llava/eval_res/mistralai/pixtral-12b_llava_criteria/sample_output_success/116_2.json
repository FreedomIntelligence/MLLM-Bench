    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe individual in the image appears to be expressing a sense of sadness or contemplation. They are looking down with their hands covering their mouth, which is a common gesture indicating deep thought, emotional distress, or an attempt to hide their emotions. Their posture and facial expression suggest a sense of introspection or distress.\n\nSeveral contexts or situations could be causing this emotion:\n\n1. **Personal Loss**: The person might be grieving the loss of a loved one, a pet, or a significant relationship.\n2. **Life Challenges**: They could be facing significant life challenges such as financial difficulties, health issues, or personal failures.\n3. **Emotional Overload**: The individual might be overwhelmed by emotional stress, possibly from work or personal relationships.\n4. **Reflective Moment**: They could be reflecting on past experiences or decisions that have caused them emotional pain or regret.\n5. **Isolation**: Feeling disconnected from others or isolated, possibly due to moving to a new place or experiencing social withdrawal.\n\nThe context of the image, with greenery in the background, suggests an outdoor setting, which might be a place where the person goes to find solitude and reflect on their emotions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
