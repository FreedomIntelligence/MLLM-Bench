    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the authenticity of the badge, we need to compare its design elements with standard badges from Mayberry, focusing on the following aspects:\n\n1. **Text Font and Arrangement**:\n   - Standard Mayberry badges typically feature the word \"SHERIFF\" prominently at the top and the name \"MAYBERRY\" at the bottom.\n   - The font used should be consistent with traditional law enforcement badges, often bold and sans-serif.\n\n2. **Symbols**:\n   - The presence of the star symbol in the center is common for sheriff badges.\n   - The design around the star might include decorative elements like a wreath or other ornamental details.\n\n3. **Material Appearance**:\n   - Authentic badges are usually made of metal, such as nickel, brass, or silver-plated material.\n   - The surface should have a polished, reflective finish, and the edges might be beveled or rounded.\n\n4. **Color and Embellishments**:\n   - Traditional badges often have a metallic sheen, either silver or gold.\n   - Some badges may have embellishments like small dots or stars along the edges.\n\nBy examining the provided image:\n\n1. **Text Font and Arrangement**:\n   - The word \"SHERIFF\" is prominently displayed at the top in bold, black letters.\n   - The name \"MAYBERRY\" is at the bottom, also in bold, black letters.\n   - The arrangement and font appear consistent with traditional sheriff badges from Mayberry.\n\n2. **Symbols**:\n   - There is a central star symbol, which is typical for sheriff badges.\n   - The star is surrounded by a wreath-like design, which is consistent with some historical sheriff badges.\n\n3. **Material Appearance**:\n   - The badge has a polished, reflective finish, indicating it is made of metal.\n   - The edges are beveled and adorned with small dots, which is a common embellishment for such badges.\n\n4. **Color and Embellishments**:\n   - The badge has a silver metallic sheen.\n   - The edges are decorated with small dots, adding to the authenticity of the design.\n\nBased on the analysis of the design elements, the badge appears to be authentic and consistent with traditional sheriff badges from Mayberry.\nThe badge appears to be authentic based on its design elements, including the text font and arrangement, symbols, material appearance, and embellishments, which are consistent with traditional sheriff badges from Mayberry.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
