    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features two images of a cat, one labeled \"BEFORE COFFEE\" and the other \"AFTER COFFEE.\" \n\n1. **Exaggeration in Expression:**\n   - **Before Coffee:** The cat in the first image appears to have a neutral to slightly unhappy expression. Its eyes are normal, and its mouth is closed, giving it a somewhat disinterested or grumpy look.\n   - **After Coffee:** The cat in the second image looks dramatically different. Its eyes are wide open, almost bulging, and its mouth is open with its tongue sticking out, giving it a highly exaggerated, almost comical expression of alertness or excitement.\n\n2. **Hyperbole Contribution to Humor:**\n   - **Contrast:** The meme uses the extreme contrast between the two expressions to highlight how one's mood or energy level can change after consuming coffee. This is a common trope in humor, where the exaggeration makes the point more comedic.\n   - **Relatability:** Many people can relate to feeling tired or grumpy before having their morning coffee and then feeling more alert and energetic afterward. The exaggerated depiction accentuates this common experience, making it humorous.\n   - **Visual Impact:** The drastic change in the cat's facial features is visually striking and amusing, which adds to the humor. The wide eyes and open mouth create a cartoonish effect, making the meme more entertaining.\n\nOverall, the exaggeration in the cat's expression after \"coffee\" contributes to the humor by highlighting a relatable experience in a visually exaggerated and comedic manner.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
