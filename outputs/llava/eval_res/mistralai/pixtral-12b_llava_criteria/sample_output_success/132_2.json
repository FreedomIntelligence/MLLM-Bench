    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the agricultural activity, and discuss the possible geographic or climatic conditions suggested by the image. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe agricultural activity depicted in the image is the harvesting of corn. This is evidenced by the group of people handling and organizing ears of corn in a field. The geographic or climatic conditions suggested by the image include a likely tropical or subtropical climate, suitable for corn cultivation, as indicated by the lush green corn plants and the presence of tall stalks. Additionally, the attire of the individuals, including hats and long-sleeved shirts, suggests they might be protecting themselves from sun exposure, which is common in regions with intense sunlight. The presence of a large quantity of corn also indicates a potentially productive agricultural area with favorable growing conditions.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, several people are gathered around a pile of corn. The pile consists of green, unhusked ears of corn, suggesting that the agricultural activity taking place is likely the harvest of corn from a field. The fact that the corn is green indicates that it has been recently gathered and not yet dried or processed further.\n\nAs to the geographic and climatic conditions, the presence of corn as the primary agricultural activity in this area implies that the region likely has suitable climatic conditions for corn cultivation. This may include warm temperatures and a moderate amount of rainfall. These conditions allow corn to grow and mature properly, providing the necessary food source for the people. The presence of multiple people in the image working together to harvest the corn also signifies a communal effort to gather and manage the crop, which may be a characteristic of the region's agricultural practices and social structure.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity as harvesting corn, referencing the piled ears of corn and the people.\n2. Discuss geographic or climatic conditions, considering vegetation and weather wear.\n3. Assess commonsense understanding of agricultural practices and climate impact.",
