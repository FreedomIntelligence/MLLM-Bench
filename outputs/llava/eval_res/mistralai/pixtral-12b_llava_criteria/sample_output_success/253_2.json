    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two pictures closely to identify differences between them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows two side-by-side illustrations of a young girl wearing a Santa hat and holding a gingerbread house.

In one scene, she is putting the finishing touches on the house by applying a green decoration on the roof. In the other scene, she is placing a ribbon on the house.
