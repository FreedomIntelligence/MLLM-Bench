    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBy integrating the expressions, actions, and attire of the characters in the image, could you please speculate on the likely age group to which they belong?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe group of people in the image are young, and they appear to be of high school age. They are dressed in caps and gowns, which are commonly attire for high school commencement ceremonies. Their actions, such as smiling, dancing, and celebrating, suggest that they are joyful about their accomplishments, further supporting the idea that they are young high school graduates.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the expressions, actions, and attire of the individuals in the image, it is likely that they belong to the young adult age group. This inference is supported by their graduation caps and gowns, which indicate they are completing a significant educational milestone typically associated with late teens to early twenties. Their joyous and celebratory actions, such as throwing their caps in the air and smiling broadly, are common behaviors exhibited by young adults celebrating a major life achievement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if the answer determines an age group based on graduation attire and joyful expressions.\n2. Check for reasoning that associates attire with a typical graduation age group.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects understanding of actions indicating a celebration, likely a graduation event.",
