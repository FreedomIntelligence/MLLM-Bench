    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDoes this picture suggest a sort of discrimination?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the image suggests a scene of discrimination and possibly excessive force, as it shows a young man being held down by police officers while he is wearing a hooded sweatshirt. This implies that the man might be a victim of racial profiling or other types of discrimination, as his choice of clothing might be misinterpreted as suspicious behavior by the police. It is vital for law enforcement officers to be aware of their actions and avoid engaging in such practices to ensure fairness and justice for all citizens.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the image suggests a possible scenario of discrimination or excessive use of force by law enforcement. The person being arrested is a person of color, while the officers involved appear to be predominantly white. The individual being arrested is on the ground with several officers surrounding and restraining him, which could be perceived as discriminatory or heavy-handed, depending on the context and the actions leading up to this moment. It's important to consider the broader context and any preceding events to fully understand the situation depicted in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify presence of law enforcement and individual's demeanor, assessing potential power dynamics.\n2. Analyze context and body language for indications of discrimination.\n3. Evaluate the interaction without making assumptions about individuals' identities or motivations.",
