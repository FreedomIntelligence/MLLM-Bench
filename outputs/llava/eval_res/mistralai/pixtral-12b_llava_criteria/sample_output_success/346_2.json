    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCritique the ad's implication of female competence and its potential impact on stereotypes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe vintage advertisement features a woman struggling to open a bottle, with a caption that reads, \"You mean a woman can open it?\" This type of advertisement perpetuates stereotypes about female competence and physical strength, suggesting that women might be incapable of performing simple tasks such as opening a bottle. Such messaging can be harmful because it reinforces gender biases and may discourage women from attempting certain tasks or lead others to underestimate their abilities. This advertisement can be seen as a reflection of societal attitudes at the time it was created, but it is important to recognize that these stereotypes are outdated and can be detrimental to gender equality efforts. Modern advertising should aim to portray individuals of all genders as capable and competent, regardless of traditional gender roles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a woman opening a bottle of ketchup, with the phrase \"you mean a woman can open it\" in white text, which implies that it is usually associated with men. This kind of stereotype perpetuates the notion that women are not as capable as men in tasks that involve physical strength and dexterity. This can have negative consequences on societal expectations and attitudes towards women, leading to a lack of opportunities, unequality, and limited perception of women's abilities. Such an advertisement may also promote the idea that women need to prove their competence in performing tasks that are typically considered \"manly\", reinforcing gender stereotypes and limiting the potential of women.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response recognizes the ad's implied message about female competence.\n2. Assess the response's insight on the ad's reinforcement or challenge of gender stereotypes.\n3. Evaluate the response's consideration of the potential societal impact of such stereotypes.",
