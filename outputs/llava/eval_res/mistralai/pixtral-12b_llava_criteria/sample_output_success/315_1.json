    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the equation, we can follow the steps of cross multiplication and use the distributive property.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two fractions with common numerators and denominators:\n\n(1/2) x (8/4) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can take the simplified equation to its next level by factoring the numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/2) = 2/4 = (1/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 - 1/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nThis means the equation is already simplified and there are no further steps to take. The final answer is 0.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo simplify the given complex fraction, we'll use the method of combining the numerator and the denominator into single fractions. This can be done efficiently by cross multiplication and simplification. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{x}{x+1} + 1}{1 - \\frac{x}{x-1}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's combine the numerator and the denominator into single fractions.\n\n1. **Combine the numerator:**\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{x+1} + 1 = \\frac{x}{x+1} + \\frac{x+1}{x+1} = \\frac{x + (x+1)}{x+1} = \\frac{2x+1}{x+1}\n\\]\n\n2. **Combine the denominator:**\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{x}{x-1} = \\frac{x-1}{x-1} - \\frac{x}{x-1} = \\frac{x-1-x}{x-1} = \\frac{-1}{x-1}\n\\]\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{2x+1}{x+1}}{\\frac{-1}{x-1}}\n\\]\n\n3. **Simplify by multiplying the fractions:**\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{2x+1}{x+1}}{\\frac{-1}{x-1}} = \\frac{2x+1}{x+1} \\times \\frac{x-1}{-1} = \\frac{(2x+1)(x-1)}{-(x+1)}\n\\]\n\n4. **Expand and simplify the numerator:**\n\\[\n(2x+1)(x-1) = 2x^2 - 2x + x - 1 = 2x^2 - x - 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{-(x+1)} = -\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{x+1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the cleverly simplified form of the given complex fraction is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{x+1}\n\\]\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3. Final answer should be mathematically equivalent to the original equation.",
