    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the traditional method and primary tool used by the individual and infer the specific profession based on the aquatic environment and unique equipment depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe individual is using a traditional leg-rowing method and a large conical fishing net, which indicates their primary tool is the net. This combination of techniques and equipment is characteristic of leg-rowing fishermen, particularly those found on Inle Lake in Myanmar. The specific profession inferred from these elements is that of a leg-rowing fisherman.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe traditional method depicted in the image is a fishing technique that involves using a large net, such as a parasail or a parachute, to catch fish. This method is commonly used in some Asian countries, particularly in Thailand. The primary tool used by the individual in this scene is a large net, which he carries and operates while standing on a wooden boat.\n\nBased on the aquatic environment and unique equipment, we can infer that the main profession of the individual in this image is a fisherman, particularly a net fisherman. Net fishermen use large nets to catch fish from the water, often relying on their skills and experience to navigate through the water and maneuver the heavy, large parachute-like nets. The fisherman's profession requires both physical strength and an understanding of the techniques involved in the specific fishing method.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the traditional fishing method as leg rowing and primary tool as conical fishing net.\n2. Infer the specific profession as fisherman.",
