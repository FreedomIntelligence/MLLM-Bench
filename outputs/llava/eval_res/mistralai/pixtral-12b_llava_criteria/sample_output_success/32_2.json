    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of symbol is this? Identify all elements in the symbol and describe their meanings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a recycling symbol commonly used to indicate the type of plastic material. Here is a breakdown of its elements:\n\n1. **Triangle Shape**: The symbol is a triangle composed of three arrows forming a loop.\n2. **Number 2 Inside the Triangle**: The number \"2\" in the center of the triangle indicates the type of plastic.\n3. **Abbreviation \"HDPE\"**: Below the triangle, the letters \"HDPE\" stand for High-Density Polyethylene.\n\n**Meaning**: \n- The triangle symbol with the number 2 signifies that the plastic is High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is a commonly recycled plastic used in products like milk jugs, detergent bottles, and plastic bags. HDPE is known for its strength and durability, making it suitable for various applications.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe symbol is a recycle logo, also known as the recycling arrows symbol. The symbol is usually represented by three chasing arrows forming a triangle, with the words \"HDPE\" present below the arrows. The three chasing arrows signify the process of recycling, with each arrow representing a different stage: breaking down the used material, melting it down, and remolding it into new products. The \"HDPE\" stands for high-density polyethylene, which is a type of plastic commonly used for bottles and containers. This symbol is used to indicate the recyclability of HDPE materials and encourages people to recycle items made of this type of plastic.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify symbol as resin identification code for HDPE, which is the abbreviation of High-Density Polyethylene.\n2. Explain the meaning of the triangular shape and the number 2 inside it.",
