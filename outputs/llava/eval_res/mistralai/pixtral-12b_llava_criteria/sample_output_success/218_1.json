    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the radar chart, what does Libertarianism feature?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe radar chart shows that Libertarianism features a strong emphasis on individualism, freedom, and minimal government intervention. It is located near the center of the chart, surrounded by various other ideologies, such as Postmodernism, Marxism, and Feminism. The radar chart indicates that while there is some overlap between these ideologies, Libertarianism stands out due to its primary focus on individual freedom and limited government involvement. This emphasis distinguishes it from other ideologies, which may prioritize collective rights, social equality, or broader governmental intervention.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n\nThe radar chart compares different ideologies, including Libertarianism, across several dimensions such as Individualism, Skepticism of Authority, Scientific Method, Secularism, Equality, Progress, Liberty, and Progressivism.\n\nTo determine what Libertarianism features, we need to examine the Libertarianism line on the chart. Each dimension is represented by a scale, typically from 0 to 10. By observing the points where the Libertarianism line intersects with each dimension, we can gather the following features:\n\n- Individualism: Approximately 7\n- Skepticism of Authority: Approximately 6\n- Scientific Method: Approximately 4\n- Secularism: Approximately 5\n- Equality: Approximately 2\n- Progress: Approximately 3\n- Liberty: Approximately 9\n- Progressivism: Approximately 1\n\nThese intersection points indicate the relative emphasis Libertarianism places on each dimension compared to other ideologies.\n\nThus, the features of Libertarianism according to the radar chart are:\n\n- Individualism: 7\n- Skepticism of Authority: 6\n- Scientific Method: 4\n- Secularism: 5\n- Equality: 2\n- Progress: 3\n- Liberty: 9\n- Progressivism: 1\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Libertarianism's highest score as Liberty.\n2. Identify Libertarianism's lowest score as either Equality or Progress, since these two aspects have approximately the same scores that cannot be differentiated.\n",
