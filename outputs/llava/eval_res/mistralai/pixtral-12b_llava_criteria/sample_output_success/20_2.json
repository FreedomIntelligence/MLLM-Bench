    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the possible badminton stroke being performed by the player.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe player in the image appears to be performing a badminton smash. A smash is an offensive shot where the player hits the shuttlecock powerfully and downward towards the opponent's court, typically aiming to end the rally. This stroke is executed with a lot of force and is a crucial part of an aggressive badminton strategy.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe possible badminton stroke being performed by the player is a serve. The man is seen jumping while holding a racquet, which is a common technique used in serving to generate more power and precision in the shot. The serve is an important part of a badminton game, as it initiates play and sets the tone for the rest of the rally.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the stroke as either a clear or a smash based on player's posture and racket position.",
