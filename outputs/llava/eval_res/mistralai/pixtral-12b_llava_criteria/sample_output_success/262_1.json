    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils for several reasons:\n\n1. ** from Dust and Sand**: The image depicts a severe dust storm, where sand and dust particles are being blown around by strong winds. These particles can be harmful to the eyes, nose, and mouth if inhaled or if they come into direct contact with the skin. The veils help filter the air and protect the face from these particles.\n\n2. **Preserving Moisture**: In arid environments, preserving moisture is crucial. Covering the face helps to retain moisture in the skin and reduce the loss of bodily fluids through breathing.\n\n3. **Sun Protection**: While not as intense in this image due to the dust storm, veils also provide protection from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. This is particularly important in desert environments where the sun is strong and prolonged exposure can lead to skin damage.\n\nRegarding the weather occurrence:\n\n1. **Dust Storms**: Dust storms typically occur in arid and semi-arid regions where strong winds lift loose sand and dust particles into the atmosphere. These storms can be caused by various factors, including:\n   - **Strong Wind Conditions**: When winds are strong enough, they can pick up loose particles from the ground.\n   - **Dry Soil Conditions**: In dry regions, the soil lacks moisture and is more likely to be loose and easily picked up by the wind.\n   - **Human Activities**: Activities such as farming, construction, and off-road vehicle use can also contribute to dust storms by disturbing the soil.\n\n2. **Climate Change**: Increasingly frequent and severe dust storms can be linked to climate change. Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns can exacerbate drought conditions, leading to drier soil and more frequent dust storms.\n\n3. **Geographical Factors**: Certain geographical features, such as deserts and dry riverbeds, are more prone to dust storms due to the nature of the terrain and the lack of vegetation to hold the soil in place.\n\nIn summary, the people in the image are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the dust storm, while the storm itself is likely a result of a combination of strong winds, dry soil conditions, and possibly climate change.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
