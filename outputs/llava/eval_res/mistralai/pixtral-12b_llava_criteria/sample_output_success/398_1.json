    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a series of figures in chronological order. What is the trend of change in the predicted graph? Explain the reasons for this trend of change.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph is that the waistline of the figures gradually increases from one figure to the next. This represents the accumulation of extra fat over time, which is a common concern in the context of obesity. The series of figures, each showing a person wearing blue shorts and a spaghetti-string top, are used to explain the consequences of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in obesity and its related health problems. This sequence is a visual representation of the potential health risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo analyze the trend of change in the predicted graph, we need to observe the sequence of figures and identify the pattern or trend in the changes. Here’s a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Observation**:\n   - The top row shows a sequence of male figures, and the bottom row shows a sequence of female figures.\n   - Both sequences appear to depict a change in body weight or size.\n\n2. **Identifying the Trend**:\n   - For both the male and female figures, the trend is a gradual increase in body size or weight from left to right.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Change**:\n   - **Top Row (Male Figures)**:\n     - The first figure is the thinnest.\n     - The second figure is slightly thicker.\n     - The third figure is thicker than the second.\n     - The fourth figure is even thicker.\n     - The fifth figure is the thickest.\n   - **Bottom Row (Female Figures)**:\n     - The first figure is the thinnest.\n     - The second figure is slightly thicker.\n     - The third figure is thicker than the second.\n     - The fourth figure is even thicker.\n     - The fifth figure is the thickest.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Trend**:\n   - Both sequences show a progression from thinness to obesity. This suggests an increase in body size or weight.\n\n5. **Predicting the Next Trend**:\n   - Based on the given figures, the next figures in the sequence would likely continue the trend of increasing body size or weight.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The predicted trend is a continuous increase in body size or weight.\nThe predicted trend of change in the graph is a continuous increase in body size or weight.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer recognizes the trend of increasing body weight.\n2. Assess the explanation for the rising trend, relating to the figures' changes.\n3. Confirm the answer follows a chronological analysis of the figures.",
