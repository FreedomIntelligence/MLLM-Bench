    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture appears to be the area with the wooden desk and chair positioned against the wall between the two windows. This area is well-lit with natural light from the windows and supplemented by a floor lamp, providing ample illumination for working. Additionally, the desk has storage space and shelves above it, which can be used to store office supplies and books, making it a functional workspace. The location is also close to the main entrance, offering easy access and a sense of openness due to the nearby windows, which can help reduce feelings of isolation while working.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
