    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat makes the image blurry?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is blurry due to the motion of the train and the people inside it, as indicated by the streaks of color and indistinct figures. The train's movement creates a sense of speed and activity, with the passengers appearing as blurred shapes rather than distinct individuals.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurry because it was taken on a moving train, such as a subway train or a train passing down the tracks. The motion creates a sense of blurriness or visual uncertainty, as the train and its surroundings were not stationary during capture.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the blur is due to low pixel count.\n2. Assess whether motion contributes to the image's blurriness.\n3. Evaluate if focus issues are causing the blur in the image.",
