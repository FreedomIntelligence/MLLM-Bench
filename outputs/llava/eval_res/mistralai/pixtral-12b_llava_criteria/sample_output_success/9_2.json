    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the transportation in the picture and distinguish it from traditional means of transportation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a high-speed train traveling on an elevated track structure. This type of transportation is distinguished from traditional means, such as cars or buses, by its speed and the infrastructure it utilizes. High-speed trains typically operate on dedicated tracks that are often elevated or at ground level, allowing them to cover long distances efficiently and at higher speeds than conventional trains. The train in the image is sleek and aerodynamic, designed for modern, high-speed travel, contrasting with older, slower trains or traditional ground-level rail systems.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe transportation in the picture is a train traveling across a large bridge that spans over a lush green field. This is an example of modern transportation infrastructure, which differentiates it from more traditional means of transportation, such as boats, horses, or pedestrian travel. The bridge is built to accommodate and facilitate efficient transportation of passengers and goods over the vast landscape, providing a convenient and reliable connection between different parts of the country, connecting remote areas, and supporting economic growth. The presence of the train moving swiftly through the grassy landscape illustrates the capabilities and advantages of modern transportation methods.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the high-speed train as the transportation in the image.\n2. Describe features (e.g. speed, comfprt, safety) distinguishing the high-speed train from traditional trains.",
