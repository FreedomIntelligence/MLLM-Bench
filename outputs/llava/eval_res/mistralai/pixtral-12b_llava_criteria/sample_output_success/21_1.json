    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe exercise in the image is the bench press. The bench press is a fundamental weightlifting exercise that primarily targets the chest muscles (pectorals), but also engages the shoulders (deltoids) and triceps. To perform a bench press correctly, the individual should lie on their back on a flat bench with their feet flat on the floor. They should grip the barbell with both hands, positioning their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. The barbell is then lowered to the chest, touching lightly, and then pressed back up to the starting position while maintaining control and proper form. Proper technique is essential to avoid injury and maximize gains in upper body strength and muscle development.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
