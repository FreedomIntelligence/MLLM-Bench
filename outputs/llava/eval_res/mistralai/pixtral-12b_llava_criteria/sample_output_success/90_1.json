    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the image in detail. Which bible verse perfectly describes this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man standing in a grassy field with a giant book under his feet. There are also two smaller books in the scene. The man appears to be reading the book and may be surprised by its massive size. The image seems to be a creative and surreal depiction, with the man potentially engaged in some kind of fantastical or imaginative scenario.\n\nA fitting bible verse to describe this picture would be Psalm 40:4: \"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.\" This verse emphasizes the value of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and could be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of reading and learning throughout life. In the context of the image, the man's engagement with the giant book may symbolize a pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, as well as an appreciation for the power of literature and imagination.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man standing on a large, open book situated in a grassy field. The book appears to be a significant part of the landscape, with the pages forming a pathway that the man is following. There is also a signpost with the text \"RIGHT PATH\" pointing towards the book.\n\nThis scene symbolizes the idea of guidance and the journey of life, emphasizing the importance of staying on the right path, which can be interpreted as following divine or moral guidance. A verse from the Bible that captures this theme is:\n\n\"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.\" - Psalm 119:105 (NIV)\n\nThis verse highlights the role of divine guidance and wisdom in illuminating the path ahead, much like the book and signpost in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the man, open book path, sign \"RIGHT PATH\", and relate to Psalm 119:105.\n2. Explain how the image metaphorically represents the given bible verse.",
