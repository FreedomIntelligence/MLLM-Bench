Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich parts of the map have the greatest humidity?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is a map of China showing different regions color-coded by humidity levels. The question asks which parts of the map have the greatest humidity.\n\nHere are the key observations:\n- The map uses a color gradient to represent humidity levels, ranging from light gray (38-52) to dark blue (75-82).\n- The southern and southeastern parts of China are predominantly dark blue, indicating higher humidity levels.\n- The northern and northwestern parts of China are mostly light gray, indicating lower humidity levels.\n\nThese observations are relevant because:\n- The color gradient provides a visual representation of humidity levels across different regions.\n- The dark blue regions indicate the highest humidity levels, which are concentrated in the south and southeast.\n- The light gray regions indicate the lowest humidity levels, which are concentrated in the north and northwest.\n\nNo calculations are required for this analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, the parts of the map with the greatest humidity are the southern and southeastern regions of China, which are color-coded in dark blue (75-82).\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the map, the areas with the highest humidity levels are located around the eastern part of China.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the area with the darkest shade representing the highest humidity range.\n2. Reference the legend to confirm the highest humidity value.\n3. Describe the geographic location of the area with the greatest humidity.",
