    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe facial expressions and body language of the subjects suggest a formal and ceremonial context. The central individual, seated and wearing a hat and ornate robe, appears relaxed but dignified, indicative of a prominent role, possibly a leader or a shaman. His smile and direct gaze at the camera imply a sense of comfort and confidence. The two standing individuals, positioned on either side of the central figure, maintain a more formal stance with neutral expressions and hands resting on the table. Their attire, which includes elaborate robes and black hats, suggests they are in supportive roles, possibly assistants or attendants. The overall body language and facial expressions convey a sense of tradition, respect, and formality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
