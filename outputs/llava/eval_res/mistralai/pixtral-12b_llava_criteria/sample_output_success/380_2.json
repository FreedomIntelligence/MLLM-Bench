    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the player's current motion and positioning relative to the soccer ball to predict the success of the save, and the consequent positioning of players following the save attempt.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe goalkeeper is jumping to his right, indicating that he anticipates the ball coming towards the top right corner of the goal. Given his extended reach and the trajectory of the ball, it appears likely that the goalkeeper will successfully save the shot. Consequently, the players in red jerseys (numbers 10 and 9) will likely react by moving towards the ball to potentially regain possession, while the players in white jerseys (number 5 and others) will reposition themselves to defend against a potential rebound or counterattack.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe goalkeeper has stretched his arms out to catch the soccer ball and seems to be in a good position to save it. The ball is still in the air, and the goalkeeper is focused on stopping it. Based on the position of the players on the field, there are a total of 10 outfield players and 3 goalkeepers from both teams.\n\nFollowing the save, the goalkeeper will likely throw the ball back towards the other end of the field, and the outfield players will reposition themselves to recover possession or defend against the opposing team's next attack. The player who shot the ball (number 10) will likely try to move towards the goal area or the center of the field to create a scoring opportunity for his team. Players from both teams are likely to adjust their positions to maintain a defensive or attacking stance, depending on their teammates' actions, the ball's direction, and the momentary game situation regarding possession and scoring opportunities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess goalkeeper's motion and likelihood of reaching the ball for a save.\n2. Predict the ball's trajectory post-save and players' subsequent positions.\n3. Evaluate the positioning and potential actions of nearby outfield players.",
