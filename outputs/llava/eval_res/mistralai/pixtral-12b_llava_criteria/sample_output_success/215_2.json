    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe chart is a line graph depicting the global mean temperature compared to the 1850-1900 average, with data sourced from various datasets spanning different time periods. The x-axis represents the years from 1850 to 2023, while the y-axis shows the temperature deviation in degrees Celsius from the 1850-1900 average. Each line represents a different dataset, distinguished by color and labeled accordingly. The chart reveals a general upward trend in global temperatures over time, with notable increases in the latter half of the 20th century and continuing into the 21st century. This trend is consistent across all datasets, indicating a robust consensus among different data sources. The variability and fluctuations in the earlier years show more pronounced differences among datasets, while the recent decades exhibit a convergence towards higher temperatures. The key insight from this chart is the clear evidence of global warming, with temperatures rising significantly above the 1850-1900 baseline, underscoring the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change on global temperature trends.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
