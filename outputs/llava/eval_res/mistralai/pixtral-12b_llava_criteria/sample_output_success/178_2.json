Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat would be the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image? The image size is 1300*1300\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo determine the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image, we need to estimate its position visually. Given that the image size is 1300x1300 pixels, we can approximate the coordinates. Here's an educated guess:\n\n- **Top-left corner (x, y):** (500, 100)\n- **Bottom-right corner (x, y):** (800, 300)\n\nThese coordinates suggest that the strawberry is located towards the top of the image and covers a portion of it. \n\nPlease note that these coordinates are approximate and should be verified with actual pixel measurements if precise localization is required.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n[0.41, 0.05, 0.76, 0.28]\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of the strawberry's bounding box coordinates.\n2. Bounding box should tightly enclose the entire strawberry.\n3. Coordinates must be accurate relative to the image's dimensions.",
