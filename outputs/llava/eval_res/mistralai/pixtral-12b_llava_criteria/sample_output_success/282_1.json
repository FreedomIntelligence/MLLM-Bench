    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease infer the occupation of the adult depicted in the picture, taking into account his actions and role within the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGiven the scene, with a man sitting in a chair surrounded by several young children and smiling, it is likely that the adult is a teacher or an educator. His role and interaction with the children indicate that he might be a teacher who is engaging with his students, teaching them or helping them learn in some way.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe adult depicted in the picture is likely a teacher or an educator. This inference is based on his role interacting with young children in a classroom setting, sitting on a small chair to be at their level, and engaging with them in what appears to be a group activity or discussion. The classroom environment, complete with educational posters and learning materials, further supports the conclusion that he is a teacher or educator.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must infer the adult is a teacher based on his interaction with children and classroom setting.2. Check for the presence of educational materials or environment indicative of teaching.",
