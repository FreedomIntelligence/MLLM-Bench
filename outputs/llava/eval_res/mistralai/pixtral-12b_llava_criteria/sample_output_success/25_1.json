Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the woman doing? Why does she hold a microphone?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman is singing with her mouth wide open while holding a microphone. She is likely at a concert or a live event, where she is the main performer. Holding a microphone is essential for amplifying her voice so that the audience can hear her clearly and loudly. The woman's dramatic performance, combined with her full-mouthed singing, enhances the energy and excitement of the event, engaging the audience and creating a memorable experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman is singing passionately, and she holds a microphone to amplify her voice and ensure that it can be heard clearly by the audience. Singing into a microphone is a common practice in live performances, concerts, and other public events where vocal projection is essential to reach a larger crowd. The microphone helps to capture her voice and transmit it through speakers, allowing the audience to enjoy the performance without missing any details.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
