    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the relationship between two birds in the image, what kind of natural relation do they show?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a parent bird feeding its chick, illustrating a natural nurturing and feeding relationship between the two birds. This behavior is typical in many bird species where parents provide food to their young until they are independent.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are two birds, one small and one large. They are perched together on a tree branch with the small bird having its mouth open and the larger bird leaning over to feed it. This scene demonstrates a nurturing relationship between the two birds, where the larger one is providing food and care for the smaller bird. This is a natural behavior observed in many bird species, particularly when parent birds feed their offspring or when one bird helps another in times of need. The fact that the larger bird is feeding the smaller bird signifies a bonding experience and cooperation between the two species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify brood parasitism as the natural relationship depicted.",
