Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the flow chart, as a undergraduate student who did not draw much attention, what should I call my professor who does not have a PhD?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo determine the appropriate title for a professor who does not have a PhD and is not particularly well-known to an undergraduate student, we can follow the flowchart step-by-step.\n\n1. **Are you an undergraduate?**\n   - Yes (we are an undergraduate).\n\n2. **Do you have a death wish?**\n   - No (we do not have a death wish).\n\n3. **Is your professor female?**\n   - This question doesn't apply to us since we don't know the gender of our professor.\n\n4. **Does your Professor have Ph.D?**\n   - No (our professor does not have a Ph.D).\n\nNext, the flowchart directs us to the question:\n   - **Do you want to be?**\n\nSince we are unsure of the professor's preferences, we should follow the flowchart's advice:\n   - **You're probably ok calling them by their first name, but proceed with caution!**\n\nThus, the flowchart suggests calling the professor by their first name, but with caution.\n\n**Final Answer:** Call the professor by their first name, but proceed with caution.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs an undergraduate student, it is advisable for you to call your professor who does not have a PhD by their proper academic title followed by their first name, unless they explicitly request a different form of address. According to the flowchart, if you need to call this particular professor, you should start by calling them by their title (e.g., \"Professor Smith\") followed by their first name (\"Professor Smith\"). Always be respectful and courteous when addressing your professors, regardless of their educational background.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies path for undergrad students and professors without a PhD.\n2. Answer adheres to the chart's decision: \"Professor So and So.\"\n3. Response reflects understanding of the humor in the chart.",
