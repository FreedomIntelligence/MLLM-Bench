    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a small, rectangular electronic device branded \"AVAccess\" placed on top of a tablet. The device has several sockets, each with a specific functionality:\n\n1. **Power Button**: Used to turn the device on or off.\n2. **USB-C Port**: This port is typically used for data transfer and charging. It supports high-speed data transfer and can be used with a variety of devices, including laptops and smartphones.\n3. **USB Port**: This standard USB port is used for connecting peripheral devices such as keyboards, mice, and external storage drives.\n4. **USB-C PD Port**: This port is used for Power Delivery, meaning it can provide higher power levels to charge laptops and other devices more quickly.\n5. **SD Card Slot**: This slot is used for inserting an SD card, which can be used for expanding storage or transferring data from cameras and other devices.\n6. **HDMI Port**: This port is used for connecting the device to monitors or TVs, allowing for high-definition video output.\n7. **Ethernet Port**: This port is used for connecting to a wired network, providing a stable and fast internet connection.\n8. **Audio Jack**: This port is used for connecting headphones or speakers, allowing for audio output.\n\nThe tablet below the device is likely used to showcase the compatibility and compact size of the AVAccess device.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
