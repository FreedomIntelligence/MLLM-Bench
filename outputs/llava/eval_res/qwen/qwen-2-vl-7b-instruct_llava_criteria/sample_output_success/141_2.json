    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss how the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe costume, accessories, and the individual's expression all contribute to creating a comedic character in this image. Here's how they work together:\n\n1. **Costume:**\n   - The individual is dressed in a colorful and elaborate costume that resembles a jester or a medieval clown. The bright colors and patterns are eye-catching and add to the whimsical and exaggerated nature of the character.\n   - The costume includes a hat with a large, exaggerated ear, which is a classic jester feature, further emphasizing the comedic and absurd nature of the character.\n\n2. **Accessories:**\n   - The individual is wearing a necklace with a circular pendant that has the word \"IDIOT!\" on it. This accessory not only adds to the costume's quirky appearance but also reinforces the comedic and self-deprecating theme.\n   - The presence of a metal tankard, which is traditionally associated with jesters, adds to the authenticity of the costume and suggests that the character might be engaging in a humorous or playful act, such as drinking or making jokes.\n\n3. **Expression:**\n   - The individual's expression is one of exaggerated surprise or astonishment. This facial expression, combined with the costume and accessories, creates a humorous and engaging image. The viewer is drawn to the character's reaction, which is a common comedic device used to elicit laughter or amusement.\n\nTogether, these elements create a cohesive and humorous character that is likely meant to entertain or amuse the audience. The combination of the costume, accessories, and expression effectively communicates a sense of fun and whimsy, making the character memorable and engaging.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character through various elements that contribute to the overall effect. The man is wearing a clown costume, which already has a humorous and exaggerated look. He is also dressed like a jester, further emphasizing the comedic nature of his appearance. Additionally, he is wearing a funny hat and a beard, adding to the overall goofy and lighthearted vibe of the character.\n\nThe individual's expression contributes to the comedic effect of the scene. He is making a funny face, likely indicating that he is posing for a joke or entertaining others. His wide open eyes and the playful pose make the character even more amusing.\n\nLastly, the man is holding a cup or a metal mug, which could be used as a prop for his humorous act or a drink for a celebration. All these elements work together to create a comedic character that is visually entertaining and engaging.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
