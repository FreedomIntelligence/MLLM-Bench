    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain how the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit could be perceived as humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image comes from the juxtaposition of the pineapple, a natural and inanimate object, with human-like accessories such as sunglasses and a white headband. These items are typically associated with humans and are used to enhance their appearance or convey a certain style. By placing these accessories on a pineapple, the image creates a playful and whimsical scene that subverts expectations. The pineapple, with its sunglasses and headband, almost appears to be a character with a personality, adding a touch of humor and imagination to the image. The use of such accessories on a fruit is unexpected and amusing, making the image stand out and evoke a smile.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses and a hat, to a pineapple can be perceived as humorous because it gives the fruit a quirky and amusing appearance. This unconventional combination of a fruit and human-like accessories can be seen as a playful statement and may evoke laughter or amusement in viewers. The image of the pineapple with sunglasses lying on a bed on a blanket adds to the lighthearted and comical nature of the scene, as it is an atypical, whimsical depiction of a commonly seen object.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the accessory (sunglasses) and its typical human use.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing fruit by accessorizing.\n3. Discuss the incongruity between the pineapple and sunglasses.",
