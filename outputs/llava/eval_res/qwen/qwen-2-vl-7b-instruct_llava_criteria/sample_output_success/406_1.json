    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features an orange tabby cat lounging on a concrete surface, likely a sidewalk or patio. The cat is positioned in the foreground, and its body is stretched out in a relaxed manner. The cat's fur is a mix of orange and white, with distinct stripes running along its back and sides. Its eyes are open, and it appears to be looking directly at the camera with a calm and content expression.\n\nIn the background, there is a modern building with large windows and a series of vertical columns. The building has a light-colored exterior, possibly beige or light gray, and features a row of windows that are divided into smaller panes. The windows are clean and reflect some light, indicating that the photograph was taken during the day. The columns are dark-colored, adding a contrast to the lighter background of the building.\n\nThe overall environment suggests an urban or semi-urban setting, possibly a campus or a public area. The concrete surface on which the cat is lying is smooth and clean, and the lighting is natural, with sunlight casting shadows on the ground and the cat. The combination of the modern building and the relaxed cat creates a serene and peaceful atmosphere.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
