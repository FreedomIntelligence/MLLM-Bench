    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a person with their hands pressed against a glass surface, with one hand covering their face and the other hand flat against the glass. The person appears to be looking through the glass, possibly from the inside to the outside, or vice versa. The setting seems to be outdoors, with greenery in the background.\n\n### Emotion Expression:\n- **Emotion:** The person appears to be expressing a sense of frustration, anxiety, or discomfort. The act of pressing hands against a glass surface can be a symbolic representation of wanting to escape or break free from something.\n- **Body Language:** The posture, with hands pressing against the glass, suggests a strong desire to move or escape, which can be indicative of feelings of confinement or restriction.\n\n### Contexts or Situations:\n1. **Confined Space:** The person might be feeling trapped in a small or enclosed space, such as a room with limited windows or a crowded area where they feel overwhelmed.\n2. **Relationship Issues:** The person could be experiencing a conflict or disagreement with someone on the other side of the glass, such as a partner or family member, leading to feelings of frustration or discomfort.\n3. **Physical or Emotional Restriction:** The person might be physically restrained or emotionally restricted, such as being a prisoner or feeling socially isolated.\n4. **Escape or Freedom:** The person could be seeking to escape from a situation or environment that they find unpleasant or dangerous, such as a toxic workplace or a relationship.\n5. **Mental Health Issues:** The person might be experiencing anxiety or depression, leading to a sense of being trapped or unable to move forward.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a strong sense of emotional struggle and a desire for freedom or escape.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
