    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could have caused the localized burning damage on this gas stove?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe localized burning damage on the gas stove is likely caused by several factors. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1. **Improper Use**: If the stove was used improperly, such as leaving it on for an extended period without supervision or using it with flammable materials nearby, it could have led to a fire.\n\n2. **Faulty Ignition System**: Issues with the ignition system, such as a faulty igniter or a clogged pilot light, can cause the stove to overheat and eventually ignite.\n\n3. **Excessive Heat**: If the burner was turned on for too long without proper ventilation, it could have generated excessive heat, leading to the localized burn.\n\n4. **Clogged Burner Ports**: Clogged burner ports can cause uneven heat distribution and lead to hot spots, which could ignite.\n\n5. **Material Flammability**: The material used in the stove's construction might have been flammable, contributing to the burn.\n\n6. **Electrical Issues**: If there were electrical issues or a short circuit, it could have caused the stove to overheat.\n\nTo prevent future incidents, it's important to regularly clean the stove, ensure proper ventilation, and avoid using it with flammable materials.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe localized burning damage on the gas stovetop could have been caused by a variety of factors. These may include overheating due to high heat settings, prolonged use, or an accumulation of food debris, grease, or other flammable materials on the surface. It is also possible that there may have been a malfunction or leak in the gas supply system, leading to uncontrolled burning. Additionally, the stove could have been mishandled accidentally, resulting in the damage. Regardless of the cause, it is essential to address such damage promptly to ensure the safety and proper functioning of the appliance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify possible causes for the localized burning on the gas stove, such as overboiling, high flame setting, flame impingement, combustible materials left on stove, delayed ignition, prolonged exposure to heat.",
