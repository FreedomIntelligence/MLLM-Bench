Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the phase of the hunting sequence the eagle is in.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe eagle in the image appears to be in the \"catch\" phase of its hunting sequence. This phase typically follows the \"pounce\" phase, where the eagle dives from a high altitude towards its prey. In the \"catch\" phase, the eagle's talons are extended and it uses them to grab the prey, as seen in this image where the eagle is holding a fish in its talons. The wings are spread wide, and the bird is in a dynamic posture, indicating it has just caught its prey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe eagle is in the phase where it is either preparing to catch its prey or has just captured it. In the image, the eagle is in flight and has its wings fanned out, which indicates that it is actively engaged in its hunting process. The eagle could be in the initial stage where it is scanning the surroundings, or it might be in the final stage where it has successfully grabbed its prey and is preparing to return to its nest or another safe location. Eagles typically have exceptional eyesight and precision, making them highly adept at capturing their prey during these flying sequences.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm eagle has caught prey, based on talon-prey contact and relative position.\n2. Describe the eagle's action, indicating the hunting sequence phase.",
