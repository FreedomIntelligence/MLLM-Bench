    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a compact, rectangular device labeled \"AV Access.\" It appears to be a connectivity hub or adapter, likely used to connect various devices to a computer or other compatible device. The device is placed on top of an iPad, suggesting it is designed to work with Apple devices.\n\nHere are the identifiable objects and their potential functionalities:\n\n1. **AV Access Label**: This is the brand name of the device, indicating that it is an AV (Audio Video) connectivity hub.\n\n2. **USB Ports**: There are two USB ports on the front of the device. These are likely used for connecting USB devices such as keyboards, mice, or external storage drives.\n\n3. **USB-C Port**: There is a USB-C port on the front of the device. This port can be used for charging and data transfer, as well as connecting to newer devices that support USB-C.\n\n4. **SD Card Reader**: There is an SD card reader on the front of the device. This allows for easy data transfer from SD cards to the connected computer or device.\n\n5. **Audio Jack**: There is an audio jack on the front of the device. This is used for connecting headphones or speakers, enabling audio output.\n\n6. **Power Button**: There is a power button on the front of the device. This is used to turn the device on and off.\n\n7. **LED Indicators**: There are several LED indicators on the front of the device, likely showing the status of the power, network connection, and other functionalities.\n\n8. **HDMI Port**: There is an HDMI port on the front of the device. This is used for connecting to a monitor or TV to output video and audio.\n\nIn summary, this AV Access device is designed to provide a range of connectivity options, including USB, USB-C, SD card, audio, and HDMI, making it a versatile hub for connecting various devices to a computer or other compatible device.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
