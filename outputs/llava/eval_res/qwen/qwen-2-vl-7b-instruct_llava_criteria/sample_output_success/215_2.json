    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis chart shows the global mean temperature over time, compared to the average temperature from 1850 to 1900. The data is sourced from various organizations and covers different time periods, as indicated by the labels on the left side of the chart.\n\nKey observations from the chart include:\n\n1. **Overall Increase**: The global mean temperature has been increasing over time. This is evident from the upward trend in all the data series.\n\n2. **Variability Over Time**: There is significant variability in the temperature data from year to year. This is seen in the fluctuations around the trend line.\n\n3. **Different Time Periods**: The data covers different time periods, with some series starting earlier (e.g., 1850) and others starting later (e.g., 1940). This allows for a comparison of temperature trends over different historical periods.\n\n4. **Sources of Data**: The chart credits the data sources, which include HadCRUT5, NOAA Global Temp, Kadow et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5. Each source may have its own methodology and data collection approach, which can affect the specific temperature values reported.\n\nOverall, the chart illustrates the increasing global mean temperature over time, with variations that reflect different historical periods and data sources.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
