The family members include both children and adults, portraying a diverse and close-knit gathering.\n\nThe photograph is surrounded by several text blocks, providing information or descriptions related to the family or the event depicted. Some of the text is in a distinctive font, making it easily readable and emphasizing the importance of the information displayed. An aerial image can be seen in the background of the photograph, showing the outdoor setting where the family is posing, possibly a garden or a yard.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
