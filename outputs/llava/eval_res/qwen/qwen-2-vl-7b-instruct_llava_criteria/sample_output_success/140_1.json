    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in this meme is primarily slapstick. It employs a visual gag involving a dog and a human, creating a humorous contrast between their reactions and actions.\n\n1. **Contrast Between Characters**: The top panel shows a person saying \"Oh look at that dog\" while the other person responds with \"I hate dogs.\" This sets up a contrast between the person's curiosity and the other person's aversion, which is a common slapstick trope.\n\n2. **Unexpected Turn of Events**: In the bottom panel, the dog appears to be the one driving the car, which is an unexpected and absurd scenario. This is a classic slapstick element, as it reverses the roles and expectations, leading to a humorous and unexpected outcome.\n\n3. **Visual Juxtaposition**: The dog's expression, which looks smug and confident, juxtaposed with the human characters' expressions and reactions, adds to the humor. The dog's \"This is the way!\" line further emphasizes its confident and perhaps mischievous demeanor.\n\n4. **Textual Play**: The text \"NAFO OFAN\" at the bottom adds a layer of absurdity and confusion, which is typical in slapstick humor, as it often involves unexpected or nonsensical elements.\n\nOverall, the meme uses slapstick humor through the contrast of expectations, unexpected actions, and absurd visual elements.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
