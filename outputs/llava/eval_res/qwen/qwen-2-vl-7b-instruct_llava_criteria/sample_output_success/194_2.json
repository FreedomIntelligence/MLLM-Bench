    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis ECG image shows a 12-lead ECG with standard leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) and augmented limb leads (V1, V2, V3). The ECG is recorded with a paper speed of 25 mm/s and a voltage sensitivity of 1 mV/mm.\n\n### ECG Waveforms and Abnormalities:\n\n1. **P Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Small, upright in leads II, III, and aVF, and negative in aVR.\n   - **Abnormality:** The P waves are generally normal in this ECG.\n\n2. **QRS Complex:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Normal in shape and duration (typically < 0.12 seconds).\n   - **Abnormality:** The QRS complexes are normal in this ECG.\n\n3. **T Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads I, II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** The T waves are generally upright and symmetrical.\n   - **Abnormality:** The T waves are generally normal in this ECG.\n\n4. **U Wave:**\n   - **Location:** Leads II, III, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.\n   - **Appearance:** Sometimes visible but not always present.\n   - **Abnormality:** The U waves are generally not present in this ECG.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- **Heart Rate:** The heart rate is within normal limits.\n- **Rhythm:** The rhythm appears to be regular.\n- **Axis:** The QRS axis is normal, indicating the direction of electrical depolarization of the ventricles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities in the P, QRS, or T waves. The heart rate and rhythm are within normal limits. There are no signs of atrial or ventricular abnormalities, and the ECG is consistent with a healthy heart.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
