    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe cat's expression in the \"After Coffee\" image is exaggerated to the point where it appears as if the cat is either about to vomit or is experiencing a severe reaction to coffee. The eyes are wide open, the mouth is open wide, and the fur appears to be standing on end, giving the cat a look of extreme surprise, shock, or distress.\n\nThis hyperbole contributes to the humor of the meme by creating a exaggerated and over-the-top reaction to the idea of coffee. The extreme expressions of the cat before and after coffee create a contrast that is both amusing and relatable. It plays on the common belief that coffee can have a dramatic effect on energy levels and mood, and by exaggerating this effect, the meme amplifies the humor. The humor is derived from the absurdity of the exaggerated reaction, making it a playful and entertaining take on the idea of coffee's effects.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
