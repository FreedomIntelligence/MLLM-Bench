    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe badge in the image is an imitation of a sheriff's badge from the fictional town of Mayberry, as seen in the television series \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" Here are the key design elements and comparisons to determine its authenticity:\n\n1. **Shape and Structure**:\n   - The badge is a six-pointed star, which is a common shape for sheriff's badges in the United States.\n\n2. **Text and Font**:\n   - The text \"SHERIFF\" and \"MAYBERRY\" is present. The font used for \"SHERIFF\" is bold and capitalized, which is typical for official badges.\n   - The font for \"MAYBERRY\" is also bold and capitalized, maintaining consistency with official designs.\n\n3. **Symbols and Design**:\n   - There is a white star in the center of the badge, which is a common symbol on sheriff's badges.\n   - The badge has a decorative border with small, raised dots, adding to its ornate appearance.\n\n4. **Material Appearance**:\n   - The badge appears to be made of metal, with a shiny, reflective surface, which is typical for official badges.\n\n5. **Material and Finish**:\n   - The badge has a metallic finish, with a silver or chrome-like appearance, which is consistent with official badges.\n\nGiven these design elements, the badge appears to be an accurate imitation of a Mayberry sheriff's badge. It closely matches the standard design elements and materials used for official sheriff's badges in the United States.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
