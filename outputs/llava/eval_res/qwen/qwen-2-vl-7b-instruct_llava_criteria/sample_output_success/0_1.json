    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the primary structure in the image and describe its architectural style and features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe primary structure in the image is the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge in New York City, built in 1883. It spans over the East River, connecting the borough of Brooklyn with Manhattan. The bridge has a distinctive twin-tower design, with two towers at the abutments on each end of the bridge. These towers house the cable supports and carry the weight of the suspended bridge deck, which is suspended from them. The bridge's architectural style is a blend of Gothic and Romanesque influences, making it an important historical and cultural landmark.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary structure in the image is the Manhattan Bridge, a suspension bridge located in New York City. The bridge is characterized by its distinctive truss arch design, which consists of a series of triangular metal trusses that provide structural support. The bridge's arch is painted in a golden color, which is a distinctive feature of the Manhattan Bridge. The bridge spans across the East River, connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn, and is a popular landmark in the city. The surrounding buildings in the image are also notable for their architectural style, which includes a mix of historic and modern elements. The buildings are primarily made of brick and stone, with some featuring ornate facades and decorative elements. The street below the bridge is lined with parked cars and trees, adding to the urban atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the primary structure as a bridge.\n2. Describe the architectural style of the bridge (e.g., suspension, cable-stayed).\n3. Mention specific features of the bridge (e.g., towers, cables).",
