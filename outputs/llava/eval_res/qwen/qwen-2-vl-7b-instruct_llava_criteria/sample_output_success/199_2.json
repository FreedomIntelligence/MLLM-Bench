    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19 antigens. This type of test is commonly referred to as an antigen test or an antigen rapid test.\n\nThe two lines on the test kit have the following meanings:\n1. The first line (C line) is a control line. It indicates that the test has been performed correctly. The presence of this line is essential for the test to be valid.\n2. The second line (T line) is the test line. It indicates a positive result for COVID-19 antigens. The presence of this line suggests that the person tested is likely infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nIn the image, there is only one line visible in the test area, which means the test result is negative, indicating that no COVID-19 antigens were detected in the sample.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
