    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo infer future automotive design evolution from current trends, we need to analyze the current design trends in the automotive industry. Some of the key trends include:\n\n1. **Electric and Hybrid Vehicles**: The increasing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles indicates a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly designs. This trend is likely to continue, with more advancements in battery technology and increased demand for electric vehicles.\n\n2. **Autonomous Driving**: The development of autonomous driving technology is reshaping the automotive industry. Designs are becoming more minimalist, with fewer external features like mirrors and steering wheels, as these are no longer necessary for autonomous vehicles.\n\n3. **Connected Cars**: The integration of internet connectivity into vehicles is becoming more common. This trend is likely to continue, with more advanced features like in-vehicle navigation, entertainment systems, and safety features that are wirelessly connected to the internet.\n\n4. **Sustainable Materials**: There is a growing trend towards using sustainable materials in vehicle design, such as recycled plastics, biodegradable materials, and lightweight materials like carbon fiber. This trend is likely to continue, with more focus on reducing the environmental impact of automotive manufacturing.\n\n5. **Personalized Design**: Consumers are increasingly looking for personalized vehicles that reflect their individual styles and preferences. This trend is likely to continue, with more customization options available for exterior and interior design.\n\n6. **Performance and Efficiency**: There is a growing focus on improving vehicle performance and efficiency, with more advanced engine technologies and aerodynamic designs. This trend is likely to continue, with more emphasis on fuel efficiency and performance.\n\n7. **Safety Features**: The inclusion of advanced safety features, such as lane departure warning systems and automatic emergency braking, is becoming more common. This trend is likely to continue, with more focus on improving overall vehicle safety.\n\nBy analyzing these current trends, we can infer that future automotive design evolution will likely focus on sustainability, connectivity, autonomous driving, personalized design, performance, efficiency, and safety.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
