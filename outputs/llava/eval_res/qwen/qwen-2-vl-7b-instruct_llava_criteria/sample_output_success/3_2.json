    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and indicate the use case of the item.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the image is a robotic floor cleaner. The use case of this item is to automate the process of cleaning floors, typically in commercial or industrial settings. The robotic cleaner is designed to move around and clean floors without human intervention, making it suitable for environments where manual cleaning would be impractical or inefficient.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a small blue, round machine with wheels, called a floor scraper, standing in a building with wood pallets. The floor scraper is designed for removing dirt, debris, and other small items from floors, which helps to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in the area. In this particular image, the machine is sitting on a dirt floor, possibly at the end of a workday, with the work done for the moment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a cleaner robot.\n2. Describe the robot's use case, such as cleaning floors autonomously.",
