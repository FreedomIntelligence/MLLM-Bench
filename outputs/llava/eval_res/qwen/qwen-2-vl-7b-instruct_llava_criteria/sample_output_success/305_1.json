    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBetween the two towel materials depicted in the picture, which one exhibits greater water absorbency when the towels are new?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nWhen the towels are new, the bamboo towels are likely to exhibit greater water absorbency compared to cotton towels. Bamboo is a natural, plant-based fiber that absorbs water more efficiently, which means it can dry faster and more effectively. Cotton towels, on the other hand, are known for their softness and comfort but may not absorb water as quickly or be as water-repellent as bamboo towels. However, please keep in mind that the actual water absorbency of these towels depends on factors like the towel's construction and quality, so the comparison is based on general trends.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bamboo towels on the right side of the picture exhibit greater water absorbency when the towels are new. Bamboo fibers are known for their natural moisture-wicking properties, which make them highly absorbent.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference bamboo towels' greater water absorbency.\n2. Analyze absorbency based on towel materials, not appearance.",
