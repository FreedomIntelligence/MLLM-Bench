    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nOnce upon a time, in a world where the sky was a canvas of endless possibilities, a young adventurer named Alex embarked on a journey. The road before him was wide and open, stretching out like a ribbon of hope into the horizon. The air was thick with the scent of fresh beginnings, and the fog that rolled in from the distant mountains added a layer of mystery to the landscape.\n\nAlex was dressed in a black jacket and pants, his sneakers making a soft tread on the asphalt. He leaped into the air, arms outstretched, feeling the wind rush past him. It was as if the world had paused, and he was the only one who could hear the whispering of the fog and the distant calls of the unknown.\n\nAs he landed on the road, Alex felt a sense of freedom unlike any he had experienced before. The road, with its yellow line marking the path, seemed to beckon him forward, promising adventures and challenges that lay just beyond the fog. He knew that every step he took would reveal new horizons, and with each leap, he felt his spirit soaring higher.\n\nThe journey ahead was filled with uncertainties, but Alex was ready. He understood that the road was not just a path to follow but a metaphor for life itself. It represented the unknown, the possibilities, and the courage it takes to explore them. With each twist and turn, he learned to trust his instincts and embrace the unexpected.\n\nAs the fog lifted and the sun began to peek through the clouds, Alex realized that the true journey was not just about reaching a destination but about the journey itself. He was grateful for the chance to leap into the unknown, to leave behind the familiar and embrace the extraordinary. And as he continued on his path, he knew that no matter where the road took him, he would always find the courage to leap into the unknown, chasing dreams and creating his own path in the world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3.
