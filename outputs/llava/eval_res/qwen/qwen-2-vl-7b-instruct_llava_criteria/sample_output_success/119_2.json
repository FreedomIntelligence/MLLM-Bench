    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotion conveyed by the statue and analyze any symbolism that might be associated with the serenity of the expression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe statue in the image appears to convey a sense of serenity and calmness. The closed eyes and slight smile suggest a peaceful and contemplative state. This expression can be associated with various forms of meditation, mindfulness, and spiritual reflection.\n\nSymbolically, the serene expression often represents a connection to the divine, inner peace, and a sense of tranquility. It may also be associated with the practice of Buddhism or other spiritual traditions that emphasize inner peace and enlightenment. The statue could be depicting a deity, a monk, or a figure of spiritual significance, and the serene expression underscores the importance of tranquility and inner peace in spiritual practice.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe statue displays a serene and calm expression, as the woman's eyes are half closed, and her lips are together in a peaceful manner. This peacefulness in the statue could symbolize various aspects such as tranquility, inner peace, contentment, or even enlightenment. The statue's serene expression is likely meant to evoke a sense of calmness and harmony, encouraging viewers to connect with their own inner peace and quiet reflection. The decorative headpiece and the overall design of the statue further emphasize the harmony and balance that the figure represents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotion of the statue's expression as serene, peaceful, or similar.\n2. Analyze symbolism related to the statue's serenity, like attire or objects held.",
