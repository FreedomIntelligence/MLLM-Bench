    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two images closely to identify and compare the differences between them as many as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are the differences between the two images:\n\n1. The dog in the left image has a blue collar, while the dog in the right image has an orange collar.\n2. The dog in the left image is standing, while the dog in the right image is sitting.\n3. The bone in the bowl in the left image is white, while the bone in the bowl in the right image is brown.\n4. The grass in the left image is green, while the grass in the right image is yellow.\n5. The flowers in the left image are red, while the flowers in the right image are pink.\n6. The dog's tail in the left image is pointing to the right, while the dog's tail in the right image is pointing to the left.\n7. The dog's ears in the left image are flopped over, while the dog's ears in the right image are upright.\n8. The dog's eyes in the left image are closed, while the dog's eyes in the right image are open.\n9. The dog's mouth in the left image is closed, while the dog's mouth in the right image is open.\n10. The dog's legs in the left image are straight, while the dog's legs in the right image are bent.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two images show a brown and black dog in different poses and settings. The first image features the dog carrying a bottle in its mouth, with one paw on a bowl and the other paw on a cat. The dog appears to be placing the bottle into the bowl. The second image displays the dog with a bone in its mouth, standing next to a house.\n\nIn the first image, the dog is positioned more towards the left side, while in the second image, it is positioned more towards the right side. Although both images show the dog in action, there are some noticeable differences in the objects the dog is carrying and its surroundings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in dog's eye, collar, posture of the dog's leg, bowl contents, flower, stone, fence knot, grass near the fence, dog house window, and bush.",
