    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork in the image is a painting that belongs to the Cubist art movement. Cubism is characterized by the use of geometric shapes and fragmented forms to represent subjects. The painting features:\n\n1. **Geometric Shapes**: The faces are composed of simple geometric shapes, such as triangles, squares, and circles, which are used to represent the facial features.\n\n2. **Fragmentation**: The faces are not depicted in a traditional, continuous manner but are broken down into smaller, overlapping sections, creating a sense of depth and complexity.\n\n3. **Lack of Perspective**: The painting does not adhere to traditional perspective rules, allowing for multiple viewpoints and angles within the same image.\n\n4. **Color and Texture**: The use of vibrant, contrasting colors and bold, angular lines adds to the abstract quality of the artwork.\n\n5. **Abstract Representation**: The figures are depicted in a highly abstract manner, with simplified forms and minimal detail, focusing more on the structure and composition rather than realistic representation.\n\nThese stylistic features are indicative of the Cubist movement and suggest that the artist is likely associated with this school of art.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
