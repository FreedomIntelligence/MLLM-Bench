    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo improve the quality of the image, you can consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Lighting**: Ensure that the image is well-lit, especially in the foreground and background. Adequate lighting can help to reveal more details and enhance the overall visual appeal.\n\n2. **Composition**: Pay attention to the composition of the image. Ensure that the main subject (the house) is well-framed and that the background does not distract from the main focus.\n\n3. **Focus**: Make sure that the image is in focus. A slightly blurred image can detract from the quality, so focus on capturing sharp details.\n\n4. **Noise Reduction**: If the image has a lot of noise, consider using noise reduction techniques in post-processing to improve the clarity and smoothness of the image.\n\n5. **Post-Processing**: Use image editing software to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color balance. This can help to enhance the overall appearance of the image.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, you can improve the quality of the image and make it more visually appealing.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
