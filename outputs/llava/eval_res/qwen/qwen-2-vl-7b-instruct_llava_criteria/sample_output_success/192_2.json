    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**CT Brain Scan Report**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Patient Name: [Patient Name]\n- Date of Examination: [Date]\n- Referring Physician: [Physician Name]\n- Examination Purpose: [Purpose of the examination]\n\n**Imaging Modality:**\n- Modality: Computed Tomography (CT) Scan\n\n**Findings:**\n- The axial CT image of the brain shows a well-defined, hyperdense lesion located in the left parietal lobe.\n- The lesion appears to be a mass effect, causing mild compression of the surrounding brain tissue.\n- There is no significant intracranial hemorrhage or subdural collection visible.\n- The surrounding brain parenchyma appears normal without any evidence of edema or mass effect.\n- The ventricles appear of normal size and shape, without signs of hydrocephalus.\n- The bone windows show no evidence of bony fractures or intracranial foreign bodies.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n- The hyperdense lesion in the left parietal lobe suggests a possible acute hemorrhage, such as a ruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or a cerebral aneurysm.\n- Further imaging, such as MRI or angiography, may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the lesion.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The patient should be referred to a neurologist or neurosurgeon for further evaluation and management.\n- Consideration for immediate neurovascular imaging (angiography) may be necessary to rule out an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.\n- Neurosurgical consultation is recommended for potential intervention.\n\n**References:**\n- [CT Scan Interpretation Guidelines]\n- [Neurovascular Imaging Protocols]\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n- No significant abnormalities in the other regions of the brain or skull.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe CT scan demonstrates a hyperdense lesion in the left parietal lobe, which may represent an acute hemorrhage. Further imaging is recommended to determine the exact nature of the lesion and plan appropriate treatment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
