    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the image and identify visual cues that suggest the nutritional differences between each hamburger.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image consists of four different hamburgers, each having distinct ingredients and toppings. The visual cues that indicate the nutritional differences among these hamburgers include the choice of meat, the variety of toppings, and the type of cheese used. \n\nIt can be observed that one of the hamburgers contains only meat and lettuce, making it a leaner option compared to the other hamburgers that have additional toppings like tomatoes, onions, and cheese. The variations in toppings and ingredients suggest that these hamburgers provide different nutritional profiles, depending on personal preferences and dietary needs.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows four different hamburgers, each with distinct ingredients that suggest different nutritional profiles:\n\n1. **Top Left Burger**:\n   - **Meat**: Ground beef\n   - **Protein**: High\n   - **Carbohydrates**: Moderate from the bun\n   - **Fat**: Moderate from the meat and cheese\n   - **Sodium**: Moderate from the cheese and bacon\n   - **Vitamins and Minerals**: Low, except for some from the vegetables\n\n2. **Top Right Burger**:\n   - **Meat**: Fried chicken\n   - **Protein**: High from the chicken\n   - **Carbohydrates**: Moderate from the bun\n   - **Fat**: High from the chicken and cheese\n   - **Sodium**: High from the chicken coating and cheese\n   - **Vitamins and Minerals**: Low, except for some from the vegetables\n\n3. **Bottom Left Sandwich**:\n   - **Meat**: Chicken\n   - **Protein**: High from the chicken\n   - **Carbohydrates**: Moderate from the bread\n   - **Fat**: Moderate from the chicken and cheese\n   - **Sodium**: Moderate from the chicken and cheese\n   - **Vitamins and Minerals**: Low, except for some from the vegetables\n\n4. **Bottom Right Burger**:\n   - **Meat**: Ground beef\n   - **Protein**: High from the meat\n   - **Carbohydrates**: High from the bun\n   - **Fat**: High from the meat and cheese\n   - **Sodium**: Moderate from the cheese\n   - **Vitamins and Minerals**: Low, except for some from the vegetables\n\nEach burger has a different combination of ingredients, which affects its overall nutritional profile.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify ingredients in each hamburger that affect nutritional content, such as meat type and toppings.\n2. Compare visual size and thickness of patties and buns among the hamburgers.\n3. Note presence of additional elements like sauces or cheese that imply caloric differences.",
