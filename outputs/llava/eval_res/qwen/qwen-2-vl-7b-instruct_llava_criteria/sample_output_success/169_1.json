    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image provides a set of step-by-step instructions for opening a new book. Here is a detailed description of the steps:\n\n1. Place the book with its back on a table.\n2. Let the front cover down.\n3. Then the back cover.\n4. Then open a few leaves in front.\n5. Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached.\n\nThe instructions are clear and easy to follow. They provide a logical sequence of actions that guide the user through the process of opening the book. The use of simple language and clear illustrations makes it easy for anyone to understand and follow the steps.\n\nThe effectiveness of the instructions is high. By following these steps, the user can properly open the book without causing damage to the binding or the leaves. The instructions also emphasize the importance of gentle treatment, which is crucial for maintaining the book's condition.\n\nOverall, the instructions are concise, clear, and effective. They provide a step-by-step guide that anyone can follow to properly open a new book.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
