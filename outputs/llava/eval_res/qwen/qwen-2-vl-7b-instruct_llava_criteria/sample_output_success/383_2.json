    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the skater boy is captured mid-air over a concrete skate park. Given the context and the skill level implied by the image, the skater boy is likely performing a trick that involves landing back on the skateboard after a jump.\n\n**Next Move Prediction:**\nThe skater boy will likely land back on the skateboard after completing the jump. This is a common maneuver in skateboarding, often referred to as a \"jump and grab\" or \"ollie to grab.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe risk of this action is moderate. Skateboarding tricks, especially those involving jumps and grabs, can be challenging and potentially dangerous. The risk factors include:\n1. **Landing**: Successfully landing back on the skateboard is crucial to avoid injury.\n2. **Balance**: Maintaining balance during the jump and landing is essential to prevent falls.\n3. **Skill Level**: The skater's skill level affects the risk. Novice skaters may be more prone to errors and injuries.\n\nTo mitigate the risk, the skater should:\n- Practice the trick multiple times to build confidence.\n- Ensure the skateboard is in good condition.\n- Wear appropriate safety gear, such as a helmet and pads.\n- Skate on a well-maintained skate park with proper lighting.\n\nOverall, with proper preparation and practice, the risk of injury can be significantly reduced.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
