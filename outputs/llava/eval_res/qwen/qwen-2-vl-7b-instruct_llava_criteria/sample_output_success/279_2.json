    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyzing the pairwise relationships between all characters in the diagram.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows three people standing in front of a turquoise background. They are all holding up cardboard cutouts of cartoon animal faces. The cutouts are of different animals, including a brown cow, a black and white zebra, and a pink pig. The person on the left is a boy wearing a light blue shirt and jeans. The person in the middle is a woman wearing a grey sweater and black pants. The person on the right is a girl wearing a pink sequined top and a colorful tutu skirt. They all appear to be enjoying a fun, playful moment together.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, three people are standing together, possibly celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. The woman and two kids are holding up cow-shaped and possibly horse-shaped hats, which could be part of a party theme or decoration. The pairwise relationships between the characters are as follows:\n\n1. The woman is standing in the middle.\n2. The two kids are on either side of her, with one on her left and the other on her right.\n\nThese three people create a cohesive group, likely enjoying a fun and memorable event together.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
