    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe exercise in the image is the bench press.\n\n**Technical Essentials of the Bench Press:**\n\n1. **Positioning:**\n   - Lie down on a bench with your back flat and your feet firmly on the ground.\n   - Position the barbell directly above your chest, with your arms slightly bent and palms facing down (or neutral grip).\n\n2. **Grasp:**\n   - Hold the barbell with a comfortable grip width. A common width is about shoulder-width apart.\n   - Your grip should be firm enough to prevent the bar from slipping, but not so tight as to cause discomfort.\n\n3. **Movement:**\n   - Press the barbell up until your arms are fully extended, with your elbows slightly bent.\n   - Keep your shoulders back and your core engaged to maintain stability.\n   - Lower the barbell to the chest, keeping your elbows tucked in and your forearms parallel to the ground.\n   - Repeat the movement.\n\n4. **Breathing:**\n   - Inhale as you lower the barbell.\n   - Exhale as you press the barbell up.\n\n5. **Safety:**\n   - Use a spotter if possible to assist in case of failure.\n   - Keep your head and neck aligned with your spine throughout the movement.\n   - Avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement to prevent injury.\n\nThe bench press is a fundamental compound exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps, and is often used as a foundational strength training exercise. It can be performed with various types of bars (e.g., Olympic, Smith machine) and can be modified with different grips (e.g., close grip, wide grip) and angles (e.g., flat, incline, decline).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
