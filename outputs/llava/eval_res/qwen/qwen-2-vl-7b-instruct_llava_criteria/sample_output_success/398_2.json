    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a series of figures in chronological order. What is the trend of change in the predicted graph? Explain the reasons for this trend of change.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph shows a gradual increase in the number of figures with obesity over time. Here are the reasons for this trend:\n\n1. **Increased Sedentary Lifestyle**: In the modern world, there has been a significant shift towards a more sedentary lifestyle. People spend more time sitting, either at work or while watching TV, which can lead to weight gain.\n\n2. **Unhealthy Eating Habits**: The availability of processed and high-calorie foods has increased, and people often consume more calories than they need. This can lead to weight gain, especially if combined with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n3. **Genetic Predisposition**: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to obesity, which can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n4. **Environmental Factors**: The built environment, such as the lack of parks and green spaces, can make it harder for people to engage in physical activity. Additionally, the availability of fast food and convenience stores can make it easier to consume unhealthy foods.\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**: Stress, anxiety, and depression can all contribute to weight gain. People may turn to food as a coping mechanism, leading to increased calorie intake and weight gain.\n\n6. **Lack of Physical Activity**: With the rise of technology, people often use electronic devices instead of engaging in physical activities. This can lead to a decrease in physical activity levels, which is a major contributor to obesity.\n\n7. **Economic Factors**: In some cases, obesity can be linked to economic factors, such as the cost of healthy food or the availability of affordable, unhealthy options.\n\nThese factors combined have led to a significant increase in obesity rates worldwide, as depicted in the graph.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph is that the waistline of the figures gradually increases from one figure to the next. This represents the accumulation of extra fat over time, which is a common concern in the context of obesity. The series of figures, each showing a person wearing blue shorts and a spaghetti-string top, are used to explain the consequences of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in obesity and its related health problems. This sequence is a visual representation of the potential health risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer recognizes the trend of increasing body weight.\n2. Assess the explanation for the rising trend, relating to the figures' changes.\n3. Confirm the answer follows a chronological analysis of the figures.",
