    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe vehicles in the image are currently traveling on a snowy road, with the headlights illuminating the road ahead. The white car is in the foreground, and the blue car is to its right. The white car appears to be moving straight ahead, while the blue car is turning to the right.\n\nTo avoid collision in the next few seconds, drivers should:\n\n1. **Maintain a safe distance:** Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front to allow for stopping in case of sudden braking.\n2. **Use appropriate speed:** Reduce speed to match the conditions and the speed of the vehicle in front.\n3. **Be prepared to stop:** Be ready to stop suddenly if the vehicle in front slows down or stops.\n4. **Use headlights:** Ensure that headlights are on to increase visibility.\n5. **Stay alert:** Pay close attention to the road and other vehicles, and be ready to react to any changes in traffic conditions.\n\nBy following these guidelines, drivers can help ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
