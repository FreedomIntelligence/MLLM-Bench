    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend prediction image, determine the trend shown in the image is reasonable.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the evolution of chickens over several years, with a more recent prediction for the year 2025. The trend depicted in the image is not reasonable. Chickens are not expected to evolve into dinosaurs, and the transformation shown in the image is purely fictional and not based on any scientific evidence or biological evolution. The trend prediction in the image is not supported by any credible scientific research or data.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the size of chickens over time. The image features a graph with several chicken sizes, including an oversized chicken, dinosaurs, and a rooster that has impregnated a dinosaur. The trend is presented in a humorous and exaggerated manner, showing chickens growing in size to become like dinosaurs.\n\nThe trend is likely a fantasy or a parody, as it is unrealistic for chickens to grow to the size of dinosaurs in actuality. The graph and the rooster impregnating a dinosaur are not scientifically plausible, and therefore, the trend is not reasonable. The image is meant to be humorous and entertaining, rather than providing accurate information about the growth of chickens over time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the answer identifies the trend as unreasonable.\n2. Assess the logical explanation for why the trend is unreasonable.\n3. Evaluate the consistency of the answer with the image's content.",
