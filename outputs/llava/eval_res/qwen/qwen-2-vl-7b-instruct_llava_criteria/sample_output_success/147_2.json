    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in this meme is derived from the contrast between the dog's actual appearance and its portrayed image. The dog is dressed in a suit, which is a humorous contrast to its typical casual appearance. The backstory could be as follows:\n\nOnce upon a time, the dog's owner decided to spoil their beloved pet with a fancy gift. They commissioned a custom portrait of the dog dressed in a suit, complete with a bow tie. The owner was so proud of the finished product that they hung it on the wall for everyone to see.\n\nHowever, when payday arrived, the owner couldn't resist splurging on unnecessary items for themselves. The dog, feeling a bit neglected, decided to take matters into its own paws. It snuck into the owner's closet and found a suit that fit perfectly. With a wag of its tail, the dog put on the suit and posed for a picture, striking the same pose as the portrait on the wall.\n\nThe owner, upon seeing the picture, couldn't help but laugh at the irony. The dog, dressed in a suit, looked just like the portrait, and the owner realized that sometimes the best gifts are the ones that come from within.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
