    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is a table, and you need to implement data visualization based on the data in the table, in order to present the data in the table in the best way.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo implement data visualization based on the data in the table, you can use various types of charts and graphs that are effective for displaying percentage data over time. Here are some suggestions for visualizations:\n\n1. **Bar Chart**: Use a horizontal bar chart to compare the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state across the different Finance Commissions. This will allow you to easily see the changes in allocation for each state over time.\n\n2. **Stacked Bar Chart**: Create a stacked bar chart to show the overall trend of union taxes and duties allocated to all states combined, with each Finance Commission represented as a separate bar. This will help in understanding the total trend and how it changes over time.\n\n3. **Line Chart**: Use a line chart to show the percentage share of each state over time. This will help in visualizing the trend for each state and how it compares to others.\n\n4. **Heat Map**: Create a heat map to show the percentage share of union taxes and duties for each state over the different Finance Commissions. This will help in quickly identifying which states have received the highest and lowest shares over time.\n\n5. **Treemap**: Use a treemap to display the percentage share of each state over the different Finance Commissions. This will help in visualizing the allocation in a hierarchical structure, which can be useful for understanding the relative shares.\n\n6. **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between the percentage share of union taxes and duties and the Finance Commission number. This can help in identifying any trends or patterns in the data.\n\n7. **Gantt Chart**: If you want to focus on the timeline aspect, a Gantt chart can be used to show the percentage share of union taxes and duties for each state over the different Finance Commissions.\n\nChoose the visualization that best suits the data and the insights you want to communicate. For example, if you want to compare the shares across states, a bar chart or a stacked bar chart might be the best choice. If you want to see the trend over time, a line chart or a heat map would be more appropriate.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs the image features a table with a list of different states in India, one potential data visualization approach is to create a bar chart or a line graph that displays the population of each state over time. This can help showcase changes in population growth and trends across the states, and highlight any particularly fast-growing or slow-growing areas.\n\nTo implement this approach, you can use a data visualization tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a specialized data visualization application. Start by sorting the table by the population column or selecting the columns that show the population figures for each state. Then, create a bar chart or a line graph with the population data on the vertical axis and the state names on the horizontal axis.\n\nFurthermore, you can consider adding color-coding to the chart based on the state's region, such as North, South, East, or West, to make it easier to identify trends within specific geographic areas. Finally, you can add labels and legends to the chart for better clarity and understanding of the data. With these visualization techniques, you can effectively present the data in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Visualize data trends across Finance Commissions for multiple states.\n2. Highlight top three states with the highest percentage share changes.\n3. Ensure visualization clarity for comparison between states and years.",
