    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical characteristics that are typical for the species and breeds of the animals in the image, such as coat type and ear shape\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features three puppies and a kitten, showcasing a mix of species and breeds. The puppies present in the image can be characterized by their furry coats and dog-like features, such as pointy ears and a muzzle. The cat, on the other hand, is characterized by its sleek, furry coat, large pointy ears, and, of course, a more elongated body. The ears of the dogs are pointed upwards, which is a typical characteristic of many dog breeds, whereas the cat has large, pointed ears, which is a more cat-like feature. By comparing these physical characteristics, one can appreciate the differences between the animals and their respective species and breeds.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features three young animals: a dog, a cat, and another dog. Here are the typical physical characteristics for each species and breed:\n\n1. **Dog (on the left)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: Short and smooth, with a white coat and brown patches on the face and ears.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Small and pointed.\n\n2. **Cat (in the middle)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: Long and fluffy, with a golden-brown coat.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Large and pointed, often with tufts of hair at the tips.\n\n3. **Dog (on the right)**:\n   - **Coat Type**: Short and smooth, with a light beige coat.\n   - **Ear Shape**: Small and pointed.\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Coat Type**: The dog on the left has a short, smooth coat, while the cat has a long, fluffy coat. The dog on the right also has a short, smooth coat.\n- **Ear Shape**: All three animals have small, pointed ears, which is typical for many dog breeds and cats. The cat's ears are particularly large and pointed.\n\nThese characteristics are generally consistent with what is typical for dogs and cats. The long, fluffy coat is more common in cats, especially in breeds like Maine Coons, while the short, smooth coat is more typical of many dog breeds.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare coat types: smooth white with tan patches, fluffy long-haired, soft short cream-colored.\n2. Compare ear shapes: partially folded, pointed and floppy.",
