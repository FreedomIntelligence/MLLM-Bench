    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe subjects in the image appear to be participating in a formal or ceremonial setting, possibly related to traditional or cultural attire.

This suggests that the setting or event is of cultural importance.\n\n4. **Background:**\n   - The background features a large, ornate decoration with a crescent moon and stylized dragon heads, which adds to the ceremonial or formal ambiance of the setting.\n\nOverall, the subjects seem to be in a positive and respectful mood, likely participating in a culturally significant event or ceremony.
