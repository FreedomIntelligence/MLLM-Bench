    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the color, shape and other attribute you think would be useful for people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a beautiful, multicolored plant with vibrant green and yellow leaves. The plant exhibits an interesting and colorful flower pattern, making it a striking and attractive feature in the garden. The plant's bright leaves and blooms create an eye-catching and lively effect, adding a unique touch of natural beauty to the garden.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe plant in the picture is a Hosta, specifically a cultivar with variegated leaves. Here are the key attributes to recognize it:\n\n1. **Color**: The leaves are primarily green with yellow and white variegation. The yellow and white variegation is most prominent on the outer edges of the leaves, creating a striking contrast.\n\n2. **Shape**: The leaves are broad and lanceolate (sword-shaped), with a slightly rounded tip. They are arranged in a rosette pattern, with the leaves tightly clustered at the center.\n\n3. **Texture**: The leaves appear to be thick and fleshy, typical of Hosta plants.\n\n4. **Size**: The leaves are relatively large, with some reaching a significant size, indicating that this is a mature plant.\n\n5. **Position**: The plant is growing in a garden bed with mulch around it, which is typical for Hosta plants to help retain moisture and suppress weeds.\n\nThese attributes make the variegated Hosta easily recognizable and distinguishable from other plants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the plant as Hosta.\n 2. Describe the shape, color, and arrangement of the plant's leaves.\n3. Mention any additional attributes that aid recognition (e.g., environment, leaf pattern).",
