    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nObserve debris-clearing methods and safety gear to gauge rescue safety and efficiency.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a scene of destruction and aftermath, likely following a disaster such as a fire or a natural calamity. The area is filled with debris, including broken metal, wood, and other materials, indicating extensive damage. A person is visible amidst the rubble, suggesting that rescue efforts are ongoing. The presence of rescue workers and equipment is crucial in such situations to ensure safety and efficiency. Safety gear, including helmets, masks, and protective clothing, should be used by all rescue personnel to protect them from hazards such as sharp edges, dust, and potential secondary accidents. Clearing debris in a methodical and organized manner is essential to avoid entanglement and to ensure that all survivors are accounted for.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image presents a scene of a child standing amidst a pile of rubble in a city, possibly after a natural disaster or a collapsing structure. In the process of clearing debris, several people can be seen, including one person standing in the middle and others surrounding the pile. However, we cannot easily identify any specific safety gear or debris-clearing methods being used.\n\nThe presence of the child and people around the pile indicates a sense of urgency and concern for the safety of those involved in the rescue efforts. To better understand the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation, one would want to observe the use of safety gear, such as helmets and protective clothing, and the implementation of proper debris-clearing methods, such as the use of specialized equipment or the organization of a coordinated rescue team.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible safety gear worn by individuals in the image.\n2. Describe observable debris-clearing methods or equipment.\n3. Assess the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation depicted.",
