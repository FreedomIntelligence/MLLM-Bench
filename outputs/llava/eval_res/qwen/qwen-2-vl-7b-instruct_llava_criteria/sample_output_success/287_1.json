Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBy integrating the expressions, actions, and attire of the characters in the image, could you please speculate on the likely age group to which they belong?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe group of people in the image are young, and they appear to be of high school age.

The joyous expressions and celebratory actions, such as waving diplomas and throwing confetti, suggest that they are likely young adults, possibly in their late teens to early twenties.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
