    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSolve the problem in the image and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe problem states the following:\n\n- At 9:00, there were 5 people at the zoo.\n- At 11:00, 4 more people came.\n- At noon, 7 more people came.\n\nWe need to find the total number of people at the zoo now.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. At 9:00, there were 5 people.\n2. At 11:00, 4 more people came, so the total number of people became \\( 5 + 4 = 9 \\).\n3. At noon, 7 more people came, so the total number of people became \\( 9 + 7 = 16 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of people at the zoo now is 16.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a piece of paper with handwritten text describing the movements of people at a zoo. It appears to be a timeline or a summary of people's visits to the zoo. The paper contains several times, such as 11:30 and 7:30, along with numbers of people visiting at these times. Additionally, there is a question at the end of the text that appears to be related to the overall content. Based on the information available, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation without additional context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly transcribe the handwritten text, including numbers and words.\n2. Accurately solve the arithmetic problem presented in the text, whose answer is 16.\n3. Provide a clear explanation of the steps taken to reach the solution.",
