    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the two individuals smiling at each other?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the two individuals are likely colleagues or acquaintances, possibly attending a professional event or conference. The presence of a laptop and a name badge on the table suggests that they might be discussing work-related matters or sharing a light moment during a break.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nGiven the presence of a white table with laptops behind the two men, it is likely that they have a professional relationship, possibly as colleagues or business partners. They could be collaborating on a project, discussing work matters or sharing ideas. The friendly exchange of smiles suggests a level of comfort and trust between them, which is common in professional contexts where individuals work or engage in business interactions together.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential relationship based on social cues (clothing, gestures, context).\n2. Justify relationship inference with visual elements (interaction, environment).",
