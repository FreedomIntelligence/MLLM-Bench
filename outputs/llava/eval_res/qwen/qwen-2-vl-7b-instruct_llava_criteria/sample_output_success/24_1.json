    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the swimming stroke being used by examining the position of the swimmer's hands and head.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the swimmer is in the process of taking a stroke while swimming in the water. He is wearing glasses and a white cap. His left arm is extended, and his head is positioned to the side, which suggests that he is using a breaststroke technique to swim. The breaststroke is a swimming stroke where swimmers use their arms and chest muscles to propel themselves through the water in a pattern resembling a breaststroke motion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe swimmer in the image is performing the butterfly stroke. This can be identified by the position of the swimmer's arms and head. In the butterfly stroke, the swimmer's arms are extended forward with the palms facing downward and the head is lifted out of the water, creating a synchronized movement of the arms and body.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the swimmer's hands move simultaneously with wingspan-like motion (butterfly stroke).\n2. Confirm the swimmer's head position aligns with butterfly stroke technique (facing down).\n3. Evaluate the synchronicity of hand and head movement indicative of butterfly stroke.",
