    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotional exchange occurring between the individuals by considering their hand gestures, facial expressions, and the proximity to one another.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the man and the woman are facing each other, engaged in a heated exchange. The woman is pointing her finger at the man, which often signifies a direct, assertive, or even confrontational tone in their conversation. Meanwhile, the man is smiling, which may indicate that he is either enjoying the interaction, trying to diffuse the situation, or simply being playful. The close proximity of the individuals further emphasizes the intensity of their emotional exchange. Overall, the scene suggests a lively and potentially tension-filled conversation between the two people.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe emotional exchange between the individuals in the image appears to be intense and confrontational. Here are the key observations:\n\n1. **Hand Gestures**: The woman is pointing her finger upwards, which can be interpreted as a gesture of accusation or confrontation. Her hand is raised, indicating a sense of urgency or emphasis in her communication. The man's hand is not clearly visible, but his body language suggests he is engaged in the interaction.\n\n2. **Facial Expressions**: Both individuals have their mouths open wide, which is often associated with shouting or yelling. The woman's expression appears to be one of anger or frustration, while the man's expression is less clear but seems to be focused and intense.\n\n3. **Proximity**: The two individuals are standing very close to each other, which can indicate a high level of emotional intensity or urgency in their communication. The close proximity suggests that they are engaged in a direct and possibly heated exchange.\n\nOverall, the combination of these elements suggests that the individuals are experiencing a strong emotional exchange, likely involving anger, frustration, or disagreement. The use of hand gestures and close proximity indicates that they are actively communicating and emphasizing their points.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by both individuals' facial expressions and hand gestures as angry.\n2. Describe the nature of the emotional exchange based on proximity and body language.",
