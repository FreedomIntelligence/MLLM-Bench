    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere could be several circumstances that led to the person lying on the floor in the public corridor surrounded by papers. Some possible reasons include:\n\n1. **Slip and Fall Accident**: The person might have slipped on a wet or uneven surface, causing them to fall and lie on the floor.\n\n2. **Medical Emergency**: The person might have experienced a medical emergency, such as a fainting spell or a sudden illness, leading them to collapse on the floor.\n\n3. **Accidental Drop**: The person might have been carrying papers and accidentally dropped them, causing them to fall to the floor.\n\n4. **Falling Object**: A heavy object might have fallen from above, causing the person to fall and lie on the floor.\n\n5. **Fatigue or Dizziness**: The person might have been feeling tired or dizzy and fell to the floor.\n\n6. **External Injury**: The person might have been involved in an external event, such as a fall or an accident, that caused them to lie on the floor.\n\n7. **Psychological Distress**: The person might be experiencing a psychological crisis or distress, leading them to lie on the floor.\n\n8. **Environmental Hazards**: The corridor might have been affected by environmental hazards, such as a spill or a tripping hazard, causing the person to fall.\n\nWithout additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the person lying on the floor.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
