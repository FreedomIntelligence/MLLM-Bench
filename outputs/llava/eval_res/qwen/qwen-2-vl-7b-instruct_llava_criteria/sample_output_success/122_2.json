    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the possible emotional dynamics of the coupleâ€™s interaction based on their seating posture and orientation towards each other.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe couple's interaction in the image appears to be filled with joy and affection. The man is giving the woman a piggyback ride, which suggests a playful and lighthearted moment. The woman's wide smile and open mouth, along with her leaning in for a kiss, indicate that she is feeling very happy and close to the man. The man's smile and the way he is holding the woman also show that he is enjoying the moment and is affectionate towards her. The overall posture and orientation of the couple, with their faces close together and the woman's arm around the man, suggest a strong bond and a deep connection between them. The setting, which appears to be outdoors with a natural backdrop, adds to the romantic and cheerful atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the man is holding the woman in his arms while she is smiling. The woman is sitting on the man's shoulders with pink flowers in her hand. The couple's interaction suggests a sense of joy, closeness, and affection between them. Their seating posture and orientation towards each other indicate a playful and intimate connection, possibly indicating that they are enjoying a special moment together, such as a romantic outing, a celebration, or simply spending quality time with one another.
