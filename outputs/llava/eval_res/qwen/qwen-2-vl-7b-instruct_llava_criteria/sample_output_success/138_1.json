    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts three individuals engaged in what appears to be a mining activity. The central figure is using a pickaxe, which is a tool typically used for breaking up hard rocks or earth. The other two figures are seated and appear to be handling smaller tools, possibly shovels or picks, which are also common in mining operations.\n\nBased on these observations, it is likely that the individuals are miners or construction workers involved in excavation or mining activities. The presence of the pickaxe and the posture of the central figure suggest that they are engaged in manual labor, possibly extracting minerals or rocks from the ground.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
