    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of mushroom is it in the image? Is it edible?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a group of white mushrooms growing on top of a rock. It is not possible to definitively determine if these mushrooms are edible or not just based on the image. However, a proper identification could be done if more characteristics like the mushroom's shape, texture, and presence of any gills or pores were visible. Generally, it is advisable to avoid consuming wild mushrooms without proper identification due to the risk of consuming toxic or harmful species.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe mushroom in the image is a type of agaric. Agarics are a group of mushrooms that are typically found in forests and woodlands. They are characterized by their large, white caps and gills underneath the cap. Agarics are generally considered to be safe to eat, but it is important to note that some species can be poisonous, so it is always a good idea to be cautious when handling wild mushrooms. If you are not sure whether a mushroom is safe to eat, it is best to consult with a mycologist or a qualified expert.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify mushroom as \"galerina marginata.\"\n2. State the mushroom is not edible.\n3. Ensure the answer is based on visual characteristics of the mushroom in the image.",
