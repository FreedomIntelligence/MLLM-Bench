    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the event in the image and classify the cultural significance of event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe event in the image is a bullfight, which is a traditional spectacle in some cultures, particularly in Spain, Mexico, and other Latin American countries. Bullfights involve a matador (a skilled bullfighter) using capes and sticks to entice a bull into a series of maneuvers, culminating in the bull being killed or injured to the point of incapacitation.\n\nThe cultural significance of bullfights varies across different regions and societies. In some cultures, bullfights are seen as a form of entertainment, showcasing the skill and bravery of the matadors. However, they are also criticized by animal rights groups for the mistreatment and suffering inflicted upon the bulls. The image itself does not provide information about the ethical considerations or the stance of the individuals involved in the bullfight, but it does highlight the traditional attire and the interaction between the matadors and the bull.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays a bullfighting event where a man is holding a pink cape, and another man is holding a red cloth. Bullfighting is a traditional spectacle that originated in Spain and later spread to other countries. It primarily involves a matador handling a bull using a cape and a sword. The event has cultural significance as it often represents courage, strength, and skill on the part of the matador. The specific colors of the cape (pink) and the cloth (red) in the image add to the visual appeal and symbolism of this traditional spectacle.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as bullfighting and mention its cultural significance.\n2. Describe the scene accurately, including attire, personnel and actions.",
