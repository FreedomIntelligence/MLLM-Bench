    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nwhat are the cooking methods that turn the food in the image from ingredients to dishes?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the food is being prepared through a combination of grilling and roasting methods. The sandwiches and meats are placed on a grill, and it appears that they are being cooked or grilled to achieve the right texture, browning, and flavor. The cooking process involves high heat from the grill, which causes the surfaces of the food to cook evenly, creating a desirable crust and enhancing their overall taste. Additionally, there are water bottles in the scene, suggesting that they may be used to keep the grill clean, cool, and hydrated during the cooking process.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe cooking methods that turn the ingredients in the image into dishes include:\n\n1. **Grilling**: The skewers of meat in the image are grilled, which involves cooking the meat over an open flame or heat source to achieve a charred exterior and a tender interior.\n\n2. **Frying**: The bread buns and possibly other items on the tray are likely fried. Frying involves submerging the food in hot oil, which can be used to cook a variety of dishes, including bread and meat.\n\n3. **Toasting**: The bread buns are likely toasted, which involves heating them to a warm, soft, and slightly crispy state. This can be done by placing them in an oven or toaster.\n\nThese methods are commonly used in street food preparation to create a variety of dishes that are both tasty and visually appealing.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible foods: fried chicken, grilled skewers, stuffed sandwiches.\n2. Describe the cooking methods for these foods and transformation from raw ingredients to the final dish.\n3. Mention the use of heat and any visible seasoning or coating.",
