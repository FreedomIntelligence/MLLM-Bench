Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCapture the city's night life, the interplay of darkness and lights, and the tranquil urban mood by the water in a poem.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the dark city night,  \nTall buildings stand illuminated,  \nGlowing with golden lights,  \nLike a starry sky above.\n\nThe ocean wind, it howls and sighs,  \nA melancholic tune that resonates,  \nAs the waves crash on the shore,  \nAnd the world falls into a state of slumber.\n\nAmidst this serene scene,  \nThe city's lights shine bright,  \nIntermingling with the darkness,  \nA dance of contrast and harmony in night.\n\nThe buildings, they seem to rise,  \nDefying the laws of gravity,  \nA testament to the urban dream,  \nA world of possibilities and aspirations.\n\nAnd yet, as the night unfolds,  \nThe cityscape takes a backseat,  \nAs the gentle lapping of the ocean waves,  \nEchoes the heartbeat of the city's rest.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the stillness of the night,\nWhere stars and lights converge,\nThe city breathes a silent sigh,\nAs life's rhythm gently swerves.\n\nThe darkness cloaks the sky,\nIn hues of deep blue and black,\nYet, in the void, a spectacle,\nOf lights that light up the walk.\n\nThe buildings stand like sentinels,\nIlluminated, proud, and tall,\nTheir windows twinkle like jewels,\nReflecting the world's small.\n\nThe water, calm and serene,\nMirrors the city's face,\nA tranquil dance of light and shadow,\nIn a symphony of grace.\n\nPeople gather by the shore,\nLost in thoughts, lost in time,\nThe night's embrace is peaceful,\nA moment of still and prime.\n\nSo, in this city's night life,\nWhere darkness meets the light,\nThe urban mood is captured,\nIn a moment, so bright.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem reflects contrast between city lights and night darkness, capturing the urban atmosphere.\n2. Includes elements of tranquil mood by the water, suggesting peacefulness amidst city life.\n3.
