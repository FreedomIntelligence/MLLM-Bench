    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the visual symptoms in detail and estimate the stage of the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a close-up of a child with a noticeable rash on the cheeks. The rash appears as red, raised, and inflamed areas, which are characteristic of a skin condition known as eczema. The rash is widespread and covers a significant portion of the cheeks.\n\nTo estimate the stage of the condition, we can consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Intensity and Distribution**: The rash is widespread and appears to be quite intense, which might suggest that the condition is in a more active or severe stage.\n2. **Duration**: The presence of such a rash for a prolonged period can indicate that the child has had eczema for some time, possibly several weeks or months.\n3. **Severity**: The size and number of the rash spots suggest that the condition is not in its mildest form. It is likely to be in a moderate to severe stage.\n\nBased on these observations, it is reasonable to estimate that the child's eczema is in a moderate to severe stage. Treatment may be necessary to manage the symptoms and prevent further flare-ups.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a young child is looking at the camera with red spots on their skin, particularly on their face. These red spots are likely indicative of a rash or an outbreak of hives. Hives are often caused by an allergic reaction, irritation, or an infection. It is difficult to precisely determine the stage of the condition from the image alone, as the severity, size, and distribution of the rash can vary. However, given that the child is looking at the camera, it is possible that the rash is not too severe or extensive, allowing the child to maintain focus and comfort in the presence of the photographer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe visible skin symptoms (e.g., rash, discoloration).\n2. Estimate condition stage based on visual symptoms severity.\n3. Include no diagnosis, focus on symptom description and stage estimation.",
