    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the mood and possible reflections of the character in the painting, considering the symbolism of the cloth, background and the objects he looks at.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe painting depicts an elderly man in a contemplative pose, sitting on a rock or a ledge. The mood of the painting is one of deep thought and introspection. The man appears to be lost in his own thoughts, perhaps reflecting on his life or contemplating the future.\n\nSymbolically, the cloth he is wearing could represent his status or role, as it appears to be a robe or garment of some significance. The background, which is dark and somewhat abstract, may symbolize the complexity and depth of his thoughts. The objects he looks at, such as the book or scrolls, suggest that he is engaged in intellectual or spiritual reflection.\n\nOverall, the painting conveys a sense of quiet introspection and a deep engagement with the mysteries of life. The man's posture and the objects he is looking at suggest that he is a person of some importance or wisdom, and that he is deeply engaged in the process of understanding himself and the world around him.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the painting, the bearded man with a long white beard is sitting down and looking into a mirror. He is dressed in a long blue robe, which suggests a sense of wisdom or spirituality. The background features a cave and some rocks, evoking a feeling of introspection or contemplation. The cloth and the presence of a book near the man further indicate a connection to knowledge and possibly a deeper understanding of life. The man seems to be reflecting on his spiritual journey or contemplating life's lessons, as he seems to be absorbed in thought or prayer. The man's age and beard also add to the overall impression of experience and wisdom. Overall, the image portrays a contemplative and thoughtful mood, with the man seemingly seeking insight or guidance through introspection and reflection.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the character's mood, considering posture, facial expression, and lighting.\n2. Analyze symbolism of the cloth and background in relation to the character's mood.",
