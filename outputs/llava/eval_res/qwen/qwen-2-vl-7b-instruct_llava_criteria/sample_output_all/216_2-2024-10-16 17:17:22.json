    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide insights into how the data presented in the image could be indicative of the economic dynamics within the Islamic financial sector.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe data in the image provides several insights into the economic dynamics within the Islamic financial sector:\n\n1. **Significant Growth**: The total financial value of the Islamic market in 2022 was $3.25 trillion USD, with the total number of issues globally reaching 1,404. This indicates a robust and expanding market, reflecting growing investor interest and financial innovation in the sector.\n\n2. **Diverse Product Mix**: The market is diverse, with both Sukuk (24%) and other financial instruments (76%) contributing to the overall value. This diversity suggests a mature market with multiple financing options available to meet different needs and preferences.\n\n3. **Regional Focus**: The MENA region accounts for 31% of the total issues by value, indicating a strong presence and significant contribution to the global Islamic market. This highlights the importance of the MENA region in driving the growth and development of the Islamic financial sector.\n\n4. **Geographical Spread**: With 69% of the issues coming from other regions, it shows that the Islamic financial market is not limited to the MENA region but is expanding globally. This broader geographical spread is indicative of the increasing globalization and internationalization of the Islamic financial sector.\n\n5. **Sukuk Dominance**: Despite the diversity of financial instruments, Sukuk remain the primary vehicle for financing in the Islamic market. This dominance suggests a strong preference for this type of financing instrument, which is structured to comply with Islamic principles.\n\n6. **Geographical Distribution**: The data on global MENA issuances by country shows Saudi Arabia leading with $42.643 billion, followed by Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait, and Egypt. This distribution highlights the significant role of these countries in the Islamic financial market, reflecting their strong economies and regulatory frameworks supporting Islamic finance.\n\nOverall, the data reflects a thriving and diversified Islamic financial sector with significant growth, global reach, and a strong preference for Sukuk. The sector's expansion and diversification indicate a robust and dynamic market that is likely to continue growing and evolving.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a bar graph showing the number of issues and financial value of the Islamic market in 2021. The Islamic market is growing rapidly, with the total number of issues being at 145 billion USD over the past year. This demonstrates the increasing interest in and demand for Islamic finance within the global financial sector. With countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and others making significant investments in this sector, it is evident that the Islamic market is becoming more prominent and influential in the global financial landscape. This implies that the Islamic financial sector is gaining acceptance and attracting more attention from investors, governments, and businesses, which will further contribute to its growth and development in the years to come.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify proportions of Sukuk and other financial instruments in Islamic market value.\n2. Compare MENA region issuances to other regions in 2022.\n3.
