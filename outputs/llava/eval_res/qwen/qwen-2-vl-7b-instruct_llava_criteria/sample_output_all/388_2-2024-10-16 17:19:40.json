    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the series of actions in the image and predict the possible next action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of diagrams illustrating different positions of a person lying on a table, with various markers indicating specific body parts. The sequence appears to depict different stages of a medical or physical examination, possibly involving measurements or observations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the positions:\n1. **T1**: The person is lying on the table with markers on the head, chest, and pelvis.\n2. **T2**: The person is lying on the table with additional markers on the upper arms and legs.\n3. **T3**: The person is lying on the table with markers on the head, chest, and pelvis, similar to T1.\n4. **T4**: The person is lying on the table with markers on the head, chest, and pelvis, similar to T1.\n5. **T5**: The person is sitting on a chair with markers on the head, chest, and pelvis.\n\nGiven this sequence, it seems the person is being measured or observed in various positions. The next action could likely be:\n6. **T6**: The person might be standing or performing a specific action, such as bending or stretching, with markers on the head, chest, and pelvis. This would complete the series of measurements or observations.\n\nThe possible next action is for the person to stand up or perform a specific movement, which would allow for further analysis or measurement of their posture and movement.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a series of actions, starting with a ball above each person or symbol. From this observation, it can be inferred that the possible next action might be the ball either falling or moving towards the person, symbol, or ball to initiate the next action of the sequence. The current actions in the image involve the interaction between the ball, persons, and symbols, suggesting that this scene might be a representation of a sports game, gymnastics, or a martial arts performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the sequence of actions leading up to the last depicted moment.\n2. Predict the next action based on the momentum and position of figures.\n3. Ensure prediction is plausible within the context of the image sequence.",
