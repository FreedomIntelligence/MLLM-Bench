    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow many identical umbrellas are there?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the first image, there are multiple umbrellas of various colors and patterns. To determine the number of identical umbrellas, we need to carefully count each one. Here is a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the different colors and patterns:**\n   - Yellow\n   - Red\n   - Green\n   - Blue\n   - Purple\n   - Orange\n   - Pink\n   - Black\n   - White\n   - Red and white stripes\n   - Red and blue stripes\n   - Green and white stripes\n\n2. **Count the umbrellas of each color and pattern:**\n   - Yellow: 4\n   - Red: 5\n   - Green: 3\n   - Blue: 3\n   - Purple: 3\n   - Orange: 2\n   - Pink: 3\n   - Black: 2\n   - White: 1\n   - Red and white stripes: 2\n   - Red and blue stripes: 2\n   - Green and white stripes: 2\n\n3. **Summarize the total number of identical umbrellas:**\n   - Yellow: 4\n   - Red: 5\n   - Green: 3\n   - Blue: 3\n   - Purple: 3\n   - Orange: 2\n   - Pink: 3\n   - Black: 2\n   - White: 1\n   - Red and white stripes: 2\n   - Red and blue stripes: 2\n   - Green and white stripes: 2\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n4 (Yellow) + 5 (Red) + 3 (Green) + 3 (Blue) + 3 (Purple) + 2 (Orange) + 3 (Pink) + 2 (Black) + 1 (White) + 2 (Red and white stripes) + 2 (Red and blue stripes) + 2 (Green and white stripes) = 31\n\nTherefore, there are 31 identical umbrellas in the first image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are two identical umbrellas in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Count of identical umbrellas must match reference: 2.\n2. Describe the pattern of the identical umbrellas.",
