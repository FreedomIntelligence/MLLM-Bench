    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the writing posture of the girl in the picture and make some suggestions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the picture has a good writing posture. Her back is straight, her head is up, and her left hand is supporting her elbow, which is a correct and comfortable writing position. This posture helps to reduce the risk of neck and back problems and promotes good writing habits. \n\nSuggestions:\n1. Continue to maintain a straight back and head position.\n2. Make sure the left hand is supporting the elbow to provide stability and prevent fatigue.\n3. Adjust the writing angle as needed to ensure that the pencil is at the correct angle to the paper.\n4. Take breaks regularly to avoid fatigue and maintain a comfortable posture.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe girl in the photo appears to have her elbow resting on the desk while writing. While this posture may provide additional support and comfort, it is not ideal for maintaining a proper and healthy writing posture. For better posture, the girl should consider adopting one of the following suggestions:\n\n1. Hold the pen or pencil in both hands and use a firm grip to minimize strain on the wrist and fingers.\n2. Place the notebook or book on a flat surface, like a desk or a lap, allowing the writing surface to be easily accessible.\n3. Keep the elbows slightly bent and maintain a relaxed, neutral position while writing.\n4. Maintain a comfortable position for the wrists and avoid bending them excessively while writing.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the girl can improve her writing posture, reduce the risk of strain or discomfort, and maintain a healthy and efficient writing experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the girl's posture is ergonomically correct for writing.\n2. Assess the angle of the girl's neck and back in relation to the desk.\n3. Suggest improvements for a healthier writing posture.",
