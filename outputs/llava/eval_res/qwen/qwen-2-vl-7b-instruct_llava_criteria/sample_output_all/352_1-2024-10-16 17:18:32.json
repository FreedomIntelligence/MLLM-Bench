    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo has been edited and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the photo has been edited to appear as though there are two cute little faux foxes playing on the side of the brick walkway. In reality, there is only one fox figure located in the grass near the wall. The second fox figure is an altered photo with the face of the fox added later to create the illusion of two foxes playing. This playful and creative editing gives the scene a whimsical and charming appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe photo has not been edited. The following points support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Consistency in Shadows and Lighting**: The shadows and lighting in the photo appear consistent and natural, indicating that the photo has not been altered.\n2. **Realistic Colors and Textures**: The colors of the objects, such as the red squirrel, the pavement, and the road, are realistic and consistent with what one would expect to see in a natural setting.\n3. **No Visible Artefacts**: There are no visible artefacts or inconsistencies that would suggest the photo has been edited, such as unnatural colors, textures, or distortions.\n\nOverall, the photo appears to be a genuine representation of a scene without any evidence of editing.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the photo is edited by identifying the added squirrel.\n2. Evaluate the explanation of how the squirrel's integration indicates editing.\n3. Assess the consistency of lighting and shadows related to the squirrel.",
