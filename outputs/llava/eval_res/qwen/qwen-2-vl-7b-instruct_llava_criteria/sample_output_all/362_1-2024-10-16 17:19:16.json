Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a winter ballad on the solitude and muffled world under snow, reflecting life's resilience in a monochrome setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the snow-covered scene, a man alone walks\nHis solitary steps echo in the crunchy ground\nSilent, muffled, the world around him hushes\nThe snow-muffled world, a monochrome landscape\n\nThe trees and buildings wear a white shroud\nBare branches stretch, reaching out frozen hands\nThe wind howls through the streets, whipped by the snow\nAs the man walks, his footprints swiftly fade away\n\nIn this frozen world, life's resilience lives on\nAmidst the white and grey, a colorless but persistent hue\nA man, though the snow may cover, continues on his way\nEmbracing the cold, the winter's melancholy song he'll sing\n\nIn the end, the snow will melt, and the world revealed\nThe man may find warmth, and perhaps, a heart to mend\nBut until then, in this solitude, he braves the cold\nA lone figure in a silent, snow-muffled world.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the hushed embrace of winter's embrace,\nWhere snowflakes dance in a silent dance,\nThe world lies still, a canvas white,\nA monochrome world, a silent sight.\n\nThe man, a solitary figure,\nTraverses the path, undeterred by the blizzard's rigor,\nA figure in the frosty frame,\nA testament to life's unyielding claim.\n\nThe snow-capped buildings stand tall,\nSilent sentinels of the cold,\nTheir windows, a mirror to the soul,\nReflecting the world, a world unfurled.\n\nThe streets, a canvas blank and white,\nA world where footprints are the only sight,\nYet, in this desolate scene,\nLife's resilience shines, serene.\n\nThe man, a symbol of the spirit,\nEndures the chill, a silent, solitary spirit,\nIn the frozen landscape's grip,\nHe finds his path, a path of grip.\n\nThe snow, a blanket vast and pure,\nA world where life finds its allure,\nIn this winter's embrace,\nLife's resilience, a tale to chase.\n\nSo, let the snowflakes fall and spin,\nIn this winter's embrace, a world divine,\nFor in the hushed embrace of winter's embrace,\nLife's resilience shines, a world of grace.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
