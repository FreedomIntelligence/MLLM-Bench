    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the potential structural damage to the vehicle prior to the fire and identify which areas of the car are most affected by the flames.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe vehicle has sustained significant structural damage, with the hood completely destroyed by the fire. The front of the car, including the engine compartment, is heavily damaged, and the vehicle is no longer in a recognizable state. The fire has caused extensive damage to the car's exterior, and the interior is likely to be severely affected as well.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a silver car is damaged by fire on the roadway, while another car watches and firemen look on. The vehicle appears to have significant structural damage due to the intense fire. The front of the car seems to be most severely affected, as there is smoke and fire spreading across the hood, and possibly into the open car door. The fire is not limited to the hood, as it appears to have spread to the roof and engulfed the entire car, including the trunk. The flames might have also caused structural damage to the car's bodywork, making it difficult to determine the overall condition of the vehicle's frame, interior, and mechanical components.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe pre-fire structural damage to the vehicle, especially the front-end collision impact.\n2. Assess and specify areas most affected by flames, focusing on visible fire damage.\n3. Include details of both flame engulfment and damage severity, prioritizing the car's front area.",
