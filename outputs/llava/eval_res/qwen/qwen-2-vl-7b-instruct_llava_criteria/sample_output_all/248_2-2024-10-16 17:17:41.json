    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the attributes of the two flags in the third row represented. Compare and contrast these attributes in terms of their symbolic meanings, color schemes, and iconography.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe third row of flags features the flag of Australia and the flag of Spain. Here are the attributes of these two flags and a comparison of their symbolic meanings, color schemes, and iconography:\n\n### Australia's Flag:\n- **Color Scheme**: The flag has a blue field with a white southern cross in the top left corner and a white kangaroo and a white seven-starred shield in the bottom left corner.\n- **Symbolic Meanings**: The blue color represents the sky and the ocean, while the white cross symbolizes Christianity. The kangaroo and shield are national symbols representing wildlife and the nation's heritage.\n- **Iconography**: The flag includes a kangaroo and a seven-starred shield, which are iconic symbols of Australia.\n\n### Spain's Flag:\n- **Color Scheme**: The flag is divided into four quadrants: the top left is blue with a yellow shield, the top right is yellow with a red shield, the bottom left is red with a yellow shield, and the bottom right is red with a yellow shield.\n- **Symbolic Meanings**: The blue and yellow colors are traditional Spanish colors, representing the kingdom of Aragon and the kingdom of Castile, respectively. The shields represent the historical regions of Spain.\n- **Iconography**: The flag features a shield with a lion, which is a traditional symbol of strength and courage in Spanish heraldry.\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Color Scheme**: Both flags use red and blue as dominant colors, but the specific patterns and arrangements are different. Australia's flag has a blue field with a white cross and additional symbols, while Spain's flag has a more complex arrangement of blue and yellow.\n- **Symbolic Meanings**: Both flags have deep historical and cultural significance. Australia's flag represents the country's natural beauty and heritage, while Spain's flag symbolizes the country's historical regions and strength.\n- **Iconography**: Australia's flag includes a kangaroo and a shield, representing wildlife and national identity. Spain's flag includes shields with lions, representing strength and courage.\n\nIn summary, both flags are rich in symbolism and color, but they represent different historical and cultural contexts. Australia's flag emphasizes national identity through wildlife and heritage, while Spain's flag celebrates its historical regions and strength.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two flags in the third row represent the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China. These flags have different attributes and symbolic meanings.\n\nThe United Kingdom flag is the Union Jack, which is a combination of several crosses: the Cross of Saint George (England), the Cross of Saint Andrew (Scotland), and the Cross of Saint Patrick (Ireland). This flag symbolizes the union of these nations under a single monarchy and represents their shared history and national pride. The flag is primarily red, white, and blue, reflecting the colors of the respective crosses and the national colors of the United Kingdom.\n\nOn the other hand, the People's Republic of China flag is a simple, rectangular red flag with a large yellow star in the center. The flag is symbolic of the Communist Party of China and the socialist state. The red color represents revolution and communism, while the yellow star represents the unity of the people, with its five points representing the five classes of Chinese society.\n\nIn terms of color schemes, the United Kingdom flag is more elaborate, featuring three primary colors compared to the single-color red flag of China. In terms of iconography, the United Kingdom flag is centered around representing a union of nations, while the People's Republic of China flag represents its political and social ideology through the iconic yellow star.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
