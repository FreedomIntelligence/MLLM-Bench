    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the endoscopy image of the stomach, describe the image in detail and identify anomalies visible in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts an endoscopy of a stomach, revealing the pink and red interior of the gastrointestinal tract. The lining of the stomach appears swollen, with a large hole or hollow area in the middle. The hole, filled with small pink and red granules, suggests the presence of gastritis. The granules are also scattered throughout the stomach, both inside and outside the hollow space, further indicating inflammation. This scene suggests an ongoing condition like the stomach disease erosive gastritis, which can lead to complications if not properly managed.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe endoscopy image depicts the interior of the stomach. The stomach lining appears to be inflamed and has a reddish-pink hue with visible vessels and capillaries. There are also some areas that appear more pronounced or elevated, which could be indicative of ulcers, lesions, or other abnormalities. The overall appearance suggests inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining. \n\nAnomalies visible in the image include:\n1. Increased vascularization and capillaries visible on the stomach wall.\n2. Elevated or nodular areas on the stomach wall, which could be indicative of ulcers or lesions.\n3. The overall redness and inflammation of the stomach lining.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any visible anomalies in the stomach lining, such as abnormal growths or coloration.\n2. Describe the overall condition of the stomach mucosa, including texture and vascular pattern.\n3. Mention the presence of any normal anatomical structures, such as gastric folds.",
