    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a comparison between Earth and Mars, two planets within our solar system. Here's a comparison of their atmospheric conditions and surface features:\n\n### Atmospheric Conditions:\n1. **Earth:**\n   - **Atmospheric Composition:** Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with small amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.\n   - **Pressure:** The atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 101.3 kilopascals (kPa), which is similar to the pressure at sea level on Earth.\n   - **Temperature:** The temperature varies significantly depending on latitude, altitude, and season. The average temperature at sea level is around 15°C (59°F).\n\n2. **Mars:**\n   - **Atmospheric Composition:** Mars' atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (95.3%), with nitrogen (2.7%) and argon (1.6%) being the next most abundant gases.\n   - **Pressure:** The atmospheric pressure at the Martian surface is extremely low, only about 6.5 millibars (mbar), which is about 0.00069 times that of Earth's atmospheric pressure.\n   - **Temperature:** The temperature varies widely depending on latitude, altitude, and season. The average temperature at the Martian surface is around -63°C (-81°F).\n\n### Surface Features:\n1. **Earth:**\n   - **Oceans and Seas:** Earth has large bodies of water, including oceans, seas, and lakes.\n   - **Continents:** Earth is divided into seven continents, each with distinct topography and landscapes.\n   - **Mountains and Valleys:** Earth has a diverse range of mountain ranges and valleys, including the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest.\n   - **Weather Systems:** Earth experiences a wide range of weather systems, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe weather conditions.\n\n2. **Mars:**\n   - **Canyons and Valleys:** Mars has extensive valleys and canyons, including the famous Valles Marineris, which is longer than the entire Earth's coastline.\n   - **Dust Storms:** Mars experiences massive dust storms that can last for months and cover large portions of the planet.\n   - **Craters:** Mars has numerous craters of various sizes, formed by impacts from asteroids and comets.\n   - **Seasonal Changes:** Mars experiences significant seasonal changes, including the formation of polar ice caps and the movement of the planet's polar ice caps.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Atmospheric Conditions:** Earth has a dense atmosphere with a high pressure and temperature, while Mars has a thin atmosphere with low pressure and temperature.\n- **Surface Features:** Earth has a diverse range of surface features, including oceans, continents, mountains, and weather systems, while Mars has extensive valleys, craters, and seasonal changes.\n\nThis comparison highlights the significant differences between the two planets in terms of their atmospheric conditions and surface features.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
