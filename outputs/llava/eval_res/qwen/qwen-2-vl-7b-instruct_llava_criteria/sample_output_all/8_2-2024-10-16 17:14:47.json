    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and describe its usage.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the image is a ceiling-mounted projector. This type of projector is typically used in settings where a fixed installation is preferred, such as home theaters, conference rooms, or classrooms. The projector is mounted on the ceiling, allowing it to project an image onto a wall or screen below. The design and features of the projector, such as the lens and ventilation ports, suggest that it is intended for high-quality projection.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a large lens, possibly the eyepiece of a projector, mounted on a ceiling. The lens is situated next to a fan, suggesting that it is likely connected to a projector unit, which is used for displaying images or videos onto a screen or surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a projector.\n2. Describe the projector's usage, such as displaying images or videos.",
