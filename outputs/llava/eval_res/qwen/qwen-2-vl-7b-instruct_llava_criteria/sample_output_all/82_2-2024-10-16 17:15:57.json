    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDeduce the type of materials (e.g., oil paint, acrylic, watercolor) that may have been used in creating these paintings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe paintings in the image appear to be created using oil paint. The textures and the way the colors blend and layer suggest the use of oil paints, which are known for their rich, creamy consistency and the ability to create detailed, textured effects.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, it is likely that the artist used watercolor or a similar transparent medium to create these flower paintings. The paintings have a light, watery appearance, and the flowers are depicted in various shades and colors, which are characteristic features of watercolor paintings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify texture and thickness indicative of oil or acrylic paint.\n2. Note color vibrancy and potential paint transparency suggesting watercolor.\n3. Assess brushwork and layering that could distinguish material types.",
