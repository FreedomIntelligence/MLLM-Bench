    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cats, each with distinct species-specific features:\n\n1. **Tiger (Top Left)**:\n   - **Stripes**: The tiger has distinct black stripes on a golden or tawny background.\n   - **Body**: The tiger has a robust body with a muscular build.\n   - **Tail**: The tiger has a long, bushy tail.\n\n2. **Lion (Bottom Left)**:\n   - **Mane**: The lion has a prominent mane of long, bristly hair that surrounds its head and neck.\n   - **Body**: The lion has a large, muscular body and a broad chest.\n   - **Tail**: The lion has a long, curved tail with a tuft of hair at the end.\n\n3. **Panther (Top Right)**:\n   - **Body**: The panther has a sleek, slender body with a short, bushy tail.\n   - **Color**: The panther has a chocolate or black coat with a metallic sheen.\n   - **Tail**: The panther has a short, bushy tail.\n\n4. **Lioness with Cubs (Bottom Right)**:\n   - **Body**: The lioness has a robust body with a broad chest and a short, bushy tail.\n   - **Cubs**: The lioness has three cubs, which are smaller in size with similar features to the adult lion.\n\nThese differences in body shape, coat color, and tail characteristics help distinguish between these four species of big cats.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
