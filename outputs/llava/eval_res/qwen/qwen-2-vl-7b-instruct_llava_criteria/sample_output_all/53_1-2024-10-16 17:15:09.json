    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe landmark in the picture is the Sydney Opera House, a world-renowned architectural masterpiece located in Sydney, Australia. The design concept and architectural style of the Sydney Opera House are the work of Danish architect Jørn Utzon.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is characterized by its distinctive sail-like structures, which are made of concrete and aluminum. The design concept behind the building is to mimic the shape of a group of shells or boats, depending on the point of view. This organic form is intended to reflect the natural surroundings of the Opera House, which is located on Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe sail-like structures are supported by a series of concrete columns that are hidden beneath the surface of the water. The roof is covered with a layer of aluminum panels that reflect the sunlight, creating a shimmering effect. The interior of the building is designed to provide excellent acoustics for live performances, with multiple performance spaces including the Concert Hall, the Opera Theatre, and the Studio Theatre.\n\nOverall, the design concept of the Sydney Opera House by Jørn Utzon is a blend of modern architecture and the natural environment, creating a unique and iconic landmark that has become a symbol of Sydney and Australia.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
