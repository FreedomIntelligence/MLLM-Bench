    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe computer screen in the image appears to have sustained significant damage, with multiple cracks radiating from a central point. This type of damage is typically caused by a sharp impact or a sudden jolt to the screen.\n\n### Evaluation of Damage:\n\n1. **Type of Crack**: The cracks are radial, indicating that the screen was likely struck by a sharp object or dropped from a height.\n2. **Severity of Damage**: The screen is likely non-functional, as the cracks extend across the entire surface, making it impossible to read or use the screen effectively.\n\n### Possible Ways to Repair:\n\n1. **Professional Repair**: The best option is to take the computer to a professional repair shop. They can assess the damage and determine if the screen is still repairable. If the screen is still intact under the cracks, they may be able to replace the cracked glass with a new one.\n\n2. **Screen Replacement**: If the entire screen is damaged beyond repair, the repair shop can replace the entire screen assembly, which may include the glass, LCD panel, and touch screen if applicable.\n\n3. **Insurance Claim**: If the computer is covered by an insurance policy, filing a claim may be an option. Ensure that the damage is documented properly, and all necessary paperwork is submitted to the insurance company.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n1. **Backup Data**: Before attempting any repairs, ensure that all important data is backed up. If the computer is not functioning properly, data loss could occur if the repairs are unsuccessful.\n\n2. **Insurance Policies**: Review the insurance policy to understand the coverage for screen damage. Some policies may cover accidental damage, while others may require specific coverage.\n\n3. **Screen Replacement Cost**: The cost of screen replacement can vary depending on the make and model of the computer. A professional repair shop can provide an estimate based on the specific components needed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the extensive damage to the screen, professional repair is the most viable option. It is recommended to consult with a repair shop to determine the feasibility of repair and the associated costs.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the extent and location of the screen damage.\n2. Suggest realistic repair methods for the identified damage.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the instruction's focus on evaluation and repair.",
