    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wooden piece is carved into an intricate flower pattern, and it features a star shape in the center, giving the impression of a sunburst. The carving creates a layered textured surface on the wood, adding depth and visual interest. The design is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, with the flower petals following a regular pattern, yet the varying sizes and shapes of the petals make the overall design feel unique and dynamic. The combination of the carved flower and the starburst center make this piece a striking piece of artistry and craftsmanship.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nA beautifully crafted piece of wood art displays an intricate pattern of interlocking circles and geometric shapes, creating a sense of depth and texture. The symmetrical design features a central circle surrounded by concentric circles, radiating outwards in a symmetrical pattern. The asymmetrical elements include the varying sizes and orientations of the shapes, adding complexity and visual interest to the piece. The craftsmanship is meticulous, with each cut and curve precisely executed, resulting in a stunning visual experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Describe the intricate patterns, including shapes and lines, and their arrangement.\n2. Mention the depth and texture of the carved wood, indicating 3D effect or flatness.\n3. Identify symmetrical or asymmetrical elements, noting repetition or variance.",
