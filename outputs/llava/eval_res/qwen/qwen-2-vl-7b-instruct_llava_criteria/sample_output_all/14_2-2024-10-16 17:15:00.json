Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExtract the definitions (def) and examples (ex) from the notes, and record the formulas using LaTeX.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are the definitions and examples from the notes, along with the formulas in LaTeX:\n\n### Definitions (Def)\n1. **Orthogonal Transformation**: A transformation \\( T \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) is orthogonal if it satisfies the following conditions:\n   - It is a linear transformation.\n   - It preserves the dot product.\n   - It preserves the length of vectors.\n   - It preserves the angle between vectors.\n\n2. **Matrix \\( A \\) is Orthogonal**: A matrix \\( A \\) is orthogonal if it is square and its transpose \\( A^T \\) is its inverse.
