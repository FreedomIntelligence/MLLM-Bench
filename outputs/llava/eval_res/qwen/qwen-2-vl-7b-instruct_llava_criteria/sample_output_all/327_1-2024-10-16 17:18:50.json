    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happens to the images from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the two images travel from left to right, the image loses contrast, giving it a silhouette appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe images in the series show a progression from a dark and underexposed photo on the left to a brighter and more vibrant photo on the right. This transformation likely involves adjusting various aspects of the image, such as brightness, contrast, and exposure, to enhance the overall quality and visual appeal. The left image appears to have been modified to correct the underexposure, resulting in a more balanced and visually appealing photo on the right.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in exposure, contrast, and color balance between images.\n2. Assess sharpness, noise, and detail preservation in both images.\n3. Evaluate dynamic range, highlighting shadow and highlight detail retention.",
