    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the shoe. Is it a safety hazard to keep wearing this shoe?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a pink and black shoe with a torn shoe lace, indicating potential wear and tear. While it may not be immediately hazardous, a torn shoe lace can cause discomfort and affect the shoe's functionality. It is advisable to repair the shoe or replace the damaged shoe lace to ensure safety and comfort while wearing the shoe. If left unattended, the shoe lace could break completely, causing the shoe to become loose and increasing the risk of injury.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe shoe in the picture shows significant damage, particularly on the toe area where the rubber is missing and exposed. This can be considered a safety hazard as it may lead to injuries such as cuts or abrasions on the toes. Additionally, the missing rubber could affect the shoe's grip and performance, making it unsafe for activities that require a secure footing.\n\nIt is recommended to replace the shoe to ensure safety and maintain performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
