    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image has accurate exposure with no obvious overexposed or underexposed areas. The focus is clear with no noticeable noise. The colors are rich, and the lighting is sufficient. The texture details are clear. The composition is centered, but the main subject is not clear, making it difficult to identify. Therefore, the quality is poor.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3. Assess the visibility and legibility of the text \"Love Playing Snake?\".",
