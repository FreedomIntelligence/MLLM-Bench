    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, two individuals are engaged in a handshake, indicating a formal or professional relationship. The setting appears to be a business meeting or a formal gathering, as suggested by the presence of a laptop, glasses of water, and documents on the table. The handshake typically symbolizes agreement, cooperation, or a formal introduction. Given the context, it is likely that the two individuals are either new acquaintances or are involved in a business deal or partnership. The handshake suggests a positive and cooperative interaction between the two parties.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
