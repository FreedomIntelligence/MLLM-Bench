    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe floor plan in the image appears to be designed with a balance of privacy and accessibility in mind. Here are some observations:\n\n### Privacy:\n1. **Bedrooms**: Each bedroom has an attached bathroom, which provides privacy for the occupants. The bedrooms are also separated from the living areas, ensuring a degree of privacy for the occupants.\n2. **Master Bedroom**: The master bedroom is located on the first floor and has an attached bathroom, further enhancing privacy.\n\n### Accessibility:\n1. **Living Area**: The living area is centrally located and is accessible from the main entrance, making it easily accessible to all parts of the house.\n2. **Dining Area**: The dining area is adjacent to the living area, allowing for easy access to communal spaces.\n3. **Kitchen**: The kitchen is also centrally located and is easily accessible from the dining area and the living area, facilitating easy meal preparation and serving.\n4. **Store**: The store is located near the kitchen, making it accessible for storage and supply access.\n5. **Prayer Room**: The prayer room is located near the kitchen and dining area, allowing for easy access for prayer activities.\n\n### Overall Design:\n- The layout of the bedrooms and bathrooms ensures that each bedroom has its own private space.\n- The living area, dining area, and kitchen are centrally located, promoting easy access and interaction among family members.\n- The prayer room is placed in a convenient location near the kitchen and dining area, which is ideal for religious activities.\n\nOverall, the floor plan seems to provide a good balance between privacy and accessibility, making it suitable for a family home.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
