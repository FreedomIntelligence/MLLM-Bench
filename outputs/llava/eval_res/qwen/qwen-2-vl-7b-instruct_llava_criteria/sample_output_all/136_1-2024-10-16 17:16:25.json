    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum gallery, specifically within a historical or classical-style building. The architectural style is characterized by:\n\n1. **High Ceilings and Vaulted Design**: The ceiling is high and has a vaulted design, which is common in classical and neoclassical architecture.\n2. **Skylights and Natural Light**: The presence of skylights allows natural light to flood the space, which is a feature often found in historically significant buildings designed to enhance the ambiance and provide a connection to the outdoors.\n3. **Large, Ornate Frames**: The paintings are framed in large, ornate frames, which is typical of art galleries that aim to showcase paintings with grandeur and elegance.\n4. **Wooden Floor**: The wooden floor has a polished look, which is common in museums to create a sense of historical continuity and respect for the space.\n\nThe cultural function of this space is primarily educational and artistic. It serves as a venue for the display and appreciation of art, allowing visitors to learn about historical paintings and cultural heritage. The grandeur of the space suggests that it is likely a significant museum, possibly one with a long history and a collection of important artworks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style elements like wall decor, ceiling, and lighting.\n2. Determine cultural function based on room contents and visitor activity.",
