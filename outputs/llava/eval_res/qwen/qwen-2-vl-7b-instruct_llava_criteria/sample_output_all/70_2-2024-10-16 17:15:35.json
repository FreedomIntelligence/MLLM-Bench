    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify any cultural or traditional attire and elements present in the scene, and infer the type of ceremony or event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a traditional wedding ceremony in Ghana. The couple is dressed in traditional Ghanaian attire, with the groom wearing a white outfit and the bride wearing a colorful outfit with a headpiece. The setting appears to be indoors, and there are people present who are likely family members or guests. The groom is handing over a book, which is a common tradition in Ghanaian weddings, symbolizing the exchange of wedding vows. The presence of a floral arrangement and the formal attire of the guests further indicate that this is a significant and culturally rich event.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are individuals dressed in traditional African attire, particularly a man wearing a kilt and a woman in a colorful dress. They are standing around a table, which indicates a formal event or ceremony. The presence of a cell phone on the table might suggest that the event is being documented or that the attendees are using it for communication. The group of people is engaged in a specific activity, and their attire suggests that the event is culturally or traditionally based.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
