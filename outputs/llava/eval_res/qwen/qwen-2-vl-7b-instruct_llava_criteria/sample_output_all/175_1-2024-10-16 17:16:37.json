    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 675*900, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,900) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (675,0), where approximately would you place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\"?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in the image, we can consider the middle-left portion of the image, which is approximately at 0.15, 0.23. This placement would make the sign visible and accessible to the customers. The coordinates for this placement would be (0.25, 0.16, 0.45, 0.36), with the sign being slightly to the left of the center of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\", we need to consider the overall layout of the image and the position of the sign relative to the other objects.\n\n1. The sign is located on the right side of the image.\n2. The sign is above the lemons, which are stacked in a specific arrangement.\n3. The sign is likely to be placed above the lemons, possibly on a shelf or a stand.\n\nAssuming the image is a top-down view and the lemons are stacked in a way that they are easily visible from above, the coordinates of the sign can be estimated as follows:\n\n- The top left corner of the image is at (0,900), and the bottom right corner is at (675,0).\n- The sign is likely to be located in the upper part of the image, possibly around the middle or slightly higher.\n\nA rough estimate for the coordinates of the sign might be around (350, 600). This is a rough estimate and may not be exact, but it gives a general idea of where the sign is located in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Coordinates should approximate (450,600) for the \"Lemons 6 for $3\" sign.",
