    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe racquet in the image appears to have a broken handle. Here are some steps to repair it:\n\n1. **Remove the old handle grip**: Use a racquet grip remover tool to carefully remove the old grip from the handle. Be gentle to avoid damaging the handle further.\n\n2. **Inspect the handle**: Check the handle for any cracks or damage beyond the grip area. If there are any cracks or significant damage, the handle may need to be replaced.\n\n3. **Prepare the handle for new grip**: Clean the handle with a damp cloth to remove any dirt or debris. You can also use a small amount of alcohol to help remove any residue.\n\n4. **Apply a new grip**: Use a new grip tape or overgrip material to cover the handle. Start at one end and work your way down, pressing the material firmly to ensure it adheres properly.\n\n5. **Cut to size**: Trim the grip to the appropriate length, leaving a small overlap at the end. Fold the overlap back and secure it with a small piece of tape.\n\n6. **Tighten the grip**: Use a racquet grip tool to tighten the grip, ensuring it is secure and comfortable.\n\n7. **Test the racquet**: After the repair, test the racquet by hitting a few shots to ensure the grip is secure and the racquet feels comfortable.\n\nIf the damage is extensive or if the handle cannot be repaired, you may need to consider replacing the racquet with a new one.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
