    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of wear of the headset, and infer the possible cause of the wear.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a person is holding a black headset with a fuzzy texture on the headband and ear pads. The headset appears to be worn down to the fabric, which indicates significant wear and tear. The possible cause of this wear could be regular use over a prolonged period, as headsets are often used daily by people engaged in activities such as gaming, listening to music, or participating in online meetings. The wear could also be a result of a lack of proper care, such as not regularly cleaning the headset or storing it in a dusty or poorly organized space. Overall, the headset's condition suggests that it has been used extensively and not well-maintained.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe headset in the image shows significant wear on the headband and ear pads. The headband has visible fraying and wear, particularly in the areas where the padding meets the metal frame. The ear pads also appear to be worn, with the leather or synthetic material showing signs of tear and fraying.\n\nThe possible causes of this wear could be:\n\n1. **Frequent Use**: The headset is being used frequently, leading to regular contact and wear on the surface.\n2. **Improper Storage**: The headset might be stored improperly, causing it to be compressed or subjected to pressure that leads to wear.\n3. **Material Quality**: The material used for the padding might be prone to wear and tear, especially if it is not made of durable or high-quality materials.\n4. **Handling**: The headset might be mishandled, leading to rough treatment that causes wear.\n\nTo minimize further wear, it would be advisable to store the headset properly, avoid rough handling, and consider using a protective case or cover.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify wear on headset: peeling material, discoloration, deformation.\n2. Infer wear causes: usage, material quality, environmental factors.",
