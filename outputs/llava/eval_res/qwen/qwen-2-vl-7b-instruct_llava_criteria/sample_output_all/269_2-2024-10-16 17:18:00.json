    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCould you analyze the potential causes of the vehicular accident in the image, considering the extent of damage to the vehicle?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the vehicular accident appears to be a rear-end collision. The extent of damage to the vehicles suggests that the impact was significant. Here are some potential causes of the accident:\n\n1. **Speeding**: One or both vehicles may have been traveling at a high speed, which could have increased the force of the collision.\n2. **Following Too Close**: Insufficient following distance can lead to rear-end collisions if the vehicle in front suddenly stops or slows down.\n3. **Reckless Driving**: Actions such as tailgating, abrupt braking, or aggressive maneuvering can cause rear-end accidents.\n4. **Driver Error**: Distracted driving, such as using a phone or not paying attention to the road, can lead to a rear-end collision.\n5. **Mechanical Failure**: Although less common, a mechanical failure in one of the vehicles could have contributed to the accident if it led to sudden braking or loss of control.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, further investigation would be required, including examining the vehicles for any mechanical issues and reviewing any available dashcam footage or witness statements.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, two cars are parked on the side of the road, one of which seems to have sustained significant damage from the collision. The extent of the damage suggests that the accident was severe. Possible causes of such an accident can be:\n\n1. Reckless driving: Two vehicles could have been traveling at high speeds, leading to a loss of control, resulting in a head-on collision.\n2. Vehicle malfunction: One of the vehicles might have experienced mechanical failure, leading to a loss of control or an inability to respond to the approaching vehicle.\n3. Weather conditions: Slippery or wet roads can reduce tire grip and control, increasing the risk of accidents.\n4. Driver's distraction or fatigue: Both drivers might have been momentarily distracted or fatigued, leading to a lack of attention on the road and the inability to react to the approaching vehicle in time.\n5. Impaired judgment or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs: The drivers might have been impaired, leading to poor decision-making, and an increased likelihood of a collision.\n\nIt is essential to understand that the specific cause of the crash cannot be determined solely from the image, but these are potential factors that could have contributed to the accident. Regardless of the cause, the image emphasizes the importance of safe driving practices and being aware of one's surroundings to prevent such severe accidents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the point of impact and describe the extent of damage to both vehicles.\n2. Mention the potential causes such as a sudden brake from the front car.",
