Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompose a poem about a mountain sunrise, the solitary hiker, and the interplay of dawn light with nature.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the mist, a lone hiker stands\nIn the shadow of the mountain range\nWith the sun rising in the distance,\nHe gazes on the spectacle before him.\n\nThe sky turns shades of purple and red\nAs mountains meet the horizon line\nThe sun peaking from behind its crest\nBringing warmth and life to the scene.\n\nA backpacker, he's made his way to this view\nThrough mountain trails and winding paths\nTo witness the dawn's majestic glow\nOn the peaks and through the valleys.\n\nBut it's not just the sun's golden hue\nThat draws him to the summit's heights\nIt's also the peace and solitude they bring\nThe stillness of the world beneath.\n\nThe hiker embraces the quiet dawn\nAs the sun lifts the mountain's veil\nHe stands in awe, his soul reborn\nAmidst the wonders of nature's tale.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the cradle of the earth's embrace,\nA hiker stands alone, a silhouette in the chase,\nOf dawn's first rays, breaking through the night's embrace,\nAs nature wakes, in a symphony of light.\n\nThe mountain's spine, a jagged line,\nCuts through the sky, a timeless sign,\nOf strength and beauty, in its silent reign,\nA sentinel, steadfast, through the rain.\n\nThe sun, a fiery orb, ascends,\nIts warmth and light, a balm to mend,\nThe hiker's soul, with hope it blends,\nAs shadows lengthen, and the world is mended.\n\nThe mist, a veil, in gentle flow,\nCovers the peaks, in a misty glow,\nA dance of light, in the morning show,\nA moment of peace, a hiker's goal.\n\nThe mountains, silent, watch with care,\nAs dawn's embrace, their heart does share,\nA moment of stillness, in the early air,\nA hiker's heart, with nature's love it shares.\n\nIn this embrace, of dawn's first light,\nThe hiker finds, a peace so bright,\nA moment of stillness, in the early fight,\nA hiker's heart, with nature's love it lights.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
