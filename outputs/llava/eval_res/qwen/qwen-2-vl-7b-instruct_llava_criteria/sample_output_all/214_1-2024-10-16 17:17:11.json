Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the scatter plot, describe the relationship between the vaccination rate and excess deaths and predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the scatter plot, it is evident that there is a strong positive correlation between vaccination rate and excess deaths in the state. Vaccination rate is plotted on the vertical axis and excess deaths on the horizontal axis. The line representing the correlation is almost vertical, which implies a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can assume the slope of the line, which represents the rate of increase in excess deaths per percentage increase in vaccination rate. Taking the slope as constant, we can calculate the excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85% by applying the slope to the x-coordiantes (85% on the vertical axis) and finding the corresponding y-coordinates (excess deaths on the horizontal axis). The calculated excess deaths would depend on the actual slope of the line in the scatter plot, which may vary from one state to another.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe scatter plot shows a negative correlation between the vaccination rate and excess deaths. As the vaccination rate increases, the excess deaths decrease. The line of best fit has a slope of approximately -0.59, indicating a moderate negative relationship.\n\nTo predict the approximate excess deaths for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we can use the line of best fit. The equation of the line of best fit can be approximated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = \\text{Intercept} - 0.59 \\times \\text{Vaccination Rate} \\]\n\nGiven that the slope is -0.59 and assuming the intercept is around 40 (as the line of best fit intersects the y-axis near this value), we can estimate the excess deaths as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 40 - 0.59 \\times 85 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} = 40 - 49.65 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Deaths} \\approx -9.65 \\]\n\nSince the number of excess deaths cannot be negative, we can interpret this as the state having approximately 9 excess deaths less than expected based on the vaccination rate. Therefore, for a state with a vaccination rate of 85%, we predict approximately 9 fewer excess deaths compared to a state with a lower vaccination rate.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Describe the approximate trend between the vaccination rate and excess deaths: excess deaths decrease as the vaccination rate increases.  \n2. Confirm prediction of approximate excess deaths for a state with 85% vaccination rate is between 25% to 30%.",
