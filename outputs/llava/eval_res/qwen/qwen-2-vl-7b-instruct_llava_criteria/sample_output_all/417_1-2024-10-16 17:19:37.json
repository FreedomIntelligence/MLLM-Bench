    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease identify and name each visible component of the watch mechanism, such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nInside the watch mechanism, we can see various components such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates. The gears are metal parts with teeth that help transfer power from one component to another. The jewels are usually made of a precious metal and are used to reduce friction between gears, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. The spring is a vital component that provides the power required to keep the watch running. Lastly, the plates are the main structural components of the watch movement, which help hold all the components together and guide their movements. These components work together to make the watch tick and keep accurate time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image shows the intricate gears and components of a mechanical watch movement. Here is a breakdown of the visible components:\n\n1. **Gears**: \n   - **Large Gear**: A large central gear at the bottom center.\n   - **Intermediate Gear**: A smaller gear above the large gear, connected by a gear train.\n   - **Smaller Gears**: Several smaller gears scattered throughout, including a gold-colored gear near the top left and a purple-colored gear near the top right.\n   \n2. **Jewels**:\n   - These are small, precision-cut diamonds or other gemstones used to reduce friction in the movement. They can be seen in various locations, such as the center of the large gear and on the sides of the intermediate gears.\n\n3. **Springs**:\n   - Spring Bars: These are the small, spring-like structures that provide the mechanical energy to the gears. They are visible on the sides of the gears and on the movement plate.\n\n4. **Plates**:\n   - **Movement Plate**: The large, central plate that holds all the gears and jewels in place.\n   - **Index Plate**: The plate with the numbers \"51\" and \"52\" which indicates the position of the gears.\n\n5. **Other Components**:\n   - **Winding Lever**: A lever at the bottom center that is used to wind the watch.\n   - **Escape Wheel**: The gear at the top right that releases the energy to the balance wheel.\n   - **Balance Wheel**: The gear at the top center that oscillates to keep the watch running.\n\nThese components work together to keep the watch running accurately. The movement of the gears is coordinated by the jewels, which reduce friction, and the springs provide the necessary energy to drive the gears.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all visible components like gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n2. Accurately name each component based on watchmaking terminology.\n3. Ensure descriptions are clear and correspond to the specific parts in the image.",
