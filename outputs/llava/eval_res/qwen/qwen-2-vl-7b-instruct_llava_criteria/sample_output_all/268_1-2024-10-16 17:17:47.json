    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, it appears that the circuit board has sustained significant damage, particularly around the areas where the capacitors (C1 and C2) are located. Here are some possible reasons for the damage:\n\n1. **Overheating**: The presence of melted or burnt components suggests that the circuit board may have experienced overheating. This could be due to a short circuit, excessive current draw, or a failure in the cooling system.\n\n2. **Short Circuit**: The damaged areas around the capacitors might indicate a short circuit. This could be caused by a physical damage to the board, such as a solder bridge or a component failure.\n\n3. **Excessive Current**: If the circuit board was drawing more current than it was designed for, it could have overheated and caused damage.\n\n4. **Power Supply Failure**: The damage could also be due to a failure in the power supply or regulation circuitry, which might have caused the board to overheat or fail.\n\n5. **Physical Damage**: The board might have been physically damaged, such as being dropped or mishandled, which could have caused the components to fail or the solder to melt.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, further investigation would be required, such as checking the power supply, testing individual components, and possibly performing a thermal analysis to understand the temperature profile of the board.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
