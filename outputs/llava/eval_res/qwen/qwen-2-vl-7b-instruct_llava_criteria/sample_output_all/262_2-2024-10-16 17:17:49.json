    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from a sandstorm. Sandstorms are a type of dust storm that occurs in arid and semi-arid regions, where loose sand and dust are lifted into the air by strong winds. The sand and dust particles are carried by the wind, creating a cloud of debris that can be extremely dangerous for humans and animals. \n\nThe veils serve as a barrier to protect the people's faces from the sand and dust particles, which can cause irritation, respiratory problems, and even blindness if inhaled. The veils also help to keep the people's clothing and hair from being blown away by the strong winds.\n\nIn addition to protecting themselves from the sandstorm, the people in the picture are also using donkeys and carts to transport themselves and their belongings. This is a common practice in arid and semi-arid regions where donkeys and carts are used for transportation due to the lack of infrastructure and the difficulty of navigating the terrain with vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
