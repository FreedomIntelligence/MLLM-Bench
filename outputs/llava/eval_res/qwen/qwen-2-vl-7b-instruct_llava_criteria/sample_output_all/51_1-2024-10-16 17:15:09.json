    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the building in the picture? To which period can its construction be traced back to?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe building in the picture is an ancient, large, and historic structure, likely a castle or a fortress. Its construction can be traced back to the Xi'an period in China, which dates back to around the 11th century. It has a unique design, featuring a high stone wall lining its side and a distinctive stepped appearance. The steepness of the wall and its impressive height make it a fascinating sight and a testament to the architectural and engineering prowess of the time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe building in the picture is the Great Wall of China. The construction of the Great Wall can be traced back to the 7th century BC, during the Spring and Autumn Period, when various states in what would later become China began building walls to protect themselves from invasions. Over the centuries, these walls were expanded and connected to form the Great Wall of China, which reached its peak during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The section of the wall shown in the picture is located in the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall, which is known for its well-preserved stone structures and scenic views.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
