    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image appears to depict a stylized evolutionary timeline, showing the progression from a primate to a modern human. The stages are:\n\n1. A primate-like creature.\n2. A more upright primate.\n3. A person using a simple tool.\n4. A person using a more complex tool.\n5. A person using a bow and arrow.\n6. A person using a modern smartphone.\n\nBased on this trend, the next stage in the sequence would likely involve the continued use of technology, potentially leading to even more advanced tools, devices, or perhaps even artificial intelligence or other forms of advanced technology.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
