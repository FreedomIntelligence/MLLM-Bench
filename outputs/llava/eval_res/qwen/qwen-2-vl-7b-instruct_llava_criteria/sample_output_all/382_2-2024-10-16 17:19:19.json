    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the dancer's landing technique, and suggest the next movements that would follow.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe dancer is currently in a passé position with one leg lifted and the other extended, indicating a pas de bourrée or a similar movement. Based on this position, the dancer is likely preparing to land back on both feet.\n\n**Landing Technique:**\nThe dancer will likely land on both feet, maintaining balance and control. The extended leg will be brought down to the ground, and the body will shift to prepare for the next movement.\n\n**Next Movements:**\n1. **Rond de Jambes:**\n   - The dancer can perform a rond de jambe in the air, rotating the extended leg around the body.\n   - This movement can be followed by a développé, where the dancer extends the leg out to the side and then back to the ground, maintaining balance.\n\n2. **Pirouette:**\n   - The dancer can transition into a pirouette, spinning around on the extended leg.\n   - This can be followed by a jeté or a sauté, where the dancer jumps up and lands on the other leg.\n\n3. **Pas de Deux:**\n   - If the dancer is performing with a partner, they can engage in a pas de deux, where the partner leads or supports the dancer's movements.\n   - This can include lifts, turns, and other synchronized movements.\n\n4. **Changement de Pied:**\n   - The dancer can change the supporting leg and perform a new movement, such as a battement tendu or a tendu en l'air.\n\nThese movements will allow the dancer to transition smoothly from the current position and maintain a fluid performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the woman in the blue dress appears to be in the middle of a ballet move, with her arms and legs extended. As she appears to be dancing on the pavement in front of a building, she might be performing an outdoor dance or show. Since she seems to be in mid-air, it is likely that she will be performing a controlled landing, which involves bending her knees slightly to absorb the impact of her feet touching the pavement. Once she lands, she might continue her dance, possibly following a specific choreography or improvising her movements. The next movements could include graceful footwork, turns, or even more aerial maneuvers, depending on the style and complexity of the dance being performed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately predict the dancer's landing technique based on body posture and movement direction.\n2. Suggest plausible next dance movements that could logically follow from the landing position.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects a coherent understanding of dance motion and sequence.",
