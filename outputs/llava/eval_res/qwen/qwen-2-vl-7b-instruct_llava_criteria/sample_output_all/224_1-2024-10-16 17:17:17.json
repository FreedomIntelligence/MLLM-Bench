    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss the natural relationship between the penguin and the seal.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a penguin is seen interacting with a seal in a marine environment. The penguin is standing in front of the seal while the latter has its mouth open. While penguins and seals are both marine animals, they belong to different taxonomic groups, specifically penguins are birds and seals are mammals. \n\nThe natural relationship between these two species is generally that of predator-prey or competition for resources. Seals, being predators of fish and crustaceans, might view penguins as potential prey or a source of competition for the same food resources. On the other hand, penguins can be considered as prey for larger seal species, although this is not always the case. The image depicts a more neutral interaction, with both animals simply coexisting in their shared habitat. They might occasionally engage in non-aggressive behaviors, such as curiosity or exploration, as seen in this image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a seal and a penguin in an underwater setting. This interaction is a natural part of the predator-prey relationship that exists in many marine ecosystems. The seal is likely a predator, and the penguin is its prey. In the wild, seals often hunt penguins for food, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where penguins are common. The penguin, in turn, is a prey species for many marine predators, including seals, sharks, and birds. This relationship is crucial for maintaining the balance of the ecosystem, as it helps regulate the populations of both species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the penguin and seal as having a predator-prey relationship.\n2. Describe the predatory nature of seals towards penguins.",
