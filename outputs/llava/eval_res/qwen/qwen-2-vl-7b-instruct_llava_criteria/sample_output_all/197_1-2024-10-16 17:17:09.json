    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a hand with a small, round wound on the palm. The wound appears to be clean and not actively bleeding. Here are some steps to take for wound care:\n\n1. **Clean the Wound**: Use mild soap and water to gently clean the wound. Avoid using harsh chemicals or alcohol, as these can irritate the skin.\n\n2. **Dry the Wound**: Pat the wound dry with a clean cloth. Excess moisture can promote infection.\n\n3. **Apply a Bandage**: Place a sterile bandage over the wound to protect it from dirt and germs. If the wound is large, consider using a bandage that can be easily removed.\n\n4. **Monitor the Wound**: Keep an eye on the wound for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. If the wound looks infected, seek medical attention.\n\n5. **Use Antiseptic Ointment**: Apply an antibacterial ointment to the wound to help prevent infection. Petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment can be used for this purpose.\n\n6. **Keep the Wound Clean**: Wash your hands before and after handling the wound to prevent the spread of germs.\n\n7. **Protect the Wound**: Avoid exposing the wound to dirt or water while it is healing. Keep the wound covered when necessary.\n\nIf the wound becomes red, swollen, or painful, or if there is any drainage or signs of infection, it is important to seek medical attention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
