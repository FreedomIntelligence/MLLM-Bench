    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image  |image_\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
