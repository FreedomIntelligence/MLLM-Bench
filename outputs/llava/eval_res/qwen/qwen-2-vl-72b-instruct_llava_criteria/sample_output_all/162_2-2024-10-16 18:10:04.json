    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headlines in the image use emotive language to capture the reader's attention and evoke strong emotions. Here are some key examples and their potential impacts:\n\n1. **\"As judge brands teacher's murderer 'evil'\"**:\n   - **Emotion**: Fear, Anger, Outrage\n   - **Impact**: This headline uses the word \"evil\" to describe the murderer, which immediately creates a sense of horror and disgust. It aims to draw readers in by highlighting the severity of the crime and the judge's strong condemnation.\n\n2. **\"hear the full heart-rending story on our award-winning podcast\"**:\n   - **Emotion**: Sympathy, Empathy\n   - **Impact**: The phrase \"heart-rending\" is used to evoke a sense of deep sadness and sorrow. This is likely intended to engage readers emotionally and encourage them to listen to the podcast for a more detailed and emotional account of the story.\n\n3. **\"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\"**:\n   - **Emotion**: Solidarity, Anger\n   - **Impact**: This headline uses a call to arms, suggesting a collective response to a perceived threat. It aims to rally readers and create a sense of unity and defense against an external threat.\n\n4. **\"Tory Right's warning to Rishi amid fears he's thinking of sacking Home Secretary\"**:\n   - **Emotion**: Concern, Anxiety\n   - **Impact**: The use of words like \"warning\" and \"fears\" creates a sense of urgency and concern. It suggests that there is significant political tension and potential consequences, which can engage readers who are interested in political news.\n\nOverall, the emotive language in these headlines is designed to elicit strong emotional responses from readers, such as fear, anger, sympathy, and solidarity. This can increase reader engagement and encourage them to read further or listen to the podcast for more information.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotive language in headlines and specify its emotional tone (e.g., \"evil\", \"heart-rending\").\n2. Explain how the chosen language could influence readers' emotions or perceptions.",
