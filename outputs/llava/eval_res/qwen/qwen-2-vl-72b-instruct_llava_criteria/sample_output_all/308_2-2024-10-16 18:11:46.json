    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I reside in a location where the temperature is -5°C and need to select one of the sets of upper garments from the picture to wear, which one would provide better warmth?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGiven the temperature of -5°C, the garment on the right (the third one from the left) would provide better warmth. This garment appears to be a thick, fur-lined coat, which is designed to retain heat and keep you warm in cold weather. The other two options, while stylish, are less likely to provide adequate insulation against such low temperatures.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the picture, one woman is wearing a coat and hat and is more bundled up than the others. If the temperature is -5°C, it's essential to prioritize warmth, so the woman's attire, including the coat and hat, would provide better warmth and protection from the cold. The coat and hat would ensure proper insulation and help maintain body heat in the cold weather. The other sets of upper garments may not offer the same level of warmth, and the woman in those sets might be less protected and more exposed to the cold.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the right-most garment as providing better warmth.\n2. Justify warmth based on material, coverage, and layering visible in the image.",
