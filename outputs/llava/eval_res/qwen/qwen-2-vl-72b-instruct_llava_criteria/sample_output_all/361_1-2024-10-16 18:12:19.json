Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompose a poem about a mountain sunrise, the solitary hiker, and the interplay of dawn light with nature.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the mist, a lone hiker stands\nIn the shadow of the mountain range\nWith the sun rising in the distance,\nHe gazes on the spectacle before him.\n\nThe sky turns shades of purple and red\nAs mountains meet the horizon line\nThe sun peaking from behind its crest\nBringing warmth and life to the scene.\n\nA backpacker, he's made his way to this view\nThrough mountain trails and winding paths\nTo witness the dawn's majestic glow\nOn the peaks and through the valleys.\n\nBut it's not just the sun's golden hue\nThat draws him to the summit's heights\nIt's also the peace and solitude they bring\nThe stillness of the world beneath.\n\nThe hiker embraces the quiet dawn\nAs the sun lifts the mountain's veil\nHe stands in awe, his soul reborn\nAmidst the wonders of nature's tale.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon the peak, where dawn's first light caresses the mountain's silent height, A solitary hiker stands, Awe-struck by nature's grand command.\n\nThe sun, a golden orb, ascends, Gilding the world with warmth that mends. Shadows flee, the mist recedes, Revealing landscapes, wide and spread.\n\nThe hiker's heart, with wonder glows, As dawn's embrace the valley shows. Each step, a dance with light and air, A moment, pure, beyond compare.\n\nThe mountain's slopes, in hues of gold, Reflect the sun's ascent, untold. The interplay of the image/artificial Intelligence.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes mountain sunrise, solitary hiker, and dawn light with nature.\n2. Imagery captures the beauty and interplay of light in nature.\n3.
