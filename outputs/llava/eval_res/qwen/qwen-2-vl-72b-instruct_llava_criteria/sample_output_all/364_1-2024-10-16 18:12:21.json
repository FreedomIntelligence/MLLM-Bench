Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCreate a free verse on the energy of a protest, the collective voice for change, and democracy's spirit at a capitol.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nA gathering on a grassy field,\nA city's skyline as their backdrop,\nThousands of voices in unison,\nA peaceful protest in action.\n\nIn front of a grand, historic building,\nA crowd of people with a shared goal,\nTo speak for those unheard,\nTo demand change and break the mold.\n\nThe energy of the protest,\nA force that cannot be ignored,\nUnited, they stand and shout,\nFor a brighter future and clean power.\n\nA collective voice for change,\nA testament to democracy's strength,\nWith every protester in the crowd,\nThe spirit of progress and unity grows.\n\nTogether, they make their stand,\nFor a better world and fair play,\nFighting for the rights of all,\nIn this public display.\n\nA wave of hope and determination,\nThe future they envision for their nation,\nWith every person in the field,\nA collective force that cannot yield.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the shadow of the golden dome,\nA sea of voices swells and roars,\nEach sign a beacon, each chant a tome,\nOf unity, of justice, of more.\n\nThe air vibrates with the energy of change,\nA collective breath that cannot be contained,\nEach face a story, each heart a range,\nOf emotions, of hopes, of dreams untamed.\n\nThe capitol stands, a symbol of might,\nYet humbled by the people's might,\nFor democracy is not just a sight,\nBut a living force, a beacon of light.\n\nIn this moment, the barriers fall,\nThe walls of apathy crumble and flee,\nFor when the people stand tall,\nThe spirit of freedom reigns supreme.\n\nThis is the energy of a protest,\nA symphony of voices for change,\nA testament to the power of the best,\nIn democracy's heart, where all are strange.\n\nSo let the signs rise, let the chants ring,\nLet the capitol hear the people's song,\nFor in this moment, the future begins,\nAnd the spirit of democracy lives on.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
