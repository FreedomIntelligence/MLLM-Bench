    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe racquet in the picture appears to have a damaged grip and some wear on the strings. Here are some suggestions for repairing it:\n\n1. **Replace the Grip**: The grip seems to be frayed and worn out. You should replace it with a new one. You can use overgrip tape or a full grip replacement. Overgrip tape is easier to apply and can be changed more frequently, while a full grip replacement provides a more durable solution.\n\n2. **Inspect the Strings**: Check the strings for any signs of wear or damage. If the strings are frayed or broken, they should be restrung. It's important to use high-quality string and have it done by a professional to ensure proper tension and longevity.\n\n3. **Check the Frame**: Although not clearly visible in the picture, inspect the frame for any cracks or damage. If the frame is damaged, it may need to be replaced.\n\n4. **Clean the Racquet**: Before making any repairs, clean the racquet thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris that might have accumulated.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you are not comfortable making these repairs yourself, consider taking the racquet to a professional tennis shop or a qualified technician who can assess and repair it properly.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you can restore the racquet to a good condition and ensure it performs well during play.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
