    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSolve the problem in the image and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a piece of paper with handwritten text describing the movements of people at a zoo. It appears to be a timeline or a summary of people's visits to the zoo. The paper contains several times, such as 11:30 and 7:30, along with numbers of people visiting at these times. Additionally, there is a question at the end of the text that appears to be related to the overall content. Based on the information available, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation without additional context.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo solve the problem, we need to add up the number of people who arrived at the zoo at different times and find the total number of people at the zoo now.\n\n1. At 9:00, there were 5 people at the zoo.\n2. At 11:00, 4 more people came.\n3. At noon, 7 more people came.\n\nNow, let's add these numbers together:\n\n\\[ 5 \\text{ (initial people)} + 4 \\text{ (people at 11:00)} + 7 \\text{ (people at noon)} \\]\n\n\\[ 5 + 4 = 9 \\]\n\\[ 9 + 7 = 16 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of people at the zoo now is 16.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly transcribe the handwritten text, including numbers and words.\n2. Accurately solve the arithmetic problem presented in the text, whose answer is 16.\n3. Provide a clear explanation of the steps taken to reach the solution.",
