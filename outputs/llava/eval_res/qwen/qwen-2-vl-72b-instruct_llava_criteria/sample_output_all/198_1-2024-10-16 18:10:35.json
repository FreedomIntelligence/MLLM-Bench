    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, interpret the thermometer reading and give some advice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a person is holding a thermometer with a reading of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is within the normal range for a healthy individual, typically considered as a mild fever. It suggests that the person may be experiencing some level of discomfort or discomfort due to the slight temperature increase.\n\nHowever, the temperature reading should not be taken as definitive or diagnostic, as personal thermometer readings can be influenced by factors such as time of day or ambient temperature. If the person continues to experience symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, or difficulty breathing, it is essential to see a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate treatment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe thermometer reading in the image shows a temperature of 37.3°C. This is slightly above the normal body temperature range of 36.5°C to 37°C. Here are some pieces of advice:\n\n1. **Monitor Your Temperature**: Keep an eye on your temperature over the next few hours. If it continues to rise or if you develop other symptoms like chills, cough, or difficulty breathing, seek medical advice.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\n\n3. **Rest**: Get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\n\n4. **Medication**: If you are uncomfortable, over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may help reduce fever and alleviate symptoms.\n\n5. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: If the fever persists for more than a few days, or if you have underlying health conditions, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember, these are general guidelines. Always follow the advice of a healthcare professional for specific medical conditions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the thermometer shows 38.1 degrees Celsius.\n2. Evaluate the advice given for a fever of 38.1 degrees Celsius.\n3. Check for medical accuracy and relevance of the advice to the temperature.",
