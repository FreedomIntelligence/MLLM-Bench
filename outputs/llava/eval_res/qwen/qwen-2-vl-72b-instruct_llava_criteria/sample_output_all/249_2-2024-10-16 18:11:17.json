    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows two planets, Earth and Mars, side by side. Here is a comparison and contrast of their atmospheric conditions and surface features as depicted:\n\n**Atmospheric Conditions:**\n- **Earth:** The image shows Earth with a thick, dynamic atmosphere that appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight. Clouds are visible, indicating the presence of water vapor and weather systems. The atmosphere supports a wide range of life.\n- **Mars:** Mars has a much thinner atmosphere, which appears reddish-brown in the image. There are no visible clouds, suggesting a lack of significant weather systems like those on Earth. The atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide and is much less dense than Earth's.\n\n**Surface Features:**\n- **Earth:** The surface of Earth is diverse, with a mix of land and water. Continents and oceans are clearly visible, along with features like coastlines, mountain ranges, and cloud formations. The presence of water bodies and vegetation is evident.\n- **Mars:** The surface of Mars appears predominantly rocky and barren. There are no visible bodies of water or vegetation. The reddish-brown color is due to the iron oxide (rust) on the surface. The surface features include craters, valleys, and possibly dried-up riverbeds, indicating a history of water flow.\n\nIn summary, Earth is characterized by a thick, dynamic atmosphere and a diverse surface with water and vegetation, while Mars has a thin atmosphere and a rocky, barren surface with no visible water or vegetation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
