    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThrough the lens of primate behavior and communication, what might the facial expression and gaze of the gorilla in the image suggest about its current state or intentions?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe gorilla in the image has a calm and composed facial expression, with its gaze directed forward. In primate behavior and communication, such a demeanor can suggest several things:\n\n1. **Relaxed State**: The gorilla appears to be in a relaxed state, as there are no visible signs of tension or aggression, such as bared teeth, dilated pupils, or an arched back.\n\n2. **Observation**: The forward gaze could indicate that the gorilla is observing its surroundings or something of interest. Primates often use their gaze to gather information about their environment or other individuals.\n\n3. **Social Interaction**: In a social context, this expression might be part of a non-aggressive interaction with other members of the group. Gorillas use various facial expressions to communicate with each other, and a calm, neutral face can be a sign of peaceful coexistence.\n\n4. **Curiosity**: The gorilla might be curious about something or someone, which is a common behavior in primates when they encounter new or interesting stimuli.\n\nOverall, the gorilla's facial expression and gaze suggest a state of calmness and attentiveness, rather than aggression or distress.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the gorilla has a somewhat pensive expression on its face, looking upwards with its eyes wide open. This facial expression might suggest that the gorilla is experiencing curiosity, contemplation, or interest in something it sees in the distance. Given their typically gentle and intelligent nature, gorillas are known to exhibit various emotions and facial expressions, and this particular expression could be interpreted as the gorilla trying to understand its environment or engage with its surroundings. It is important to note that as a visual AI assistant, I can only provide descriptions of the gorilla's facial expression based on the available image data, and cannot accurately interpret emotions or intentions without more context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify specific facial features indicating emotion (e.g., eyes, mouth) related to primate behavior.\n",
