    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 700*1050, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,1050) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (700,0). Please give the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe spoon tail is located at the top of the image, slightly to the right and above the center. Its approximate coordinates would be (150, 0.14, 230, 0.49).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must include coordinates close to the reference: (200,315), the closer the better",
