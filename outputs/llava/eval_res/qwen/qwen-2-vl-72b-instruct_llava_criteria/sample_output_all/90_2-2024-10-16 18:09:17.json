    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the image in detail. Which bible verse perfectly describes this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a man standing on a path that appears to be made of the pages of an open book. The path winds through a lush, green field, and it is lined with grass on either side. In the distance, another person can be seen walking along the same path. On the left side of the image, there is a small signpost that reads \"RIGHT PATH.\"\n\nThis image beautifully illustrates the concept of following a guided path, with the book symbolizing knowledge, wisdom, and guidance. The signpost indicating the \"RIGHT PATH\" suggests that the path laid out by the book is the correct or best one to follow.\n\nA Bible verse that perfectly describes this picture is Proverbs 3:5-6:\n\n\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\"\n\nThis verse encourages trust in divine guidance and promises that following this guidance will lead to a clear and straight path, much like the path made of book pages in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man standing in a grassy field with a giant book under his feet. There are also two smaller books in the scene. The man appears to be reading the book and may be surprised by its massive size. The image seems to be a creative and surreal depiction, with the man potentially engaged in some kind of fantastical or imaginative scenario.\n\nA fitting bible verse to describe this picture would be Psalm 40:4: \"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.\" This verse emphasizes the value of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and could be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of reading and learning throughout life. In the context of the image, the man's engagement with the giant book may symbolize a pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, as well as an appreciation for the power of literature and imagination.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the man, open book path, sign \"RIGHT PATH\", and relate to Psalm 119:105.\n2. Explain how the image metaphorically represents the given bible verse.",
