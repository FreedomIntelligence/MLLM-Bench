    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo determine the authenticity of the badge, let's compare its design elements with standard badges from the specified region, Mayberry, which is a fictional town from the television show \"The Andy Griffith Show.\"\n\n1. **Text Font and Arrangement:**\n   - The badge has the word \"SHERIFF\" at the top and \"MAYBERRY\" at the bottom. The font is bold and clear, which is typical for sheriff badges.\n   - The arrangement of the text is standard, with the title \"SHERIFF\" prominently displayed at the top.\n\n2. **Symbols:**\n   - The badge features a prominent star in the center, which is a common symbol for sheriff badges.\n   - The star is encircled by a decorative border, which is also typical for such badges.\n\n3. **Material Appearance:**\n   - The badge appears to be made of a shiny, metallic material, likely silver or a silver-colored metal. This is consistent with the appearance of many sheriff badges.\n\n4. **Additional Design Elements:**\n   - The badge has a decorative border with small, evenly spaced dots, which adds to its ornate appearance. This type of design is often seen in badges to enhance their visual appeal.\n\nBased on these observations, the badge appears to be consistent with standard sheriff badges from the fictional town of Mayberry. The design elements, including the text font, arrangement, symbols, and material appearance, align with what one would expect from a sheriff's badge in that context. Therefore, it is likely authentic within the context of the fictional setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
