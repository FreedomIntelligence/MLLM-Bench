    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image showcases a collection of official presidential automobiles from the early 20th century. Based on current design trends, future automotive design evolution can be inferred as follows:\n\n1. **Electric and Hybrid Vehicles**: The inclusion of the 1912 Baker Electric suggests a historical precedent for electric vehicles. Current trends indicate a significant shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles due to environmental concerns and advancements in battery technology.\n\n2. **Autonomous Features**: Modern vehicles are increasingly equipped with autonomous driving features. Future designs are likely to incorporate advanced autonomous capabilities, making vehicles more self-driving.\n\n3. **Sustainable Materials**: There is a growing emphasis on using sustainable and eco-friendly materials in vehicle manufacturing. Future designs will likely prioritize materials that are recyclable and have a lower environmental impact.\n\n4. **Enhanced Safety Features**: Current vehicles are equipped with advanced safety features such as collision avoidance systems, lane departure warnings, and adaptive cruise control. Future designs will continue to integrate more sophisticated safety technologies.\n\n5. **Connectivity and Integration**: Vehicles are becoming more connected, with features like smartphone integration, Wi-Fi connectivity, and over-the-air updates. Future designs will likely have even more advanced connectivity options, allowing for seamless integration with other devices and systems.\n\n6. **Streamlined and Aerodynamic Designs**: Modern vehicles are designed to be more aerodynamic to improve fuel efficiency and performance. Future designs will likely continue this trend, with even more streamlined and efficient shapes.\n\n7. **Innovative Interior Designs**: Current trends show a shift towards more spacious and comfortable interiors with advanced technology integration. Future designs may include more flexible seating arrangements, enhanced entertainment systems, and advanced climate control features.\n\n8. **Modular and Customizable Components**: There is a growing trend towards modular design, allowing for easier customization and upgrades. Future vehicles may have more interchangeable components, enabling owners to tailor their vehicles to their specific needs and preferences.\n\nIn summary, future automotive design evolution will likely focus on electric and hybrid propulsion, advanced autonomous features, sustainable materials, enhanced safety, connectivity, streamlined aerodynamics, innovative interiors, and modular customization.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
