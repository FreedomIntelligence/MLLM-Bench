Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExtract the definitions (def) and examples (ex) from the notes, and record the formulas using LaTeX.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n### Definitions (def)\n- An \\( n \\times n \\) matrix \\( A \\) is an orthogonal transformation if and only if:\n  - It has \\( n \\) mutually perpendicular rows or columns with unit length.\n  - Rows must be independent (can't be multiples of each other).\n\n### Examples (ex)\n- \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\) linearly dependent\n- \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\) independent but not \\( \\perp \\)\n\n### Formulas\n- Dot product: \\( \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = 0 \\leftrightarrow \\mathbf{x} \\perp \\mathbf{y} \\)\n- Rows/columns must have unit length: \\( \\| \\mathbf{x} \\| = \\sqrt{\\sum x_i^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}} \\)\n- The rows or columns of \\( A \\) form an orthonormal basis of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A}^T = \\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{I} \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\mathbf{A}^T \\)\n- Transpose \\( [\\mathbf{A}]^T \\) switches the rows and columns: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\ndef A: A transformation matrix A is an orthogonal matrix, meaning it has a determinant of 1 and its columns and rows are orthonormal.\nex: A transformation matrix is a fundamental tool in linear algebra and geometry, as it can transform points, vectors, and other geometric objects from one coordinate system to another.\n\ndef IFFT: The inverse of a forward Fourier Transform, which converts a time-domain signal back to its frequency components.\nex: IFFT is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, digital image processing, and communication systems.\n\ndef If: An integral transform, which converts a function from the time domain to the frequency domain.\nex: If is essential in transforming periodic signals, such as those encountered in control systems and telecommunication networks.\n\ndef ∫A: The integral of a function A over a specific range.\nex: ∫A is a mathematical operation used in calculus, physics, and engineering to determine the area under the curve of a function.\n\ndef M: A matrix M is an orthogonal matrix, meaning it has a determinant of 1, and its columns and rows are orthonormal.\nex: M is used in linear algebra to represent transformations and transformations matrices.\n\ndef 2: A scalar quantity equal to 2.\nex: 2 is a fundamental number in mathematics and science, often used as a constant or a base for calculating other quantities.\n\ndef 2+I: A complex number, with a real part of 2 and an imaginary part of 1.\nex: 2+I is an important element in complex analysis, which can be used to represent rotations and other transformations in a two-dimensional space.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
