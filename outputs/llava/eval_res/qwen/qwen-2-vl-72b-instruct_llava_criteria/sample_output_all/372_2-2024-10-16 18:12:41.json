    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nYou are a website developer. You have the attached image and you need to code a website interface with the similar characteristics, color, shapes, etc. Please do so.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo view the function($user input(\"n == 1\n```\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nI'm sorry, but as a text-based AI, I cannot create visual content. However, I can provide advice on how to achieve a similar look for your website using HTML, CSS, and other web development tools.\n\nTo recreate the color scheme, you can use the color picker tool to identify the primary and secondary colors from the image, and then apply these colors to the website elements, such as text, borders, and backgrounds.\n\nFor the shapes and design, consider using CSS shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, and apply gradients or transformations, like rotation or scaling, to give them a dynamic appearance. Additionally, you can create a custom CSS set of buttons and icons that resemble those used in the image.\n\nTo achieve the layout and positioning of the elements on the website, use HTML structuring elements like headings, paragraphs, and containers. Arrange the content in a logical and visually appealing manner, and make sure the navigation and the main content are organized in a clear and intuitive way.\n\nIn summary, you can achieve a similar look and feel to the image by identifying and applying the primary and secondary colors, using CSS shapes and transformations, and creating custom CSS buttons and icons. Additionally, use HTML structuring elements to organize and position the content effectively.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Website interface must reflect similar layout, including navigation bar, image placement, and text sections.\n2. Color scheme and font style should closely match the original image's aesthetic.\n3. Shapes and design elements like buttons or icons should be consistent with those in the image.",
