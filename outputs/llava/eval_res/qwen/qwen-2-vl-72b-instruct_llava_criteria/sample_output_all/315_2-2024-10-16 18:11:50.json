Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the given complex fraction, we can use the method of combining the numerator and the denominator into single fractions.

The final answer is 0.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3.
