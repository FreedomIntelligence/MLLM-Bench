The past century has seen numerous cultural and social changes, which are reflected in the fashion trends depicted in these illustrations.\n\nFor instance, the early 20th century illustrations showcase long dresses covering most of the body, with corsets and petticoats being common elements of women's attire. This portrays a time of modesty and societal expectations for women's clothing, which might have been influenced by the Victorian era's conservative values.\n\nAs the years progressed, fashion evolved to represent women's increased independence and growing social and economic roles. The illustrations from the 1920s to the 1950s showcase shorter skirts and more defined waistlines, reflecting the influence of the flapper subculture and the changing cultural roles for women during times of World War I, the Roaring Twenties, and the postwar era.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s brought significant shifts in fashion, as women embraced unconventional styles, including pantsuits, miniskirts, and dresses with bold patterns or colors. This period also marked the rise of the feminist movement, which contributed to a reevaluation of societal expectations and norms around women's clothing.\n\nIn recent decades, fashion has continued to evolve, reflecting the globalization of cultures, advancements in technology, and changing social norms. These illustrations showcase the diversity in fashion trends and the adaptability of the fashion industry in responding to the shifting cultural and societal landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of fashion trends from 1900 to the present demonstrates how clothing styles have evolved alongside societal change, reflecting the emergence of new cultural influences, social norms, and the changing roles of women in society.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
