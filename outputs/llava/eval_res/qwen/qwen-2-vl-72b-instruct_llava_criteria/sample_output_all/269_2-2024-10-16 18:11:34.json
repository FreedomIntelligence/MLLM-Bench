    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCould you analyze the potential causes of the vehicular accident in the image, considering the extent of damage to the vehicle?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a rear-end collision involving two vehicles. Based on the visible damage, here are some potential causes of the accident:\n\n1. **Tailgating**: The vehicle in the rear appears to have collided with the back of the vehicle in front, suggesting that the rear vehicle may have been following too closely, failing to maintain a safe distance.\n\n2. **Distracted Driving**: The driver of the rear vehicle might have been distracted, leading to a failure to notice the vehicle in front slowing down or stopping.\n\n3. **Speeding**: The rear vehicle may have been traveling at an excessive speed, reducing the driver's ability to react in time to the vehicle in front.\n\n4. **Braking Failure**: There could have been an issue with the brakes of the rear vehicle, preventing it from stopping in time.\n\n5. **Weather Conditions**: Although the image does not show clear weather conditions, slippery roads or poor visibility could have contributed to the accident.\n\n6. **Driver Fatigue**: The driver of the rear vehicle might have been tired, leading to slower reaction times and impaired judgment.\n\n7. **Impaired Driving**: The possibility of the driver being under the influence of alcohol or drugs cannot be ruled out, as these substances can significantly impair driving ability.\n\n8. **Mechanical Failure**: A mechanical failure in the rear vehicle, such as a malfunctioning accelerator or brake system, could have led to the collision.\n\n9. **Driver Inexperience**: The driver of the rear vehicle might have been inexperienced, leading to poor decision-making and reaction times.\n\n10. **Traffic Congestion**: The presence of traffic congestion could have contributed to the accident, as drivers often have less space to maneuver in such conditions.\n\nThese are potential causes based on the visible damage and common factors in rear-end collisions. A more detailed investigation would be required to determine the exact cause.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, two cars are parked on the side of the road, one of which seems to have sustained significant damage from the collision. The extent of the damage suggests that the accident was severe. Possible causes of such an accident can be:\n\n1. Reckless driving: Two vehicles could have been traveling at high speeds, leading to a loss of control, resulting in a head-on collision.\n2. Vehicle malfunction: One of the vehicles might have experienced mechanical failure, leading to a loss of control or an inability to respond to the approaching vehicle.\n3. Weather conditions: Slippery or wet roads can reduce tire grip and control, increasing the risk of accidents.\n4. Driver's distraction or fatigue: Both drivers might have been momentarily distracted or fatigued, leading to a lack of attention on the road and the inability to react to the approaching vehicle in time.\n5. Impaired judgment or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs: The drivers might have been impaired, leading to poor decision-making, and an increased likelihood of a collision.\n\nIt is essential to understand that the specific cause of the crash cannot be determined solely from the image, but these are potential factors that could have contributed to the accident. Regardless of the cause, the image emphasizes the importance of safe driving practices and being aware of one's surroundings to prevent such severe accidents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the point of impact and describe the extent of damage to both vehicles.\n2. Mention the potential causes such as a sudden brake from the front car.",
