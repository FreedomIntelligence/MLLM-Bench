There are numbers from 15 to 20 visible across the puzzle, with some numbers located in the center and others on the periphery. To implement an identical game, you can use a programming language like Python to create a 9x9 grid using a nested list. You can then fill the grid with numbers from 15 to 20 randomly or according to a specific pattern. Next, you can write a function to check if a given set of number combinations results in a valid crossword puzzle by ensuring that each row, column, and diagonal contains the numbers from 15 to 20. If the function returns \"yes,\" the number combination is valid, and you can display the puzzle on the screen. If it returns \"no,\" you can prompt the user to try again or adjust the number combination until a valid puzzle is generated.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify game as sliding puzzle with numbered tiles; mention grid and tile combination mechanics.\n2. Describe the gameplay objective to combine tiles for a higher-numbered tile.\n3. Include code implementation reflecting game rules and sliding tile mechanism.",
