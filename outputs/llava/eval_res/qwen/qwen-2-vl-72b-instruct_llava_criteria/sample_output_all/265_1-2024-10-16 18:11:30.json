    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Here are some possible circumstances that could lead to this situation:\n\n1. **Slip and Fall**: The person might have slipped on a wet floor, as indicated by the \"Caution\" sign nearby. This could have caused them to fall and land on the floor, scattering their papers.\n\n2. **Medical Emergency**: The person could have experienced a medical emergency, such as fainting or having a heart attack, which led to them falling to the ground.\n\n3. **Accidental Trip**: The person might have tripped over an object or obstacle in the corridor, causing them to fall and drop their papers.\n\n4. **Work-related Accident**: If the person was in the process of moving or organizing papers, they might have lost their balance and fallen.\n\n5. **Intentional Rest**: Although less likely, the person might have intentionally lain down on the floor, possibly due to exhaustion or as part of a performance art piece.\n\nEach of these scenarios could explain the presence of the person on the floor and the scattered papers around them.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
