    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSpeculate on the relationship between the children and the cheerful elderly man based on the scenarios.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image of the children and the cheerful elderly man, it appears that the man could be a family member, such as a grandfather or an uncle, and the children might be his grandchildren or nephews. The man appears to be teaching them how to prepare food properly, such as cutting tomatoes and carrots on a cutting board. This kind of scenario is often seen when family members bond and share experiences, such as learning valuable life skills or spending quality time together. The man's cheerful demeanor suggests that he is enjoying the time spent with the children, and they may be learning some important family traditions or values through this activity.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a man and a child in a kitchen, preparing food together. The man is wearing a light blue denim shirt over a white t-shirt, while the child is wearing a striped shirt and denim shorts. They appear to be engaged in a cooking activity, with the child seated on the counter and the man standing beside him, both smiling and focused on their task.\n\nBased on the context and their interactions, it is reasonable to speculate that the man could be the child's father or a close family member, such as an uncle or older sibling. The presence of a kitchen setting and the activity of cooking together suggests a familial or close relationship, where the adult is teaching or guiding the child in a domestic activity. The man's demeanor and the child's comfort in the situation further support this speculation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the interaction and emotional expressions suggesting a relationship.\n2. Evaluate the context of the scenario for relational cues.",
