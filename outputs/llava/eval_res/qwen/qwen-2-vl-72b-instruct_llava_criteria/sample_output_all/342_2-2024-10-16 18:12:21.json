    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the ethical issues in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a robbery in progress, which raises several ethical issues:\n\n1. **Violence and Threat**: The use of a weapon to threaten the individual behind the counter is a clear violation of ethical principles regarding violence and harm to others.\n\n2. **Property Rights**: The act of robbery involves the unlawful taking of property, which infringes on the property rights of the owner.\n\n3. **Coercion and Intimidation**: The individual being threatened is being coerced into compliance through intimidation, which is ethically unacceptable.\n\n4. **Lack of Consent**: The individual being robbed does not consent to the taking of their property, which is a fundamental ethical issue.\n\n5. **Public Safety**: The act of robbery in a public place also poses a risk to the safety of other individuals present, which is a concern for public safety and ethical responsibility.\n\n6. **Legal and Social Norms**: Robbery violates legal and social norms, which are established to maintain order and protect individuals and their property.\n\nThese issues highlight the ethical complexities and the harm caused by such actions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a man wearing a black mask and holding a toy gun, aiming it at a woman. The ethical issues associated with this situation include the potential for causing harm or fear in another person with the toy gun, even though it's not a real weapon. The man's actions might be perceived as threatening, inappropriate, or offensive, especially since the woman doesn't appear to be aware of the situation. This scenario highlights the importance of responsible behavior, especially when handling any kind of firearm, toy or not, to ensure the safety and well-being of others.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the act of aggression or threat present.\n2. Recognize the potential distress of the victim.\n3. Note any implications of power imbalance or coercion.",
