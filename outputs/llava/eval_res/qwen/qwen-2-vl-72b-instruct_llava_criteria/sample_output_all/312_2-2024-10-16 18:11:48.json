Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCalculate the value of I in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe integral in the image is given by:\n\n\\[ I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\ln(x)}{4 \\cdot \\sin^2(\\ln(x))} \\, dx \\]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution method. Let's set:\n\n\\[ u = \\ln(x) \\]\n\nThen, the differential \\( du \\) is:\n\n\\[ du = \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx \\]\n\nSince \\( x = e^u \\), we have:\n\n\\[ dx = e^u \\, du \\]\n\nThe limits of integration also change. When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( u = \\ln(0) \\), which is undefined. However, we can consider the limit as \\( x \\) approaches 0 from the right. When \\( x = 1 \\), \\( u = \\ln(1) = 0 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( u \\) and \\( du \\) into the integral, we get:\n\n\\[ I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\frac{u}{4 \\cdot \\sin^2(u)} \\cdot e^u \\, du \\]\n\nThis integral is quite complex and does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. It involves the product of a logarithmic function, a trigonometric function, and an exponential function, which typically requires advanced techniques or numerical methods to evaluate.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( I \\) cannot be determined analytically using elementary functions. It would require numerical integration methods to approximate the value.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the equation provided in the image, I is equal to 4. Sin(2I).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer correctly calculates I as -25/56 from the integral in the image.\n2. Solution demonstrates understanding of integral calculus and trigonometric identities.\n3. Response includes a step-by-step explanation of the integral calculation process.",
