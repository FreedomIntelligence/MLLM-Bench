    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyzing the pairwise relationships between all characters in the diagram.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, three people are standing together, possibly celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. The woman and two kids are holding up cow-shaped and possibly horse-shaped hats, which could be part of a party theme or decoration. The pairwise relationships between the characters are as follows:\n\n1. The woman is standing in the middle.\n2. The two kids are on either side of her, with one on her left and the other on her right.\n\nThese three people create a cohesive group, likely enjoying a fun and memorable event together.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a group of three individuals, each holding a different character mask. Here is an analysis of the pairwise relationships between the characters on the masks:\n\n1. **Peppa Pig and Suzy Sheep**:\n   - **Peppa Pig** is a popular animated character from the children's television series \"Peppa Pig.\"\n   - **Suzy Sheep** is a friend of Peppa Pig in the series.\n   - **Relationship**: Peppa Pig and Suzy Sheep are friends.\n\n2. **Peppa Pig and Danny Dog**:\n   - **Danny Dog** is another character from the \"Peppa Pig\" series.\n   - **Relationship**: Peppa Pig and Danny Dog are friends.\n\n3. **Suzy Sheep and Danny Dog**:\n   - Both Suzy Sheep and Danny Dog are friends of Peppa Pig.\n   - **Relationship**: Suzy Sheep and Danny Dog are likely friends as well, given their shared association with Peppa Pig.\n\nIn summary, all the characters (Peppa Pig, Suzy Sheep, and Danny Dog) are friends within the context of the \"Peppa Pig\" series.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the relationship in a pairwise fashion.\n2. Use social cues like body language, attire, and props for reasoning.\n3. Avoid definitive statements of the relationships.",
