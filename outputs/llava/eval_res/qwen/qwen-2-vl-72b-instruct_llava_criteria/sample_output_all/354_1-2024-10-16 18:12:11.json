    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image appears to be AI-generated. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Wave Size and Perspective**: The wave in the image is disproportionately large compared to the cityscape. Such a massive wave would likely be a tsunami, which would not be visually coherent with the rest of the image.\n\n2. **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting and shadows in the image do not seem to match consistently. The wave appears to have a different light source compared to the buildings and the sky.\n\n3. **Details and Sharpness**: The details in the wave and the cityscape do not align smoothly. The wave looks more like a photograph of a real wave superimposed onto the cityscape, rather than being part of the same scene.\n\n4. **Overall Composition**: The overall composition of the image looks staged or manipulated, which is a common characteristic of AI-generated images.\n\nThese factors suggest that the image is likely a digitally manipulated or AI-generated composition rather than a real photograph.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
