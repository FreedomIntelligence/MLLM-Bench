    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe phone in the picture appears to be an iPhone with significant damage to its back panel. Here is an evaluation of the damage and its potential impact on usability:\n\n1. **Back Panel Damage**:\n   - The back panel is cracked and broken, particularly around the camera area and the bottom right corner.\n   - The camera module itself seems intact, but the surrounding glass is shattered.\n\n2. **Usability Without Repair**:\n   - **Camera Functionality**: The camera module might still be functional, but the broken glass around it could affect the quality of photos and videos taken.\n   - **Water Resistance**: The broken back panel could compromise the phone's water resistance, making it more susceptible to water damage.\n   - **Structural Integrity**: The structural integrity of the phone is compromised, which could lead to further damage if the phone is dropped or subjected to pressure.\n   - **Aesthetic Concerns**: The broken back panel is unsightly and might be a concern for some users.\n\n3. **Recommendation**:\n   - **Repair**: It is recommended to replace the back panel to restore the phone's structural integrity, water resistance, and aesthetic appeal.\n   - **Temporary Use**: If immediate repair is not possible, the phone might still be usable for basic functions, but it should be handled with extra care to avoid further damage.\n\nIn summary, while the phone might still be usable for basic functions, it is advisable to get the back panel repaired to ensure long-term functionality and protection.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
