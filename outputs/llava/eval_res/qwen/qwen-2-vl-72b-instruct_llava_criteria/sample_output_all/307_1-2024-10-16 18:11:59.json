    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nTaking into consideration the material of the shoes, which pair of shoes in the picture is best suited for long-distance running?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several pairs of shoes stored on shelves in a room. A suitable pair of shoes for long-distance running would be a pair of running shoes, which can be identified by their lightweight, breathable, and cushioned design. The image does not provide enough information to determine the material of the shoes. However, it is likely that the shoes are made from materials like synthetic and mesh for the upper part and a cushioned, supportive, and durable sole with good traction for long-distance running. To find the best pair, it would be necessary to search specifically for running shoes among the stored shoes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine which pair of shoes is best suited for long-distance running, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Material**: Running shoes typically have a breathable upper made from mesh or synthetic materials to keep feet cool and dry.\n2. **Support and Cushioning**: Good running shoes should have adequate cushioning to absorb impact and provide support.\n3. **Fit**: The shoes should fit snugly but not be too tight, allowing for some room to move your toes.\n\nBased on the image, the best pair of shoes for long-distance running appears to be the pair located in the top left corner of the shelf. These shoes seem to have a mesh-like upper, which is commonly used in running shoes for breathability. Additionally, they appear to have a robust sole, which is essential for cushioning and support during long-distance running.\n\nHowever, without more specific details about the shoe models and their features, it's challenging to make a definitive recommendation. It's always best to consult with a professional or try on different pairs to find the most suitable running shoe for your specific needs.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify shoes that appear designed for running based on material and structure.\n2. Assess suitability for long-distance running, considering material durability and comfort.\n3. Exclude shoes clearly unsuitable for running (e.g., high heels, boots).",
