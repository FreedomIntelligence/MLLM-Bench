Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression, we need to first identify the relevant data for the regression analysis. In this case, we will use the \"depreciation and amortization\" data as it is a common proxy for capital expenditures.\n\nHere are the steps to perform the linear regression:\n\n1. **Identify the Data:**\n   - Depreciation and Amortization (in thousands):\n     - 2020: 651,523\n     - 2021: 1,495,380\n     - 2022: 2,224,169\n\n2. **Calculate the Mean of X and Y:**\n   - Mean of X (Years): (2020 + 2021 + 2022) / 3 = 2021\n   - Mean of Y (Depreciation and Amortization): (651,523 + 1,495,380 + 2,224,169) / 3 = 1,457,024\n\n3. **Calculate the Slope (b):**\n   - b = Σ[(Xi - X_mean) * (Yi - Y_mean)] / Σ[(Xi - X_mean)^2]\n\n   - For 2020:\n     - (2020 - 2021) * (651,523 - 1,457,024) = -1 * (-805,501) = 805,501\n   - For 2021:\n     - (2021 - 2021) * (1,495,380 - 1,457,024) = 0 * 38,356 = 0\n   - For 2022:\n     - (2022 - 2021) * (2,224,169 - 1,457,024) = 1 * 767,145 = 767,145\n\n   - Σ[(Xi - X_mean) * (Yi - Y_mean)] = 805,501 + 0 + 767,145 = 1,572,646\n\n   - For 2020:\n     - (2020 - 2021)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\n   - For 2021:\n     - (2021 - 2021)^2 = 0^2 = 0\n   - For 2022:\n     - (2022 - 2021)^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\n   - Σ[(Xi - X_mean)^2] = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2\n\n   - b = 1,572,646 / 2 = 786,323\n\n4. **Calculate the Intercept (a):**\n   - a = Y_mean - b * X_mean\n   - a = 1,457,024 - 786,323 * 2021\n   - a = 1,457,024 - 1,586,902,383 = -1,585,445,359\n\n5. **Predict the Capital Expenditure for 2023:**\n   - Y = a + b * X\n   - Y = -1,585,445,359 + 786,323 * 2023\n   - Y = -1,585,445,359 + 1,585,445,359 = 0\n\nHowever, this result seems unrealistic.
