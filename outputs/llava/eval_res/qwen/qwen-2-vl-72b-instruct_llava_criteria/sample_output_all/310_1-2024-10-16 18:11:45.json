    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSolve the problem 11 in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the problem states that the area of the triangular ABC is 1950 square centimeters. The triangle has a base that is 7 times as long as the altitude and is 3 times as wide. The height of the triangle is 24 centimeters. We can use this information to solve the problem, but it would involve solving multiple equations, which goes beyond the scope of a simple text description. Instead, I recommend using a graphing calculator or software to find the solution, as they can visualize the triangle and solve the equations more effectively.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo prevent scald\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of triangles PQR, PUS, PUQ, and PSR in the image.\n2. Application of congruence criteria to prove PUQ â‰… PSR.\n3. Explanation includes reasoning based on properties of equilateral triangles.",
