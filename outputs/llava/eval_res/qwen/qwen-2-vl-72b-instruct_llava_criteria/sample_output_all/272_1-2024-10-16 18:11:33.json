    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a professional setting, likely a meeting or an interview, where two individuals are engaged in a handshake. Here are some nuances and potential interpretations of their relationship:\n\n1. **Formal Setting**: The environment suggests a formal or semi-formal business setting, indicated by the office furniture, documents, and the presence of a laptop and notepads.\n\n2. **Handshake**: The handshake is a common gesture of greeting, agreement, or conclusion in professional contexts. It suggests a mutual understanding or the beginning of a formal agreement.\n\n3. **Body Language**: Both individuals are smiling, indicating a positive and amicable interaction. Their body language is relaxed yet professional, suggesting a friendly and respectful relationship.\n\n4. **Eye Contact**: The eye contact between the two individuals is direct and confident, which is typical in professional interactions where trust and respect are important.\n\n5. **Contextual Clues**: The presence of another person observing the handshake could indicate that this is an interview or a meeting where decisions are being made. The observer's posture and expression suggest interest and approval.\n\nBased on these observations, the two individuals engaged in the handshake could be in one of the following relationships:\n\n- **Interviewer and Interviewee**: The handshake could be at the beginning or end of a job interview, indicating the start of the interview or the conclusion of a successful discussion.\n- **Business Partners**: They could be business partners or colleagues agreeing on a deal or decision.\n- **Client and Service Provider**: One could be a client and the other a service provider, finalizing an agreement or acknowledging a successful meeting.\n\nOverall, the handshake and the context suggest a professional relationship characterized by mutual respect and agreement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
