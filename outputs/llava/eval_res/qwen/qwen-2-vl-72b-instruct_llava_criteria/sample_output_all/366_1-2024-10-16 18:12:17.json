    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the heart of the fog, a solitary figure leaped into the air, his body suspended in a moment of pure exhilaration. The road beneath him was shrouded in mystery, its path hidden by the dense mist that enveloped the landscape. Each step forward was a step into the unknown, a journey into the depths of the soul.\n\nThe man, dressed in dark attire, was a symbol of resilience and determination. His leap was not just a physical act but a metaphorical one, representing the courage it takes to embrace the unknown. The foggy road was more than just a physical barrier; it was a representation of life's uncertainties, the challenges that lie ahead, and the courage it takes to face them.\n\nAs he soared above the road, the man felt a sense of liberation. The weight of the world seemed to lift from his shoulders, replaced by a newfound sense of freedom. The road, once a daunting obstacle, now became a canvas for his dreams and aspirations. Each step forward was a step closer to his destiny, a journey towards self-discovery and enlightenment.\n\nThe fog, once a hindrance, became a symbol of hope. It reminded him that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward. The road may be uncertain, but the journey is what truly matters. With each leap, the man felt a surge of energy, a renewed sense of purpose. He was no longer just a traveler on a foggy road; he was a pioneer, a trailblazer, forging his own path towards the unknown.\n\nAs the mist began to clear, the man landed back on the road, his heart filled with a sense of wonder and anticipation. The journey ahead was still uncertain, but he was no longer afraid. He had faced his fears and emerged victorious, ready to embrace whatever lay ahead. The open road was no longer a daunting obstacle but a symbol of hope, a beacon of light guiding him towards a brighter tomorrow.\n\nIn the end, the man realized that the true beauty of life lies not in the destination but in the journey itself. The foggy road was a metaphor for life's uncertainties, but it was also a reminder of the strength and resilience that lies within us all. With each leap, he discovered a new part of himself, a new aspect of his soul. And as he continued down the road, he knew that no matter what lay ahead, he would face it with courage, determination, and a heart full of hope.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
