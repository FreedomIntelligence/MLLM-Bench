    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the linear flow of energy in these food chains.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe linear flow of energy in these food chains is as follows:\n\n1. **Terrestrial Food Chain:**\n   - **Trees** → **Deer** → **Lion**\n   - Energy flows from trees (producers) to deer (primary consumers) and then to lions (secondary consumers).\n\n2. **Terrestrial Food Chain:**\n   - **Flower** → **Flies** → **Frog** → **Snake** → **Eagle**\n   - Energy flows from flowers (producers) to flies (primary consumers), then to frogs (secondary consumers), snakes (tertiary consumers), and finally to eagles (quaternary consumers).\n\n3. **Aquatic Food Chain:**\n   - **Flower** → **Small Fishes** → **Larger Fish** → **Birds**\n   - Energy flows from flowers (producers) to small fishes (primary consumers), then to larger fish (secondary consumers), and finally to birds (tertiary consumers).\n\nIn each of these food chains, energy is transferred from one organism to another, starting with producers (plants) and moving up to various levels of consumers.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays several food chains, showing the linear flow of energy from plants to animals. These food chains include a carnivorous plant, such as a Venus flytrap and an aquatic plant like a water lily, both of which consume smaller organisms as their primary food source. The linear flow of energy is evident as the smaller organisms, such as insects or small fish, are consumed by larger organisms, like predators or carnivorous plants. The larger organisms, in turn, may be preyed upon by even larger animals, like lions or eagles. The image emphasizes the interconnection and dependency of various species in the ecosystem and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and healthy environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The first chain: trees -> deers -> lion\n2. The second chain: flower -> flies -> frog -> snake -> eagle.\n3. The third chain: flower -> small fishes -> larger fish -> birds.\n4. There is no strict format in describing each chain. However, the answer should explicitly and accurately points out every element on each chain.",
