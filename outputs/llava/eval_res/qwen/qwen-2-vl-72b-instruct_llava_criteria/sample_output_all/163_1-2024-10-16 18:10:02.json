    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBriefly describe the topic of the speech, identify and explain the rhetorical codes used in the speech.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe speech is about the importance of education and college entrance exams. It highlights the necessity of these exams, as they play a crucial role in students' access to higher education. The speaker stresses the value of the tests, emphasizing that they provide a competitive platform for students to showcase their abilities and secure admission to prestigious universities.\n\nThe speech uses anecdotal evidence, presenting stories of successful students who have benefited from the exams. The rhetorical code used here is the appeal to logos, which emphasizes the logical reasoning behind the necessity of entrance exams. The speaker also employs the rhetorical code of pathos by sharing personal stories, making a more emotional appeal to the audience. Moreover, the use of the rhetorical code of ethos is seen in the speech, as the speaker's authority and credibility are reinforced through the sharing of testimonials from successful students. Overall, the speech effectively utilizes a mix of logical, emotional, and ethical appeals to emphasize the importance of college entrance exams.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe topic of the speech is the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students. The speaker argues that these exams are necessary for three reasons: they ensure fairness, they help students grow, and they provide a uniform evaluation.\n\nThe rhetorical codes used in the speech include:\n\n1. **Hypophora**: The speaker asks a rhetorical question (\"Suppose there is no college entrance exam in our country, how would you get into college?\") to engage the audience and highlight the importance of the exams.\n\n2. **Anaphora**: The repetition of \"they have\" (money, parents with higher social status, better connections) emphasizes the advantages that some students have without the exams, making the case for fairness.\n\n3. **Antithesis**: The contrast between \"Your family or money doesn't help here\" and \"it's all about how much you study and what you can do\" highlights the fairness of the exams.\n\n4. **Pathos**: The speaker appeals to emotions by mentioning stories of students from poor families who studied hard to get into top universities, emphasizing the exams' role in changing lives.\n\n5. **Ethos**: The use of Einstein's quote about learning (\"learning is more than remembering facts – it's about how to use your mind\") adds credibility to the argument that the exams help students grow.\n\n6. **Metaphor**: The statement \"They’re not just tests, but keys to the future\" uses a metaphor to convey the importance of the exams in opening doors to future opportunities.\n\nThese rhetorical codes are used to effectively persuade the audience of the necessity and benefits of college entrance exams.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the speech's topic as the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.\n2. Highlight rhetorical devices used: Hypophora, Anaphora, Antithesis, Ethos, Metaphor.\n3.
