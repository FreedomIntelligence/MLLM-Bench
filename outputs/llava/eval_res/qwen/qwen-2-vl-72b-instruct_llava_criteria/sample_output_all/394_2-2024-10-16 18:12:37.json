    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend prediction image, determine the trend shown in the image is reasonable.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a humorous and exaggerated trend prediction of chickens evolving over time. Here is a detailed analysis of the trend shown in the image:\n\n1. **1957**: The chicken appears small and thin, typical of chickens from the mid-20th century.\n2. **1978**: The chicken is larger and more robust, indicating growth in size over the years.\n3. **2005**: The chicken is even larger and more plump, showing a continued increase in size.\n4. **2008**: The chicken has developed a small tail, suggesting a mutation or evolutionary change.\n5. **2011**: The chicken has a more pronounced tail, further developing the mutation.\n6. **2015**: The chicken has a larger, more dinosaur-like tail, continuing the evolutionary trend.\n7. **2019**: The chicken has developed a more dinosaur-like body structure, with a larger tail and more robust legs.\n8. **2025**: The chicken has evolved into a T-Rex, a prehistoric dinosaur.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Reasonableness**: The trend shown in the image is not scientifically reasonable. Chickens are domesticated birds and do not evolve into dinosaurs. The image is a humorous and exaggerated representation, not a realistic prediction.\n- **Evolutionary Biology**: Evolutionary changes occur over millions of years and involve gradual genetic modifications. The image suggests a rapid and unrealistic transformation.\n- **Scientific Accuracy**: There is no scientific basis for chickens evolving into dinosaurs within a few decades. The image is intended to be a joke, not a factual representation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe trend prediction in the image is not reasonable from a scientific perspective. It is meant to be humorous and should not be taken as a factual or realistic evolutionary trend.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the size of chickens over time. The image features a graph with several chicken sizes, including an oversized chicken, dinosaurs, and a rooster that has impregnated a dinosaur. The trend is presented in a humorous and exaggerated manner, showing chickens growing in size to become like dinosaurs.\n\nThe trend is likely a fantasy or a parody, as it is unrealistic for chickens to grow to the size of dinosaurs in actuality. The graph and the rooster impregnating a dinosaur are not scientifically plausible, and therefore, the trend is not reasonable. The image is meant to be humorous and entertaining, rather than providing accurate information about the growth of chickens over time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the answer identifies the trend as unreasonable.\n2. Assess the logical explanation for why the trend is unreasonable.\n3. Evaluate the consistency of the answer with the image's content.",
