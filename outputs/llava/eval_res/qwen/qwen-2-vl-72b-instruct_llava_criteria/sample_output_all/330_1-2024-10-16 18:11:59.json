    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a scene of significant destruction, with multiple buildings severely damaged or collapsed, and debris scattered throughout the area. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in protective gear suggests that this is a disaster response operation, likely following a natural disaster such as an earthquake, landslide, or flood.\n\nThe extent of the damage, including the collapse of structures and the widespread debris, indicates that the disaster was both intense and sudden. The structural remnants suggest that the buildings were unable to withstand the forces exerted upon them, leading to their collapse. This level of destruction typically occurs during high-magnitude earthquakes or powerful landslides.\n\nGiven the scale of the damage and the ongoing rescue efforts, it is likely that the disaster occurred relatively recently, as the rescue operation is still active. The intensity of the event can be inferred to be very high, given the extensive damage to the buildings and the need for a large-scale rescue effort.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
