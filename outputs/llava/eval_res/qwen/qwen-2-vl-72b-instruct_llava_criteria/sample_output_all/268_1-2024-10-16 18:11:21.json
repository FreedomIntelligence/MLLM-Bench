    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe circuit board in the picture appears to have sustained significant damage, which likely renders it unusable. Here are some possible reasons for the damage:\n\n1. **Overheating**: The blackened and melted area around the components suggests that there was excessive heat, possibly due to a short circuit or an overload. This can cause components to fail and the board to become damaged.\n\n2. **Short Circuit**: A short circuit can cause a sudden surge of current, leading to overheating and potentially melting of components and traces on the board.\n\n3. **Component Failure**: One or more components may have failed catastrophically, leading to the damage seen. For example, a capacitor or resistor might have failed and caused a short circuit or overheating.\n\n4. **Improper Soldering**: Poor soldering techniques can lead to weak connections, which can fail under normal operation, causing a short circuit or overheating.\n\n5. **External Damage**: The board might have been physically damaged by an external force, leading to a short circuit or other electrical failures.\n\n6. **Design Flaw**: There might be a design flaw in the circuit that caused components to fail under normal operating conditions.\n\nTo determine the exact cause, a more detailed inspection and analysis would be necessary, possibly involving electrical testing and a closer look at the failed components.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
