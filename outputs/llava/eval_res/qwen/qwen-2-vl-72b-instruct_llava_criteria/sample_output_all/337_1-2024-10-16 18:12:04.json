    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nObserve debris-clearing methods and safety gear to gauge rescue safety and efficiency.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image presents a scene of a child standing amidst a pile of rubble in a city, possibly after a natural disaster or a collapsing structure. In the process of clearing debris, several people can be seen, including one person standing in the middle and others surrounding the pile. However, we cannot easily identify any specific safety gear or debris-clearing methods being used.\n\nThe presence of the child and people around the pile indicates a sense of urgency and concern for the safety of those involved in the rescue efforts. To better understand the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation, one would want to observe the use of safety gear, such as helmets and protective clothing, and the implementation of proper debris-clearing methods, such as the use of specialized equipment or the organization of a coordinated rescue team.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a scene of extensive destruction with numerous debris scattered across the area. The debris includes various materials such as metal sheets, wood, and other unidentifiable objects. The area appears to be heavily damaged, possibly due to a natural disaster or a large-scale accident.\n\nTo gauge rescue safety and efficiency, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. **Debris-Clearing Methods**:\n   - The debris is spread out and appears to be in a chaotic state, indicating that systematic clearing has not yet begun.\n   - There is no visible heavy machinery or equipment present, suggesting that the clearing process may be in its initial stages or has not started yet.\n\n2. **Safety Gear**:\n   - There is a person visible in the image, standing amidst the debris. This person is wearing a yellow top, which could be part of safety gear.\n   - However, it is unclear if this individual is a rescue worker or a bystander. There are no other visible rescue workers or safety gear in the image.\n\n3. **Rescue Safety and Efficiency**:\n   - The lack of visible rescue workers or safety gear suggests that the rescue operation may not have fully commenced.\n   - The presence of only one individual amidst the debris raises concerns about safety, as the area appears hazardous due to the scattered and potentially unstable debris.\n   - Efficient rescue operations typically involve coordinated efforts with specialized equipment and trained personnel, none of which are evident in this image.\n\nOverall, the image suggests that the rescue operation is either in its very early stages or has not yet begun, and there are concerns about safety due to the lack of visible safety gear and rescue personnel.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible safety gear worn by individuals in the image.\n2. Describe observable debris-clearing methods or equipment.\n3. Assess the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation depicted.",
