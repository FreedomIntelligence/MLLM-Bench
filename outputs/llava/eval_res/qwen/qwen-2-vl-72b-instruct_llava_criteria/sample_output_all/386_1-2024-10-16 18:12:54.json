    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues in the image, what will be the possible action of the driver?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nLooking at the visual cues, the driver is likely to follow the directions displayed on the phone, possibly to find a specific destination or to reach a nearby place. The driver is holding the cell phone in the car, and it is connected to a dash mount, which suggests that they will be using the phone's navigation system for guidance. The driver is responsible for safely maintaining their attention on the road while relying on this system to navigate the city.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the visual cues in the image, the driver appears to be following a navigation route on the smartphone mounted on the dashboard. The driver's hands are on the steering wheel, and the car is moving forward, as indicated by the blurred background and the position of the car on the road. The driver is likely to continue driving along the route indicated by the navigation app, possibly heading towards a specific destination.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes \"slow down till stop\" or \"turn left to adjacent lane\" based on visual cues.\n2. Response must consider traffic conditions and road layout visible in the image.\n3. Answer must be logically consistent with the driver's possible actions in the given context.",
