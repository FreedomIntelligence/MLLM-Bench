Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19 antigens. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result. The \"C\" line is the control line, which should always appear to confirm that the test is working properly. The \"T\" line is the test line, and its presence indicates that the test has detected COVID-19 antigens in the sample, suggesting an active infection.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
