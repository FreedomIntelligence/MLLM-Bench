    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe animal in the picture is a fish, specifically a type of parrotfish. Here are some detailed features to help identify it:\n\n1. **Coloration**: The fish has a predominantly green body with hints of blue and yellow. The coloration is vibrant and varies across its body, with the green being more prominent on the head and sides.\n\n2. **Shape and Structure**: The fish has a robust, somewhat boxy body shape typical of parrotfish. It has a prominent, rounded head with a beak-like mouth, which is used for scraping algae off rocks.\n\n3. **Fins**: The fish has well-developed fins. The dorsal fin is tall and extends from the middle of the back to the tail. The anal fin is also prominent and extends from the belly to the tail. The pectoral fins (side fins) are relatively small and transparent.\n\n4. **Eyes**: The eyes are relatively large and positioned on the sides of the head, allowing for a wide field of vision.\n\n5. **Mouth**: The mouth is unique and beak-like, which is a characteristic feature of parrotfish. This beak is used to grind up coral and other hard substrates.\n\n6. **Tail**: The tail is rounded and has a dark coloration, which contrasts with the lighter body.\n\n7. **Environment**: The fish is in an aquatic environment, likely an aquarium or a marine habitat, as indicated by the glass barrier and the underwater setting.\n\nThese features collectively help in identifying the fish as a parrotfish, which is known for its colorful appearance and unique feeding habits.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
