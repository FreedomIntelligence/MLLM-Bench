    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe indoor space depicted in the image is a gallery within a museum, likely designed in the neoclassical architectural style. This style is characterized by its grandeur, symmetry, and the use of classical elements such as columns, pilasters, and ornate decorations. The high ceilings, large windows, and the arrangement of large paintings on the walls are typical features of neoclassical design, which aims to create a sense of awe and reverence for the artworks displayed.\n\nThe cultural function of this space is to serve as an exhibition area for art, particularly paintings. The setting is designed to provide visitors with an environment that enhances their appreciation and understanding of the artworks. The benches and the open, spacious layout allow visitors to comfortably view and contemplate the art, fostering an educational and reflective experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
