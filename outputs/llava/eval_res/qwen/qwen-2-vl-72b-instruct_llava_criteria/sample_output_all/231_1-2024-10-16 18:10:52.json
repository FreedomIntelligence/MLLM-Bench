    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capital among the countries listed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo analyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed, one can refer to the image showing a scatter plot of these two variables. The x-axis represents the night light intensity, whereas the y-axis represents the GDP per capita. By observing the plot, one can determine the strength and direction of the relationship between these two factors. A positive correlation indicates that countries with higher night light intensity tend to have higher GDP per capita, while a negative correlation suggests the opposite. Additionally, if there is a significant linear relationship, it can provide insights into how night light intensity influences GDP per capita among these countries.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe table provides data on night light intensity, average value per pixel, population density, urbanization percentage, and GDP per capita for the United States, Brazil, and Madagascar. To analyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita, we can compare the average night light intensity (average value per pixel) with the GDP per capita for each country.\n\n1. **United States**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 4.66\n   - GDP per capita: $33,582\n\n2. **Brazil**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 0.63\n   - GDP per capita: $3,760\n\n3. **Madagascar**:\n   - Average night light intensity: 0.02\n   - GDP per capita: $249\n\nFrom the data:\n- The United States has the highest average night light intensity (4.66) and the highest GDP per capita ($33,582).\n- Brazil has a moderate average night light intensity (0.63) and a moderate GDP per capita ($3,760).\n- Madagascar has the lowest average night light intensity (0.02) and the lowest GDP per capita ($249).\n\n**Conclusion**: There is a strong positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed. Higher night light intensity is associated with higher GDP per capita.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Relate the night light intensity to average value per pixel.\n2. There is a positive relationship between average value per pixel (night light intensity) and GDP per capital.",
