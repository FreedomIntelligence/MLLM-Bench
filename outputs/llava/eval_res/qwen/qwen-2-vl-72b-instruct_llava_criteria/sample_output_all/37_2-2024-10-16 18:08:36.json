    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDecompose the logo into its constituent parts and based on the elements, make an hypothesis on the type of team or organization it represents.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl's'\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe logo features a shark with a scissor in its mouth. This unique combination could represent a business or organization that has a connection to the marine life (shark) and cutting-edge technology or precision (the scissor). One possible hypothesis is that the logo might represent a shark-related business, such as a diving or marine tours operator, or an aquarium or marine research facility. Alternatively, it could represent a business or organization that provides cutting-edge or precise services in an industry that is distinct from marine life, such as medical or beauty services.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all elements of the logo (e.g., shark, trident) and describe their visual characteristics.\n2. Hypothesize the type of team/organization (e.g., sports, marine) the logo represents based on elements.",
