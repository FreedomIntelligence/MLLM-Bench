    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe landmark in the picture is the Sydney Opera House, a world-renowned performing arts center located in Sydney, Australia. The architectural style of the Sydney Opera House is a unique blend of modernist and brutalist design elements, characterized by its distinctive sail-like roof structures.\n\nThe design concept behind the Sydney Opera House was created by Danish architect Jørn Utzon. The inspiration for the design reportedly came from the image of a sliced orange, with the slices representing the sails. The structure is composed of three groups of interlocking shells, each designed to provide an optimal acoustic environment for the various performance spaces within.\n\nKey features of the design include:\n1. **Sail-like Roofs**: The most striking feature of the Opera House is its series of white shell-like structures, which are actually precast concrete panels supported by an intricate steel framework.\n2. **Acoustic Considerations**: The design was intended to optimize acoustics for performances, with each shell housing different performance venues.\n3. **Integration with the Environment**: The Opera House is situated on Bennelong Point, a peninsula in Sydney Harbour, and its design was intended to harmonize with the surrounding water and natural landscape.\n4. **Innovative Engineering**: The construction of the shells required innovative engineering solutions, including the use of a unique concrete mix and a novel construction method.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is not only an architectural masterpiece but also a symbol of cultural significance and innovation. Its design has influenced numerous other buildings worldwide and remains an iconic representation of modern architecture.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
