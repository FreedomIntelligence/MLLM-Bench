    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis chart shows the global mean temperature anomalies compared to the average temperature from 1850 to 1900. The data is presented by several different datasets, including HadCRUT5, NOAAGlobalTemp, Kadow et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5. The chart indicates the following:\n\n1. **General Trend**: There is a clear upward trend in global mean temperatures over the past 150 years, particularly since the mid-20th century. This suggests that the Earth's temperature has been rising over time.\n\n2. **Magnitude of Increase**: The temperature anomalies have increased significantly since the 1980s. The most recent data points (around 2020) show anomalies reaching up to 1.4°C above the 1850-1900 average.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Datasets**: All datasets show a similar trend, indicating that the observed warming is consistent across different methods of measurement and analysis.\n\n4. **Recent Acceleration**: The rate of temperature increase appears to have accelerated in recent decades, with the most significant warming occurring in the 21st century.\n\nThis chart implies that global temperatures have been rising significantly over the past century, with the most pronounced warming occurring in recent decades. This is consistent with the findings of climate change studies, which attribute this warming to human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
