    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the answer to this expression?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe expression given is:\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{2x}{(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)^2} \\, dx \\]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let's decompose the integrand:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2x}{(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)^2} = \\frac{A}{x + 1} + \\frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 1} + \\frac{Dx + E}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator, we get:\n\n\\[ 2x = A(x^2 + 1)^2 + (Bx + C)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) + (Dx + E)(x + 1) \\]\n\nExpanding and collecting like terms, we can solve for the coefficients A, B, C, D, and E. However, this process can be quite involved and requires careful algebraic manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a computer algebra system (CAS) to find the partial fraction decomposition and then integrate each term separately. Using a CAS, we find:\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{2x}{(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)^2} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln|x + 1| + \\frac{1}{2} \\arctan(x) + \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{x}{x^2 + 1} + C \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe expression shown on the paper involves a calculation of the determinant for a 2x2 matrix, which requires a little more information to determine the answer definitively. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndet(A) = a\\_11 \\* a\\_22 - a\\_12 \\* a\\_21\n\nIn this case, it is not possible to provide the exact answer without the values of the elements of the 2x2 matrix. To find the determinant, you need to know the specific values of a\\_11, a\\_12, a\\_21, and a\\_22.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly solve the integral expression shown in the image.\n2. Matches answer: 2*(x - 1)/(4*x**2 + 4) - log(x + 1)/2 + log(x**2 + 1)/4.\n3. Explanation is mathematically sound and aligns with visual math reasoning.",
