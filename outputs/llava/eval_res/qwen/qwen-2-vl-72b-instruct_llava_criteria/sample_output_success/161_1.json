    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, summarize the abstract in one sentence and explain the significance of this article.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe abstract describes a paper that highlights the importance of democratizing chatbot development by incorporating multiple languages, including English and Chinese, to allow chatbots to communicate with users across diverse linguistic backgrounds. This can be achieved by using innovative models such as Phoenix, which can enhance the performance of chatbots while reducing the learning time required. The significance of this article lies in promoting the use of chatbots in various languages, thus providing universal access and fostering global connections.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe article presents the development of a large language model called \"Phoenix\" that aims to democratize ChatGPT across multiple languages, including those with limited resources, making it more accessible globally. This work is significant because it addresses the accessibility issues of ChatGPT in regions where its use is restricted, thereby expanding its reach and utility.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Summarize the abstract in one sentence, mentioning 'Phoenix', 'democratize ChatGPT', and 'languages'.\n2. Explain the significance, focusing on accessibility in 'resource-limited' areas and 'non-Latin languages'.",
