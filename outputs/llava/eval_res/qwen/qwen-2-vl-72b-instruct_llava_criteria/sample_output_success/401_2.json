    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the elements in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a seamless floral pattern that features an array of colorful flowers and leaves against a dark, possibly greenish-blue background. The flowers are intricately designed with multiple layers of petals, showcasing a variety of colors including red, yellow, orange, and white. Each flower has a distinct shape and style, contributing to the overall complexity and richness of the pattern.\n\nThe leaves are also detailed, with varying shapes and sizes. Some leaves are elongated and pointed, while others are more rounded and broad. The leaves are primarily green, with some having subtle shading that gives them a more three-dimensional appearance. The arrangement of the flowers and leaves is organic and natural, creating a sense of flow and movement across the pattern.\n\nThe flowers are primarily clustered together in groups, with some branches extending outwards to create a sense of depth. The branches are thin and delicate, with small nodes where leaves and flowers sprout. The overall effect is one of lush, abundant foliage, reminiscent of a dense garden or forest.\n\nIn terms of design and style, the pattern appears to be inspired by traditional floral motifs, possibly with influences from Art Nouveau or Victorian styles, given the intricate and detailed nature of the flowers and leaves. The use of a dark background helps to make the colors of the flowers and leaves stand out more vividly, creating a striking contrast.\n\nThis pattern could be used for a variety of applications, such as textiles, wallpaper, packaging, or other decorative purposes. The seamless nature of the pattern means it can be tiled endlessly without any visible breaks or interruptions, making it versatile and easy to work with in various design contexts.\n\nIn summary, the image is a vibrant and detailed floral pattern featuring a mix of colorful flowers and green leaves on a dark background. The intricate design and organic arrangement of the elements create a visually appealing and versatile pattern suitable for various decorative uses.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a bright, vibrant floral pattern with various colors and decorative elements. The design creates a cheerful and lively atmosphere. The pattern is composed of numerous flowers, some larger and more prominent, while others are smaller and situated throughout the image.\n\nIn addition to the flowers, there is a bird flying through the air, adding an intriguing element to the scene. The combination of the flowers, the bird, and the vibrant colors makes the image visually appealing and captivating.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the variety of flowers and leaves, noting colors and patterns.\n2. Describe the overall design and repetition in the floral pattern.\n3.
