    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the area around the wooden desk and chair, which is centrally located in the room. Here are the reasons for this choice:\n\n1. **Furniture Arrangement**: The desk and chair are already set up in a way that suggests a workspace. The desk has a lamp, books, and other office-related items, indicating that it is already being used as an office space.\n\n2. **Lighting**: The area is well-lit, with a lamp on the desk and natural light coming in from the window. Good lighting is essential for an office space to reduce eye strain and improve productivity.\n\n3. **Privacy and Focus**: The desk is positioned against the wall, providing a sense of privacy and minimizing distractions. This setup is conducive to focused work.\n\n4. **Accessibility**: The desk is centrally located, making it easily accessible from other parts of the room. This is important for an office space to ensure that it is convenient to use throughout the day.\n\n5. **Storage**: The shelves above the desk provide additional storage space for office supplies and documents, which is essential for keeping the workspace organized.\n\nOverall, the area around the wooden desk and chair is the most suitable location for an office space due to its existing setup, lighting, privacy, accessibility, and storage options.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
