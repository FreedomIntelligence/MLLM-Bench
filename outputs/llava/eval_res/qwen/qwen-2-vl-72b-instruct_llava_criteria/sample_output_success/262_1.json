    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the picture, the people are covering their faces with veils, likely due to the presence of a sandstorm or dust storm. Sandstorms are common in desert regions and occur when strong winds pick up loose sand and dust from the ground, creating a cloud of particles that can be hazardous to breathe in. The veils serve as a protective measure to prevent sand and dust from entering their eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nThe reasons for this weather occurrence include:\n1. **Dry and Arid Conditions**: Deserts and semi-arid regions are prone to sandstorms because they lack vegetation to anchor the soil and reduce wind erosion.\n2. **Strong Winds**: When strong winds blow over dry, loose soil, they can easily pick up and carry sand and dust particles.\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change can exacerbate desertification, making the land drier and more susceptible to sandstorms.\n4. **Human Activity**: Overgrazing, deforestation, and other human activities can also contribute to the degradation of the land, making it more prone to sandstorms.\n\nOverall, the people in the picture are taking necessary precautions to protect themselves from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
