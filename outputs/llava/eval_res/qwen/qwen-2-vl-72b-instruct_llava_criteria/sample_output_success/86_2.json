    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the scenery in the image in detail, where is this image been shot, what time does this image is been shot, and other information that could be helpful for others to recognize this image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a stunning night sky with a prominent star trail effect, indicating a long exposure photograph. The stars appear as circular streaks, centered around the celestial pole, which suggests that the photograph was taken in the Northern Hemisphere. The sky has a gradient of colors, transitioning from a deep blue at the top to a lighter hue near the horizon.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a traditional East Asian pagoda, likely a temple or a watchtower, perched on a mountainous landscape. The architecture is characterized by its tiered, upturned eaves and intricate details, typical of historical structures in countries like China, Japan, or Korea. The pagoda is illuminated, standing out against the dark, forested surroundings.\n\nThe time of the photograph is likely nighttime, as indicated by the dark sky and the star trails. The presence of the star trails also suggests that the exposure time was quite long, possibly several hours. The lighting on the pagoda and the surrounding landscape appears to be artificial, possibly from nearby lights or a light source within the pagoda itself.\n\nGiven the architectural style and the natural surroundings, this image could have been taken in a mountainous region in East Asia, possibly in a national park or a historical site. The specific location is not immediately identifiable from the image alone, but it is likely a place known for its scenic beauty and cultural significance.\n\nOverall, this image captures the serene beauty of a starry night in a mountainous region, with the traditional architecture of the pagoda adding a cultural and historical aspect to the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a picturesque night scene dominated by a tall building in the midst of a forest. The building is situated atop a hill, and the sky above it is filled with a starry night display. The scene looks like it's located in a mountainous area, with trees surrounding the building and the star-filled sky serving as a backdrop. The nighttime setting is enhanced by the presence of several bright stars that create a mesmerizing atmosphere.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the scenery elements: star trails, pagoda, trees, and mountains.\n2. Determine and state the likely time of day: night, with reference to star trails.\n3. Provide contextual clues for location recognition without specifying the exact place.",
