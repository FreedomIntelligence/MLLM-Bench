    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat would be the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image? The image size is 1300*1300\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n[0.41, 0.05, 0.76, 0.28]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image, we need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of the strawberry relative to the image size (1300x1300).\n\n1. **Top-Left Corner (x1, y1)**:\n   - The strawberry is located towards the top-left of the image.\n   - Let's estimate the coordinates to be around (200, 100).\n\n2. **Bottom-Right Corner (x2, y2)**:\n   - The strawberry extends towards the center-right of the image.\n   - Let's estimate the coordinates to be around (600, 300).\n\nSo, the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry would be approximately:\n- **Top-Left Corner (x1, y1)**: (200, 100)\n- **Bottom-Right Corner (x2, y2)**: (600, 300)\n\nThus, the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry are (200, 100, 600, 300).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of the strawberry's bounding box coordinates.\n2. Bounding box should tightly enclose the entire strawberry.\n3. Coordinates must be accurate relative to the image's dimensions.",
