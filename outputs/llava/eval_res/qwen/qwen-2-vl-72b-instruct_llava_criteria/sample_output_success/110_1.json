    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, three individuals are dressed in traditional attire, suggesting a cultural or ceremonial context. The person seated in the center appears to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly a leader or a person of high status, given the central placement and the elaborate nature of the setting. The seated individual has a composed and confident expression, which aligns with the role of a leader or a person of significance.\n\nThe two standing individuals on either side have neutral to slightly smiling expressions, indicating a sense of respect or deference to the person seated. Their body language, with hands resting on the table, suggests a formal and respectful posture, reinforcing the hierarchical dynamic present in the image.\n\nOverall, the facial expressions and body language of the subjects convey a formal and respectful atmosphere, with the central figure likely holding a position of authority or importance within the context of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
