    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the image quality, and determine the possible cause of the blurriness.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality is poor, with a lot of blurriness due to the fuzzy coral and an unclear underwater view. There are many factors that could contribute to poor image quality, including the distance from the subject, camera settings, water clarity, or even the condition of the camera itself. The blurriness may not allow for a detailed examination of the coral reef structure, which could provide valuable information about marine life and ecosystems. It is essential to ensure that future underwater images are of high quality for more accurate identification and understanding of marine environments.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe overall clarity of this image is low, with some noticeable noise and a general blurriness. The texture details of the main subject, the underwater reef, are partially lost. The color of the image is predominantly blue. The background of the picture is not very clear. Therefore, the quality of this image is poor. The blurriness may be caused by the underwater shooting conditions, which can result in a loss of detail and clarity.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess sharpness and clarity; mention if image details are distinguishable.\n2. Identify potential causes of blurriness, such as camera motion or water distortion.\n3. Evaluate color fidelity and noise levels, considering underwater lighting conditions.",
