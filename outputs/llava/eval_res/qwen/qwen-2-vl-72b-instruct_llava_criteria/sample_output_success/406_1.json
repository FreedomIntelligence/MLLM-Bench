    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features an orange tabby cat lying on a flat surface, likely concrete or pavement, in an outdoor setting. The cat has a relaxed posture, with its body stretched out and its head resting on its front paws. The fur of the cat is a warm, golden-orange color with darker orange stripes, typical of a tabby pattern.\n\nIn the background, there is a modern building with a series of windows and a large glass door. The building has a clean, architectural design with white and gray elements. There are also some black vertical structures, possibly part of the building's design or support beams, visible in the image. The lighting suggests it is daytime, with sunlight casting shadows on the ground, indicating a bright and sunny environment. The overall atmosphere appears calm and serene, with the cat enjoying a moment of rest in an urban setting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
