    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humorous elements in the image include:\n\n1. **The Dog's Expression**: The dog has a very human-like expression, which is exaggerated and comical.\n2. **The Painting**: The painting is a humorous take on a classic portrait, with the dog wearing a suit and tie, which adds to the absurdity.\n3. **The Text**: The text at the top of the image sets the context, suggesting that the dog has spent money on something unnecessary, which is the painting.\n\nBackstory:\n\nThe dog, feeling flush with cash after payday, decides to indulge in a whim. Inspired by a recent visit to an art gallery, the dog decides to commission a portrait of itself. The artist, not used to painting animals, creates a comically exaggerated portrait, complete with a suit and tie. The dog, delighted with the result, proudly displays the painting in its home. The moment captured in the meme is the dog standing next to the painting, looking pleased with its purchase, despite it being a humorous and unnecessary expense.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
