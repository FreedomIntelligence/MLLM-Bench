    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotion conveyed by the statue and analyze any symbolism that might be associated with the serenity of the expression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe statue displays a serene and calm expression, as the woman's eyes are half closed, and her lips are together in a peaceful manner. This peacefulness in the statue could symbolize various aspects such as tranquility, inner peace, contentment, or even enlightenment. The statue's serene expression is likely meant to evoke a sense of calmness and harmony, encouraging viewers to connect with their own inner peace and quiet reflection. The decorative headpiece and the overall design of the statue further emphasize the harmony and balance that the figure represents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe statue in the image conveys a sense of serenity and tranquility. The closed eyes and calm expression suggest a state of peaceful meditation or deep contemplation. This serene demeanor is often associated with spiritual figures, indicating a connection to inner peace and enlightenment.\n\nSymbolically, the closed eyes can represent detachment from the material world and a focus on the spiritual realm. The crown adorned with various figures might symbolize wisdom and the attainment of knowledge. The overall posture and attire, including the robe and necklace, further emphasize a sense of reverence and devotion.\n\nThe serenity of the expression can be interpreted as a reflection of inner peace and the attainment of a higher state of consciousness. This is a common theme in many spiritual traditions, where the goal is to achieve a state of mind that is free from the turmoil of the external world. The statue serves as a visual representation of this ideal, inspiring viewers to seek their own path to inner tranquility and spiritual fulfillment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotion of the statue's expression as serene, peaceful, or similar.\n2. Analyze symbolism related to the statue's serenity, like attire or objects held.",
