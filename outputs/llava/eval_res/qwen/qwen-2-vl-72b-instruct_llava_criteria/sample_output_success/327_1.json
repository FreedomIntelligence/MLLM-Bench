    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happens to the images from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the two images travel from left to right, the image loses contrast, giving it a silhouette appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe images from left to right show the effects of post-processing on a photograph. \n\n- **Left Image**: This is the original, unedited photo. It appears to be underexposed, with the sky and buildings lacking detail and the overall image looking somewhat dark.\n- **Right Image**: This is the edited version of the photo. The exposure has been adjusted, making the image brighter and bringing out more detail in the sky and buildings. The contrast and color saturation also appear to have been enhanced, giving the image a more vibrant and dynamic look.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in exposure, contrast, and color balance between images.\n2. Assess sharpness, noise, and detail preservation in both images.\n3. Evaluate dynamic range, highlighting shadow and highlight detail retention.",
