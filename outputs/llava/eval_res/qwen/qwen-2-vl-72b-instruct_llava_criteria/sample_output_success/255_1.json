    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe illustration depicts four big cats, each with distinct species-specific features:\n\n1. **Tiger (top left)**:\n   - **Fur Pattern**: The tiger has a distinctive striped pattern, with a combination of orange and black stripes.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a robust body with a relatively short tail.\n   - **Mouth**: The tiger's mouth is open, showing its teeth, which is characteristic of its predatory nature.\n\n2. **Puma (top right)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The puma has a uniform tawny color, without any stripes or spots.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a sleek, muscular body with a long tail.\n   - **Mouth**: The puma's mouth is slightly open, showing its teeth.\n\n3. **Lion (bottom left)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The lion has a tawny fur color, similar to the puma, but with a more robust and heavier body.\n   - **Mane**: The most distinctive feature is the lion's mane, which is thick and dark, framing its face.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a powerful and muscular body.\n\n4. **Lioness with Cubs (bottom right)**:\n   - **Fur Color**: The lioness has a similar tawny color to the lion, but without the mane.\n   - **Body Shape**: It has a more slender body compared to the lion.\n   - **Cubs**: The lioness is depicted with two cubs, which have a similar fur color but are smaller in size.\n\nEach species is characterized by its unique fur pattern, body shape, and other physical features that help distinguish them from one another.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
