    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The different parts of the ECG waveform include:\n\n1. **P Wave**: Represents atrial depolarization.\n2. **PR Interval**: The time from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex.\n3. **QRS Complex**: Represents ventricular depolarization.\n4. **QT Interval**: The time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave.\n5. **T Wave**: Represents ventricular repolarization.\n\n### Abnormalities in the Image:\n\n1. **Sinus Tachycardia**: The heart rate is elevated, which is evident from the short RR intervals.\n2. **QRS Duration**: The QRS complex appears to be slightly prolonged, suggesting possible bundle branch block or ventricular conduction delay.\n3. **ST Segment**: There are no significant ST segment elevations or depressions.\n4. **T Waves**: The T waves appear to be inverted in leads V1 and V2, which could indicate ischemia or strain.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Rate**: The heart rate is elevated, indicating sinus tachycardia.\n- **Rhythm**: The rhythm appears to be regular.\n- **P Waves**: Present and consistent, indicating sinus rhythm.\n- **PR Interval**: Appears to be within normal limits.\n- **QRS Complex**: Slightly prolonged, suggesting possible conduction abnormalities.\n- **ST Segment**: No significant ST segment elevations or depressions.\n- **T Waves**: Inverted in V1 and V2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe ECG shows sinus tachycardia with possible bundle branch block or ventricular conduction delay, and inverted T waves in V1 and V2, which may indicate ischemia or strain. Further investigation and clinical correlation are necessary to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
