    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain how the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit could be perceived as humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses, to a fruit like a pineapple can be perceived as humorous for several reasons:\n\n1. **Anthropomorphism**: By giving the pineapple human-like features, it breaks the natural expectations of how a fruit should look. This can create a sense of surprise and amusement as we attribute human characteristics to an inanimate object.\n\n2. **Contrast**: The juxtaposition of a natural, organic object (the pineapple) with a man-made, human accessory (the sunglasses) creates a visual and conceptual contrast. This unexpected combination can be seen as funny because it challenges our usual perceptions.\n\n3. **Personification**: The sunglasses give the pineapple a sense of personality and character, as if it has a human-like presence. This personification can make the image more relatable and entertaining, as viewers might imagine the pineapple as having a life or personality of its own.\n\n4. **Playfulness**: The image is playful and whimsical, inviting viewers to see the humor in the absurdity of the situation. It encourages a light-hearted interpretation and can elicit a smile or a laugh.\n\nOverall, the humor arises from the blending of the natural and the artificial, the familiar and the unexpected, and the严肃 and the playful.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses and a hat, to a pineapple can be perceived as humorous because it gives the fruit a quirky and amusing appearance. This unconventional combination of a fruit and human-like accessories can be seen as a playful statement and may evoke laughter or amusement in viewers. The image of the pineapple with sunglasses lying on a bed on a blanket adds to the lighthearted and comical nature of the scene, as it is an atypical, whimsical depiction of a commonly seen object.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the accessory (sunglasses) and its typical human use.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing fruit by accessorizing.\n3. Discuss the incongruity between the pineapple and sunglasses.",
