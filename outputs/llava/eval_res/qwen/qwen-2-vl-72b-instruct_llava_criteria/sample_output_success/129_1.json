    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the intensity of the emotion on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and justify the assessment based on visual cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe intensity of the emotion on this angry face can be assessed as severe. The visual cues indicating this level of intensity include the character's wide-opened eyes, furrowed brow, and tightly clenched teeth as they make a face of anger and frustration. The red color of the character's face also contributes to the intensity of the expression, as red is often associated with strong emotions or danger. Overall, these visual cues give the impression of a highly intense and severe emotional state.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe emotion depicted in the image is severe anger. This assessment is based on several visual cues:\n\n1. **Facial Expression**: The character has a furrowed brow, tightly clenched jaw, and a grimace, which are all classic indicators of intense anger.\n2. **Body Language**: The character's posture is rigid and tense, suggesting a high level of frustration or anger.\n3. **Color**: The character is predominantly red, which is often associated with anger in visual media.\n\nThese elements combined suggest that the character is experiencing a strong, intense emotion of anger.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the identified emotion matches the character's facial expression (e.g., angry, frustrated).\n2. Rate the intensity of the emotion as moderate, or severe.",
