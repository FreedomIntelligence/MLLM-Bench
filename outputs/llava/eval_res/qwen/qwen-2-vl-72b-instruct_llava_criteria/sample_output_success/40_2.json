    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of mushroom is it in the image? Is it edible?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe mushrooms in the image are likely to be species of Psilocybe, commonly known as \"magic mushrooms.\" These mushrooms are known for their psychoactive properties due to the presence of psilocybin and psilocin. \n\nIt's important to note that while some species of Psilocybe are consumed for their psychoactive effects, not all species are safe to eat. Some can be toxic or even deadly. Identification of wild mushrooms should always be done by an expert, and it is generally advised not to consume wild mushrooms unless you are certain of their identity and safety.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white mushrooms growing on top of a rock. It is not possible to definitively determine if these mushrooms are edible or not just based on the image. However, a proper identification could be done if more characteristics like the mushroom's shape, texture, and presence of any gills or pores were visible. Generally, it is advisable to avoid consuming wild mushrooms without proper identification due to the risk of consuming toxic or harmful species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify mushroom as \"galerina marginata.\"\n2. State the mushroom is not edible.\n3. Ensure the answer is based on visual characteristics of the mushroom in the image.",
