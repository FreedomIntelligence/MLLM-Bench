    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nOut of the three remaining pieces, which one should you select to place in the second row and first column?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo solve the puzzle, we need to determine the value of each fruit based on the given equations:\n\n1. \\( \\text{Apple} + \\text{Apple} = 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\text{Apple} + \\text{Apple} + \\text{Apple} = 4 \\)\n3. \\( \\text{Apple} + \\text{Bananas} = 7 \\)\n\nLet's denote:\n- Apple as \\( A \\)\n- Bananas as \\( B \\)\n- Strawberry as \\( S \\)\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[ A + A = 2 \\]\n\\[ 2A = 2 \\]\n\\[ A = 1 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ A + A + A = 4 \\]\n\\[ 3A = 4 \\]\n\\[ A = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( A \\) must be the same in both equations, we can conclude that the first equation is more reliable. Therefore, \\( A = 1 \\).\n\nFrom the third equation:\n\\[ A + B = 7 \\]\n\\[ 1 + B = 7 \\]\n\\[ B = 6 \\]\n\nNow, we need to place the strawberry in the second row and first column. The strawberry should be placed in the puzzle piece that matches the strawberry icon.\n\nSo, the correct piece to select is the one with the strawberry icon.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSince the image shows an arithmetic puzzle with three pieces left to solve, one should choose the piece that represents the number \"2,\" which is the number in the second row, and the first column, counting from the bottom left. The number \"2\" is associated with bananas, as shown in the puzzle. So, select the banana piece to complete the second row and first column.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies all pieces in their correct location: banana at the second row, first column; strawberry at the third row, first column; \"=7\" at the third row, third column.\n2. Solve the equations with the completed puzzle: apple=1, banana=3, strawberry=4.\n3. Answer to the question is (1*1+3*3)*2*4=80.",
