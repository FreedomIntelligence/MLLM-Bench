    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the details in the image and determine the gestational age of the fetus by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) and comparing it to standard growth charts.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image provided is a computed tomography (CT) scan of a thoracic region, not a ultrasound image of a fetus. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the gestational age of a fetus from this image. CT scans are typically used to visualize internal structures such as bones, blood vessels, and organs, and are not the appropriate imaging modality for measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) of a fetus.\n\nTo determine the gestational age of a fetus, an ultrasound scan is typically used, and the CRL is measured from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). This measurement is then compared to standard growth charts to estimate the gestational age.\n\nIf you have an ultrasound image of a fetus, please provide that image, and I can assist with measuring the CRL and estimating the gestational age.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a black and white view of a pregnant human uterus, with multiple sections visible. A blue ball, representing the fetus, is inside the uterus. To determine the gestational age of the fetus, we can calculate the crown-rump length (CRL). The CRL measures the distance from the top of the fetal head (crown) to the end of the tailbone (rump).\n\nComparing the CRL measurement to standard growth charts, which usually have a scale starting from week 6 and ending at week 40, one can determine the gestational age. For instance, if the CRL is approximately 4 centimeters, it would indicate that the fetus is likely at around 18 weeks of gestation. However, it is important to note that the exact gestational age can only be determined by a healthcare provider through ultrasound or other methods.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the image, noting it's a CT scan, not an ultrasound for CRL measurement.\n2. Explain that CRL is used for gestational age, but not applicable in this CT image.\n3. State that gestational age cannot be determined from the provided CT image.",
