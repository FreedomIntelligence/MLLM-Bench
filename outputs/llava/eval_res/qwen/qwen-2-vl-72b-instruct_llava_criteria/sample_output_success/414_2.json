    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a dense caption detailing the various constellations depicted in the historical star map, including their names, the shapes they are associated with, and any notable stars or celestial objects contained within them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis historical star map, known as the \"Planisphaerium,\" features a detailed depiction of various constellations in the night sky. The map is oriented with the celestial equator running horizontally across the center, and the constellations are illustrated in a traditional artistic style, often anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. \n\nFrom left to right, top to bottom, the constellations and their associated shapes include:\n\n1. **Pisces (The Fish)**: Depicted as two fish with a line connecting their tails.\n2. **Aries (The Ram)**: Shown as a ram with prominent horns.\n3. **Taurus (The Bull)**: Illustrated as a bull with a fierce expression.\n4. **Gemini (The Twins)**: Represented as two young men, Castor and Pollux.\n5. **Cancer (The Crab)**: Depicted as a crab with claws.\n6. **Leo (The Lion)**: Shown as a lion with a mane.\n7. **Virgo (The Virgin)**: Illustrated as a woman, often holding a sheaf of wheat.\n8. **Libra (The Scales)**: Depicted as a set of scales.\n9. **Scorpius (The Scorpion)**: Shown as a scorpion with a curved tail.\n10. **Sagittarius (The Archer)**: Illustrated as a centaur with a bow and arrow.\n11. **Capricornus (The Sea-Goat)**: Depicted as a goat with a fish tail.\n12. **Aquarius (The Water-Bearer)**: Shown as a man pouring water from a jar.\n\nNotable stars and celestial objects within these constellations include:\n\n- **Polaris**: The North Star, located in the constellation Ursa Minor, which is not fully visible in this map but is implied by the orientation.\n- **Aldebaran**: The brightest star in Taurus, often associated with the eye of the bull.\n- **Betelgeuse**: A red supergiant star in the constellation Orion, which is not depicted in this map but is a well-known celestial object.\n- **Rigel**: A bright blue-white supergiant star in the constellation Orion, similarly not depicted in this map.\n\nThe map also includes various lines and labels indicating the positions of stars and the boundaries of the constellations. The text at the top and bottom provides additional information about the map's orientation and the celestial coordinates.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe historical star map depicts various constellations in a large circle. These constellations are named after the celestial objects they represent or are associated with. Some of the constellations include Orion, which is known for its prominent hunter figure with a shield and club. Another notable constellation is Cetus, which is shaped like a sea monster and contains the star Mirach. Additionally, there is Lepus, a small constellation situated near Orion, with a hare as its mascot. The diverse shapes and names of the constellations, along with the inclusion of notable stars like Mirach, make this historical star map fascinating and a testament to the rich history of celestial observations and cataloguing.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify constellations by name and describe their shapes accurately.\n2. Mention any notable stars or celestial objects within the constellations.\n3. Ensure the description is detailed, reflecting the historical context of the star map.",
