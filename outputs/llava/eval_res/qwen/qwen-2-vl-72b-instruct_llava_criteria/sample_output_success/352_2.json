    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo has been edited and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe photo appears to be unedited. Here are some observations that support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Natural Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting is consistent with natural daylight, and the shadows cast by the objects (such as the squirrel and the bus) are appropriate for the time of day, suggesting that the image was taken without artificial lighting or manipulation.\n\n2. **Details and Textures**: The textures of the sidewalk, road, and surrounding environment (e.g., grass, trees, and building) are clear and detailed, indicating that the image was not altered to smooth out or enhance these textures artificially.\n\n3. **Perspective and Proportions**: The perspective and proportions of the objects in the image (e.g., the squirrel, sidewalk, and bus) are consistent with what one would expect in a real-world scenario, suggesting that the image was not manipulated to alter the size or position of these objects.\n\n4. **Color Balance**: The colors in the image appear natural and balanced. There are no overly saturated or unnatural color tones that would suggest post-processing or editing.\n\n5. **Background and Foreground**: The background and foreground elements blend seamlessly, with no visible edges or inconsistencies that would indicate the addition or removal of elements.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a natural, unedited photograph taken in an outdoor setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the photo has been edited to appear as though there are two cute little faux foxes playing on the side of the brick walkway. In reality, there is only one fox figure located in the grass near the wall. The second fox figure is an altered photo with the face of the fox added later to create the illusion of two foxes playing. This playful and creative editing gives the scene a whimsical and charming appearance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the photo is edited by identifying the added squirrel.\n2. Evaluate the explanation of how the squirrel's integration indicates editing.\n3. Assess the consistency of lighting and shadows related to the squirrel.",
