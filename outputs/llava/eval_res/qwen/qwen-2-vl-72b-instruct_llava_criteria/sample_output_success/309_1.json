    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the container in the top left corner in the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, will people likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle containing boiling water at 100°C without using proper protective measures like oven mitts or a thick towel. The hot water can cause burns to their hands, especially if the bottle is made of a heat-conductive material, such as plastic. It is important to handle hot containers with care and use appropriate protective equipment to avoid accidents and injuries.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIf the container in the top left corner of the picture, which appears to be a tumbler with a lid, is filled with boiling water at 100°C, there is a risk that people might be scalded if they hold the bottle without any precautions. Boiling water can cause severe burns upon contact with skin. However, the risk can be mitigated by:\n\n1. **Using a Heat-Resistant Sleeve or Holder:** Many tumblers come with heat-resistant sleeves or holders that can be used to protect hands from the heat.\n2. **Waiting for the Water to Cool:** Allowing the water to cool down to a safer temperature before handling the tumbler can significantly reduce the risk of burns.\n3. **Using Insulated Tumblers:** Some tumblers are specifically designed with insulation to keep hot liquids hot and protect the hands from the heat.\n\nIf these precautions are taken, the risk of scalding can be minimized.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference the insulated nature of the bottle and the unlikelihood of scalding.\n2. Include reasoning on the physical properties of insulation.",
