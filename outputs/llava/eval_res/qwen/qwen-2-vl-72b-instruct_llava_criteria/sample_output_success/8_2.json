    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and describe its usage.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the image is a projector. Projectors are devices used to display images or videos on a larger surface, such as a screen or wall. They work by projecting light through a lens system, which then reflects or transmits the image onto the surface. This is commonly used in settings like classrooms, conference rooms, and home theaters to show presentations, movies, or other visual content.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a large lens, possibly the eyepiece of a projector, mounted on a ceiling. The lens is situated next to a fan, suggesting that it is likely connected to a projector unit, which is used for displaying images or videos onto a screen or surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a projector.\n2. Describe the projector's usage, such as displaying images or videos.",
