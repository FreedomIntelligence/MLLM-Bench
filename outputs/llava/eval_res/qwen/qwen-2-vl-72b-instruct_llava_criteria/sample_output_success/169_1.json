    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe instructions for how to properly open a new book are as follows:\n\n1. **Place the book with its back on a table.**\n2. **Let the front cover down.**\n3. **Then the back cover.**\n4. **Then open a few leaves in front.**\n5. **Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached.**\n6. **Do this two or three times in order to limber up the binding.**\n\nThe instructions emphasize the importance of not forcing the back cover and treating the book gently, comparing it to how a machine needs lubrication.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nThe instructions are clear and detailed, providing a step-by-step guide on how to open a new book without damaging it. The use of illustrations helps to visually demonstrate the process, making it easier to understand. The additional cautionary note about not forcing the back cover and the analogy to a machine needing lubrication further emphasize the importance of gentle handling. Overall, the instructions are effective in guiding someone on how to properly open a new book to preserve its binding and longevity.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List steps to open a new book: place on table, front cover, back cover, alternate leaves, press gently, repeat if needed.\n2. Assess if instructions are clear: sequential order, simple language, easy to follow.\n3. Evaluate effectiveness: steps lead to opening without damaging the book's binding.",
