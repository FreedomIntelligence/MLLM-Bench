    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the series of actions in the image and predict the possible next action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a series of actions involving a stick figure and a ball. Here is the analysis and prediction of the next action:\n\n1. **T1**: The stick figure is pushing the ball, causing it to move.\n2. **T2**: The ball has moved further, and the stick figure is still in motion.\n3. **T3**: The ball has reached the highest point of its trajectory, and the stick figure is preparing to catch it.\n4. **T4**: The ball is descending, and the stick figure is positioned to catch it.\n5. **T5**: The stick figure has caught the ball and is now holding it.\n\n**Prediction for the next action (T6)**:\nAfter catching the ball, the stick figure is likely to either throw the ball again or place it down. Given the sequence, it seems more likely that the stick figure will throw the ball again, starting a new cycle of actions.\n\nSo, the next action (T6) is likely to be the stick figure throwing the ball again.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a series of actions, starting with a ball above each person or symbol. From this observation, it can be inferred that the possible next action might be the ball either falling or moving towards the person, symbol, or ball to initiate the next action of the sequence. The current actions in the image involve the interaction between the ball, persons, and symbols, suggesting that this scene might be a representation of a sports game, gymnastics, or a martial arts performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the sequence of actions leading up to the last depicted moment.\n2. Predict the next action based on the momentum and position of figures.\n3. Ensure prediction is plausible within the context of the image sequence.",
