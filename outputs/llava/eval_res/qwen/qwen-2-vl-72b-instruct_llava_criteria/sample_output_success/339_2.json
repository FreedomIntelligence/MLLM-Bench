    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe computer screen in the picture appears to have significant damage, with multiple cracks radiating from a central point. Here are some possible ways to repair it:\n\n1. **Professional Repair:**\n   - **Screen Replacement:** The most common and effective solution is to replace the entire screen assembly. This involves removing the damaged screen and installing a new one. This task is best left to a professional technician who has experience with the specific model of the computer.\n\n2. **DIY Repair:**\n   - **Screen Replacement Kit:** If you are comfortable with DIY repairs, you can purchase a screen replacement kit that includes the necessary tools and replacement screen. However, this requires careful handling and some technical knowledge to avoid further damage.\n\n3. **Adhesive Repair:**\n   - **Screen Protector Adhesive:** There are some adhesive products available that can be applied to the screen to cover up the cracks. This is a temporary solution and does not restore the functionality of the screen but can prevent further damage.\n\n4. **Software Calibration:**\n   - **Display Calibration:** If the screen is still functional despite the cracks, you can try calibrating the display settings to bypass the affected areas. This might not be a complete fix but can help in using the computer temporarily.\n\n5. **Professional Assessment:**\n   - **Technical Evaluation:** Before attempting any repair, it's advisable to have the computer assessed by a professional to determine the extent of the damage and whether other components might also be affected.\n\nIn summary, the most reliable solution would be to replace the screen assembly, either by a professional or through a DIY kit if you have the necessary skills.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the extent and location of the screen damage.\n2. Suggest realistic repair methods for the identified damage.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the instruction's focus on evaluation and repair.",
