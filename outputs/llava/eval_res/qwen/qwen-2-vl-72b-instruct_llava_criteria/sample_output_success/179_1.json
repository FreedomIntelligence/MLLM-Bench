Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nFind the bounding box of the dog. The image size is 1300*923\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n[0.12, 0.42, 0.37, 0.81]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bounding box for the dog in the image can be defined as follows:\n\n- Top-left corner: (140, 440)\n- Bottom-right corner: (320, 820)\n\nThese coordinates are approximate and based on visual estimation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify and outline the dog's entire form within the image.\n2. Exclude any non-dog elements from the bounding box.\n3. Ensure the bounding box is the correct size and shape for the dog's position.",
