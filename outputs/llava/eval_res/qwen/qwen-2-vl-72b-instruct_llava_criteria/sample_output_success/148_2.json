    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image is derived from the juxtaposition of the text \"MONDAYS...\" with the image of a cat curled up and sleeping. The text suggests a common sentiment about Monday being a day that many people dread or find difficult to get through. The cat, being curled up and seemingly asleep, symbolizes a state of rest or avoidance, which humorously implies that even cats would rather avoid the challenges of Monday. The elements that contribute to the joke are:\n\n1. **Text \"MONDAYS...\":** This sets up the expectation of a common sentiment about the difficulties of Monday.\n2. **Cat Curled Up and Sleeping:** This visual element provides a humorous contrast to the idea of facing Monday, suggesting that even cats would rather be asleep than deal with the day.\n\nTogether, these elements create a relatable and amusing image that plays on the shared experience of dreading the start of the workweek.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
