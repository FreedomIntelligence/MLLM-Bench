    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe floor plan in the image appears to be well-designed in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas. Here’s a detailed assessment:\n\n### Privacy for Bedrooms:\n1. **Master Bedroom**:\n   - Located at the top left corner of the floor plan, this room is somewhat isolated from the other bedrooms, providing additional privacy.\n   - It has its own bathroom, further enhancing privacy.\n\n2. **Bedroom (Adjacent to Master Bedroom)**:\n   - This bedroom is situated next to the Master Bedroom but is separated by a bathroom, providing a buffer zone.\n   - It also has its own bathroom, ensuring privacy.\n\n3. **Bedroom (Adjacent to Living Area)**:\n   - This bedroom is located near the living area but is still separated by walls, maintaining privacy.\n   - It shares a bathroom with the other bedroom, which is situated closer to the living area.\n\n### Accessibility to Communal Areas:\n1. **Living Area**:\n   - Centrally located, making it easily accessible from all parts of the house.\n   - It is adjacent to the dining area, facilitating easy movement between these two communal spaces.\n\n2. **Dining Area**:\n   - Positioned near the kitchen, allowing for convenient access during meal times.\n   - It is also close to the living area, promoting social interaction.\n\n3. **Kitchen**:\n   - Situated near the dining area and the store, making it practical for cooking and storage needs.\n   - It is easily accessible from the main entrance and other parts of the house.\n\n4. **Store and Prayer Room**:\n   - Located near the kitchen, making it convenient for storage of kitchen supplies and other household items.\n   - The prayer room is situated in a quiet area, providing a peaceful space for religious activities.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Privacy**: The bedrooms are well-separated from each other and from the communal areas, ensuring a good level of privacy.\n- **Accessibility**: The communal areas (living, dining, kitchen) are centrally located and easily accessible from all parts of the house, promoting a functional layout.\n\nIn summary, the floor plan effectively balances privacy for the bedrooms with accessibility to communal areas, making it a practical and well-designed layout.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
