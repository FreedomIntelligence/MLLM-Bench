    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a small, circular wound on the palm of a hand. The wound appears to be a minor cut or abrasion, with a slight reddish coloration indicating that it might be new or recently irritated.\n\nHere are some advice for caring for this wound:\n\n1. **Clean the Wound**: Gently clean the wound with mild soap and water to remove any dirt or debris. This helps prevent infection.\n\n2. **Apply Antiseptic**: After cleaning, you can apply an antiseptic solution or ointment to help prevent infection.\n\n3. **Protect the Wound**: Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or adhesive plaster to protect it from further irritation and contamination.\n\n4. **Keep it Clean and Dry**: Change the bandage daily or whenever it becomes wet or dirty to keep the wound clean and dry.\n\n5. **Monitor for Infection**: Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, pus, or if it becomes more painful. If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical attention.\n\n6. **Avoid Using the Hand**: Try to avoid using the hand excessively, especially in activities that might irritate the wound.\n\nIf the wound does not heal within a few days or shows signs of infection, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
