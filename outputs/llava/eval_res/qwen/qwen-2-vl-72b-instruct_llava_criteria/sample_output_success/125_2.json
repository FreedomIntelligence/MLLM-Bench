    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the childâ€™s behavior to infer the narrative and sentiment being portrayed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a child lying on a bed, partially covered by a blanket. The child is holding the blanket up to their face, with only their eyes and part of their forehead visible. The child's eyes are wide open, suggesting a sense of fear, anxiety, or surprise. The overall sentiment conveyed by the child's behavior is one of apprehension or unease. This could imply that the child is experiencing a frightening situation, perhaps a nightmare or a scary story, leading them to seek comfort by hiding under the blanket.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a little girl is pulling the sheet down over her face while lying in bed. Her action of partially hiding herself could be interpreted as a playful act or a sign of shyness or fear. It is difficult to determine the exact context or narrative behind her behavior, but it could be a moment captured in a childhood scenario or a scene from a movie or story. The sentiment being portrayed appears to be a light-hearted one, with the little girl expressing either playfulness, curiosity, or a sense of unease in her current situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the child's emotion from facial expression and body language.\n2. Describe the narrative context implied by the child's behavior.",
