    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork in the image is a prime example of Cubism, a revolutionary art movement that emerged in the early 20th century. Cubism is characterized by several distinctive stylistic features:\n\n1. **Geometric Abstraction**: The subject is broken down into geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, and cones. In this painting, the face is fragmented and reassembled in an abstract form.\n\n2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Cubist artists depict objects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, creating a more dynamic and complex representation. Here, the face appears to be viewed from different angles at once.\n\n3. **Flatness and Lack of Depth**: The traditional rules of perspective are abandoned, and the painting often appears flat, with a lack of depth. This is evident in the way the different parts of the face are layered and overlap.\n\n4. **Interpenetration of Forms**: Forms are interpenetrated and overlap, creating a sense of movement and interaction. The different parts of the face in this painting seem to merge and intersect.\n\n5. **Use of Color**: While early Cubism often featured muted colors, later works, such as this one, incorporate a more vibrant color palette. The use of bright, contrasting colors adds to the dynamic and expressive quality of the painting.\n\nThe artist of this particular painting is Pablo Picasso, one of the founders of Cubism. His work often features these distinctive characteristics, making it easily identifiable as part of the Cubist movement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
