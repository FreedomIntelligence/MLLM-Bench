    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo improve the quality of the image, you can try adjusting the brightness and contrast to make the details more visible. Additionally, enhancing the sharpness and clarity of the image can help bring out more details in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
