    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and point out the difference between it and the general fan.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a portable space heater, often referred to as a small stove, sitting next to a black control panel. The heater has a circular fan next to it that can be used for direct heating of a small area. This is different from a general fan, as the heater is designed for providing warmth and comfort instead of just circulating air or cooling. The heater and the fan are both black and compact, making them suitable for personal use and travel. However, the heater is specifically designed for heating purposes and is not a general appliance like a regular fan.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a space heater, specifically a ceramic heater with a remote control. It is designed to produce and distribute heat to warm up a room or a specific area.\n\n**Differences between a space heater and a general fan:**\n\n1. **Functionality:**\n   - **Space Heater:** It generates heat to warm up the surrounding area.\n   - **General Fan:** It circulates air to cool down or ventilate the surrounding area.\n\n2. **Design:**\n   - **Space Heater:** Typically has a heating element, a fan, and a housing to contain and direct the heat.\n   - **General Fan:** Usually consists of a motor and blades to move air.\n\n3. **Energy Usage:**\n   - **Space Heater:** Consumes electricity or another energy source to produce heat.\n   - **General Fan:** Uses electricity to power the motor that drives the blades.\n\n4. **Temperature Control:**\n   - **Space Heater:** Often has temperature control settings to adjust the heat output.\n   - **General Fan:** Generally does not have temperature control, as it does not produce heat.\n\n5. **Safety Features:**\n   - **Space Heater:** May include safety features like overheat protection and tip-over switches.\n   - **General Fan:** Typically does not have such safety features, as it does not generate heat.\n\nIn summary, a space heater is designed to warm up an area by generating heat, while a general fan is designed to cool down or ventilate an area by circulating air.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a heater, not a fan.\n2. Note the heater's heat emission, contrasting with a fan's air circulation.",
