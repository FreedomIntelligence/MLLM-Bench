    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the human movement and environment in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a thrilling moment of a mountain biker in action. The scene is set outdoors in a rugged, rocky terrain, likely a mountainous or desert-like environment. The biker is captured mid-air, performing a jump over a rocky formation. The biker is leaning forward, indicating an active engagement in the sport. The bike is angled slightly downward, suggesting that the rider is in the process of landing after the jump.\n\nThe biker is dressed in typical mountain biking gear. He wears a black sleeveless top, orange shorts, and a full-face helmet with goggles, which is essential for protection in such extreme activities. The helmet and goggles are indicative of the high-speed and potentially dangerous nature of the sport. The biker also has gloves on, likely to provide better grip and protect the hands.\n\nThe rocky terrain is characterized by its rough and uneven surface, composed of variously sized rocks and boulders. The rocks are predominantly a mix of light and dark shades, suggesting different mineral compositions and exposure to the elements. The formation over which the biker is jumping is particularly prominent and jagged, adding to the sense of danger and excitement.\n\nIn the background, the landscape extends into a vast, open area with more rocky formations and possibly distant mountains. The sky is clear, indicating good weather conditions, which is essential for such outdoor activities. The lighting suggests that it is daytime, likely midday given the brightness and the shadows cast by the rocks and the biker.\n\nThe action captured in the image conveys a sense of adventure, skill, and adrenaline. Mountain biking, especially in such challenging terrains, requires a high level of physical fitness, balance, and expertise. The biker's posture and the position of the bike suggest that he is well-practiced and confident in his abilities.\n\nIn conclusion, this image vividly captures the essence of extreme mountain biking in a rugged, natural setting. The biker's gear, the rocky terrain, and the clear sky all contribute to the portrayal of an adventurous and thrilling moment in the sport. The scene emphasizes the challenge and excitement associated with mountain biking, highlighting the skill and courage required to navigate such extreme landscapes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is skillfully riding a bicycle down a rocky, dirt hillside. The cyclist is in motion, traveling on a narrow path between large rocks and boulders. The surrounding environment appears to be a mixture of mountainous terrain and a rocky cliff.
