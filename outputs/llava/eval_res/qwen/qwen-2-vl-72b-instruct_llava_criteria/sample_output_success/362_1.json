Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a winter ballad on the solitude and muffled world under snow, reflecting life's resilience in a monochrome setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the snow-covered scene, a man alone walks\nHis solitary steps echo in the crunchy ground\nSilent, muffled, the world around him hushes\nThe snow-muffled world, a monochrome landscape\n\nThe trees and buildings wear a white shroud\nBare branches stretch, reaching out frozen hands\nThe wind howls through the streets, whipped by the snow\nAs the man walks, his footprints swiftly fade away\n\nIn this frozen world, life's resilience lives on\nAmidst the white and grey, a colorless but persistent hue\nA man, though the snow may cover, continues on his way\nEmbracing the cold, the winter's melancholy song he'll sing\n\nIn the end, the snow will melt, and the world revealed\nThe man may find warmth, and perhaps, a heart to mend\nBut until then, in this solitude, he braves the cold\nA lone figure in a silent, snow-muffled world.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn a world of white, where snowflakes dance,\nA lone figure walks, in a silent trance.\nThe streets are empty, the air is still,\nA winter's spell, a frozen thrill.\n\nThe buildings stand, their windows aglow,\nIn the soft light, a monochrome show.\nNo sound but the crunch of snow beneath his feet,\nA world in hush, a winter's retreat.\n\nThe snowflakes fall, like silent tears,\nA blanket of white, without fear.\nThe world is muffled, the city asleep,\nA moment of peace, a winter's deep.\n\nThe figure moves, a solitary soul,\nIn the quiet night, he takes his role.\nA symbol of life, in a world so cold,\nA testament to resilience, a story to be told.\n\nThe snow may fall, the winds may blow,\nBut life persists, in its ebb and flow.\nIn the solitude of a winter's night,\nA single soul, a beacon of light.\n\nSo let the snow fall, let the world be still,\nFor in the silence, we find our will.\nTo brave the cold, to face the night,\nAnd in the morning, greet the light.\n\nFor in the solitude of a winter's day,\nWe find the strength to find our way.\nThrough the muffled world, the snow so white,\nWe find our path, and face the fight.\n\nSo here's to the winter, the snow so white,\nA time of peace, a moment of light.\nFor in the silence, we find our way,\nAnd in the solitude, we find our day.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Includes imagery of solitude, snow's muffled world, and monochrome setting.\n2. Reflects life's resilience in the context of a winter scene.\n3.
