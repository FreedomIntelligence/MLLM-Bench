    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe skater in the image appears to be performing an aerial trick, likely a kickflip or a similar maneuver. Based on his body position and the trajectory of the skateboard, it seems he is in the middle of the trick and will likely land back on the skateboard after completing the flip.\n\n### Next Move Prediction:\n1. **Completion of the Trick**: The skater will likely complete the kickflip, where the skateboard flips 360 degrees along its axis.\n2. **Landing**: After the flip, the skater will attempt to land back on the skateboard, positioning his feet to maintain balance and control.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n1. **Landing**: The most critical part of the trick is the landing. If the skater does not land perfectly, he may lose balance and fall, which could result in injuries.\n2. **Control**: Maintaining control of the skateboard during the flip is crucial. If the skateboard spins out of control, it could lead to an unsuccessful trick and a potential fall.\n3. **Environment**: The concrete surface of the skatepark can be unforgiving if the skater falls, increasing the risk of injury.\n\nOverall, while the skater is performing a skilled maneuver, there is a moderate risk associated with the action, primarily due to the potential for an imperfect landing or loss of control.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
