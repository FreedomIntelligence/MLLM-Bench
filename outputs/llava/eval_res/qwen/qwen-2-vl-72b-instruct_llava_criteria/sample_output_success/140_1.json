    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in this meme is primarily derived from irony and situational comedy. Here’s a breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. **Irony**: The woman expresses a dislike for dogs, but in the second panel, a dog is shown sitting in the passenger seat, driving the car. This creates a humorous contrast between her statement and the reality depicted in the image.\n\n2. **Situational Comedy**: The unexpected and absurd situation of a dog driving a car adds to the humor. It’s a playful and unrealistic scenario that is meant to be amusing.\n\n3. **Parody**: The meme parodies the \"This is the way\" meme format, which is a reference to the popular \"Baby Yoda\" meme from the TV show \"The Mandalorian.\" The use of this format adds an additional layer of humor for those familiar with the original meme.\n\nOverall, the meme employs irony, situational comedy, and parody to create its humorous effect.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
