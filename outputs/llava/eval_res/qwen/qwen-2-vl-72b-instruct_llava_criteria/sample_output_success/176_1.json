    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCan you determine the approximate diameter of the plate, assuming the diameter of an average orange is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm)?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSince the plate is described as being in the center of the box and is described as a \"small\" plate, it is likely that the diameter of the plate is smaller than the average size of an orange. However, without more information or a clear view of the plate, it is not possible to determine the exact diameter of the plate.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the approximate diameter of the plate, we can use the diameter of an average orange as a reference. Given that the diameter of an average orange is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm), we can estimate the plate's diameter by comparing its size to the oranges.\n\nIn the image, the plate is slightly larger than the diameter of the oranges. If we assume that the plate's diameter is about 1.5 times the diameter of an orange, we can calculate the approximate diameter of the plate as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Diameter of plate} = 1.5 \\times \\text{Diameter of an orange} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Diameter of plate} = 1.5 \\times 3 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Diameter of plate} = 4.5 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the approximate diameter of the plate is 4.5 inches (11.4 cm).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes plate diameter estimation using orange as reference.\n2. Estimation aligns with provided reference: approximately 6 inches.",
