    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic effect in this image is primarily due to the cow's exaggerated facial expression and pose. Here are the key elements that contribute to the humor:\n\n1. **Close-Up of the Nose**: The close-up of the cow's nose makes it appear disproportionately large, which is a common comedic technique in photography.\n2. **Tongue Out**: The cow has its tongue sticking out, which is an unusual and playful gesture for a cow, adding to the humor.\n3. **Eye Expression**: The cow's eye is visible and appears to be looking directly at the camera, giving it a curious and somewhat goofy expression.\n4. **Background Blur**: The blurred background focuses attention on the cow's face, emphasizing its exaggerated features and making the overall scene more humorous.\n5. **Overall Context**: The combination of these elements in a natural outdoor setting creates a lighthearted and amusing image that contrasts with the typically serious portrayal of cows.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
