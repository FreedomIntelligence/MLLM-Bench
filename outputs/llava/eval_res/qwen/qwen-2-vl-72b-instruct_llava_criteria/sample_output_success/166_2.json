    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headline discusses anti-Israel activists tearing down hostage posters in what the article describes as petty acts of hate. The broader context of this event is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, which has led to heightened tensions and acts of violence on both sides. The reference to \"hostage posters\" likely refers to posters displaying individuals who are being held hostage, possibly in the context of the conflict. The headline also mentions Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, vowing to continue violence against Jews, indicating a continuation of the conflict and the escalating rhetoric surrounding it.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3. Assess relevance and accuracy of external knowledge used in explanation.",
