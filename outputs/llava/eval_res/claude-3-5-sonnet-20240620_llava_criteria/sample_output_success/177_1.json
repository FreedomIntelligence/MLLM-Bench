    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nFor the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish in the bottom right photograph, can you determine the bounding box coordinates for the spoon? (The size of the image is 4096*4096)\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe bounding box coordinates for the spoon in the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish in the bottom right photograph are [0.69, 0.75, 0.85, 0.96] with a slight offset due to the angle.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFor the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish in the bottom right photograph, I can estimate the bounding box coordinates for the spoon. Given that the image size is 4096x4096 pixels, and the spoon is located in the lower right quadrant of the image, I would approximate the coordinates as follows:\n\nx1 (left): 2800\ny1 (top): 3400\nx2 (right): 3200\ny2 (bottom): 3900\n\nThese coordinates form a rectangle that should encompass the decorative spoon visible in the image. Please note that these are estimates based on visual inspection, and the actual precise coordinates may vary slightly.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify and provide bounding box coordinates around [(2048, 60), (3275, 1043)]",
