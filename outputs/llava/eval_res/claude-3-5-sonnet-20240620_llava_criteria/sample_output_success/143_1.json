    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image has several elements that contribute to its comedic effect:\n\n1. Extreme close-up: The cow's nose and mouth are extremely close to the camera, creating an exaggerated, almost cartoonish perspective.\n\n2. Distorted proportions: Due to the close-up, the cow's nose appears enormous compared to the rest of its body and the background, which is humorous.\n\n3. Unexpected angle: We're seeing the cow from an unusual vantage point, which surprises the viewer and adds to the comedic effect.\n\n4. Texture detail: The close-up allows us to see the texture of the cow's nose in great detail, including its moistness and the fine hairs, which is both fascinating and slightly absurd.\n\n5. Contrast with background: The super-close nose contrasts sharply with the pastoral scene behind it, creating a funny juxtaposition.\n\n6. Curious expression: The cow appears to be investigating the camera, giving it an inquisitive look that anthropomorphizes it slightly.\n\n7. Visible nostrils: The large, dark nostrils are prominently featured, adding to the overall comical appearance.\n\n8. Pink tongue: A glimpse of the cow's pink tongue adds a touch of silliness to the image.\n\n9. Out-of-focus companion: There's another cow in the background, out of focus, which adds to the sense that this cow is \"breaking the fourth wall\" by approaching the camera.\n\nAll these elements combine to create a humorous, unexpected, and slightly absurd image that subverts our usual expectations of how we view cows, resulting in a comedic effect.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
