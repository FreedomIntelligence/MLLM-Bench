    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotional exchange occurring between the individuals by considering their hand gestures, facial expressions, and the proximity to one another.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the man and the woman are facing each other, engaged in a heated exchange. The woman is pointing her finger at the man, which often signifies a direct, assertive, or even confrontational tone in their conversation. Meanwhile, the man is smiling, which may indicate that he is either enjoying the interaction, trying to diffuse the situation, or simply being playful. The close proximity of the individuals further emphasizes the intensity of their emotional exchange. Overall, the scene suggests a lively and potentially tension-filled conversation between the two people.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a highly charged emotional exchange between two individuals. Their body language and facial expressions suggest they are engaged in an intense argument or disagreement.\n\nBoth people are standing close to each other, indicating the conversation is personal and heated. They are both using assertive hand gestures, pointing fingers at each other, which is often associated with accusation or emphasizing a point forcefully.\n\nTheir facial expressions are particularly telling. Both individuals have their mouths open, suggesting they are speaking loudly or possibly yelling. Their brows are furrowed, and their overall expressions convey anger or frustration.\n\nThe man on the left appears to be smiling, but it seems more like a grimace or a sarcastic expression rather than genuine happiness. The woman on the right has a more overtly angry expression, with her mouth open wide as if mid-shout.\n\nTheir body postures are confrontational, facing each other directly with no signs of backing down. This, combined with their proximity and animated gestures, suggests a high level of tension and conflict in their interaction.\n\nOverall, the emotional exchange appears to be one of anger, frustration, and confrontation. The body language and facial expressions of both individuals indicate they are in the midst of a heated argument or dispute, with both parties actively engaged in making their points forcefully.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by both individuals' facial expressions and hand gestures as angry.\n2. Describe the nature of the emotional exchange based on proximity and body language.",
