    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the dancer's landing technique, and suggest the next movements that would follow.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the dancer's position in the image, I predict the landing technique will be a soft plié (bent knee) landing on the front foot (right foot in the image). The dancer appears to be in a suspended jump or leap with arms outstretched and one foot pointed downward, suggesting a controlled descent.\n\nFor the next movements that would likely follow:\n\n1. Upon landing in plié, the dancer might smoothly transition into a relevé (rise onto the toes) on the landing foot.\n\n2. This could be followed by a graceful rond de jambe (circular movement of the leg) with the free leg (left leg in the image).\n\n3. The arms would likely flow from their outstretched position into a more curved, expressive pose, perhaps coming together in front of the body or moving through a port de bras (arm movement).\n\n4. Given the dynamic nature of the pose captured, the dancer might then execute a quick turn or pirouette, using the momentum from the landing.\n\n5. Alternatively, they could move into a series of fluid contemporary movements, such as an undulating motion through the torso, or a fall and recovery sequence.\n\n6. The flowing blue jumpsuit suggests this might be a contemporary or modern dance piece, so the following movements are likely to be expressive and may incorporate floorwork or more grounded movements that contrast with the airborne position shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the woman in the blue dress appears to be in the middle of a ballet move, with her arms and legs extended. As she appears to be dancing on the pavement in front of a building, she might be performing an outdoor dance or show. Since she seems to be in mid-air, it is likely that she will be performing a controlled landing, which involves bending her knees slightly to absorb the impact of her feet touching the pavement. Once she lands, she might continue her dance, possibly following a specific choreography or improvising her movements. The next movements could include graceful footwork, turns, or even more aerial maneuvers, depending on the style and complexity of the dance being performed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately predict the dancer's landing technique based on body posture and movement direction.\n2. Suggest plausible next dance movements that could logically follow from the landing position.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects a coherent understanding of dance motion and sequence.",
