    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBy integrating the expressions, actions, and attire of the characters in the image, could you please speculate on the likely age group to which they belong?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the individuals appear to be young adults, likely in their early to mid-20s. This assessment is based on several factors:\n\n1. Graduation attire: They are wearing traditional black graduation gowns and mortarboard caps, indicating they are completing a level of higher education.\n\n2. Facial features and expressions: While I can't identify specific individuals, the visible faces appear youthful and energetic, typical of young adults.\n\n3. Celebratory behavior: Their exuberant poses, raised arms, and joyful expressions suggest the excitement of a major life milestone, common for those finishing college or university.\n\n4. Setting: The background appears to be a gymnasium or similar large indoor space, which is a typical venue for graduation ceremonies at many educational institutions.\n\n5. Group dynamics: The diversity and camaraderie of the group is representative of a cohort that has likely spent several years studying together.\n\nGiven these observations, it's reasonable to conclude that these individuals are most likely recent graduates of a college or university program, typically putting them in the age range of 21-25 years old. However, it's important to note that students can graduate at various ages, so there could be some variation in the actual ages of the individuals in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe group of people in the image are young, and they appear to be of high school age. They are dressed in caps and gowns, which are commonly attire for high school commencement ceremonies. Their actions, such as smiling, dancing, and celebrating, suggest that they are joyful about their accomplishments, further supporting the idea that they are young high school graduates.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if the answer determines an age group based on graduation attire and joyful expressions.\n2. Check for reasoning that associates attire with a typical graduation age group.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects understanding of actions indicating a celebration, likely a graduation event.",
