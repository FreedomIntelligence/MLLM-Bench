    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow many columns can be seen on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial in this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere are 36 Doric style columns visible on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn this image of the Lincoln Memorial, you can see 8 columns on the visible facade. The memorial is shown from an angle, so only the front and one side are visible. The columns are the large, white, vertical structures that support the roof of the building, typical of Greek revival architecture. The image captures the memorial in beautiful lighting, likely during the \"blue hour\" just after sunset or before sunrise, giving it a majestic appearance against the clear blue sky.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly count the visible columns on the facade: 12.",
