    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that captures the duality of the character's persona as portrayed by the face paint overlaying the natural expression, reflecting the contrast between the facade and the individual's true self.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n\"Beneath the Painted Smile: A Portrait of Duality\"\n\nThis caption captures the essence of the image, which shows a striking contrast between a somber, natural face and an overlaid, colorful clown makeup. The phrase \"Beneath the Painted Smile\" alludes to the vibrant, exaggerated makeup associated with clowns, while also hinting at the more serious, perhaps melancholic expression visible underneath. \"A Portrait of Duality\" directly addresses the theme of contrasting personas - the outward, performative character represented by the face paint, and the inner, true self reflected in the natural facial features and expression. This duality is visually represented in the image through the clever superimposition of the two conflicting appearances.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe face of the Joker, with his red, white, and blue makeup, is overlaid with a face that reflects his true self, creating a compelling contrast between the persona and the individual's genuine thoughts and emotions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption identifies the contrast between face paint and natural expression.\n2. Caption reflects the concept of duality in the character's persona.\n3. Caption is coherent and contextually relevant to the image.",
