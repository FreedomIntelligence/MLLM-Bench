    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image,  describe the settings and identify the type of activity taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a person sitting at a desk with two desktop computer screens and a keyboard in front of them. The individual is engaged in a video game activity, using the computer screens to play an online video game. It appears to be a gaming setup, possibly for a multiplayer or first-person shooter game, given the presence of two screens and a keyboard for controlling the game. The person is focused on the screens, likely interacting with the game to progress through levels or complete objectives.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a gaming setup in what appears to be a dimly lit room. The main focus is on a computer monitor displaying a colorful video game scene, likely from a first-person shooter or action game. The screen shows a vibrant purple environment with some kind of structure or arena.\n\nIn front of the monitor is a gaming keyboard with RGB lighting, creating a colorful glow. There's also a gaming headset visible, with red illumination on the ear cups. A second monitor can be seen to the right, showing a different game or application.\n\nThe activity taking place is clearly video gaming. The person in the image is seated at the computer, hands on the keyboard, actively engaged in playing the game on screen. This setup, with its specialized gaming peripherals and multiple monitors, suggests a dedicated gaming environment, possibly for competitive or streaming purposes.\n\nThe low-light setting and the glow from the screens and peripherals create an immersive atmosphere typical of serious gaming setups or perhaps a gaming cafe or esports facility.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify indoor setting with computer gaming equipment.\n2. Recognize the activity as playing a video game.",
