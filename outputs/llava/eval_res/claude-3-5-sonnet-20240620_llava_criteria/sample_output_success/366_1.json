    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe Leap of Faith\n\nThe fog rolled in thick and heavy, blanketing the road ahead in a veil of mystery. It was as if the world beyond ceased to exist, swallowed by an impenetrable white void. Yet there it stood - a solitary figure poised on the edge of the known, ready to take a leap into the unknown.\n\nClad in black, a stark contrast against the misty backdrop, the figure seemed to hesitate for just a moment. The yellow line stretched out before them, a beacon cutting through the haze, promising direction but not destination. It was an invitation to journey, to explore, to dare.\n\nWith a deep breath, muscles tensed, and in one fluid motion, the figure sprang forward. For a heartbeat, they were suspended in mid-air, neither here nor there, caught between what was and what could be. It was more than just a physical jump; it was a metaphorical leap of faith.\n\nAs they soared over the dividing line, time seemed to slow. In that moment of flight, all the fears, doubts, and hesitations of the past were left behind. Ahead lay possibility, potential, and the exhilarating uncertainty of a new beginning.\n\nThe road disappeared into the mist, its end obscured and unknown. But that was the beauty of it all. Every step forward would be a discovery, every mile a new chapter in an unwritten story. The fog wasn't an obstacle; it was a canvas waiting to be painted with adventures yet to come.\n\nAs gravity began to reclaim its hold, pulling the figure back towards the earth, a sense of liberation washed over them. They had made the choice to move forward, to embrace the journey ahead, regardless of where it might lead.\n\nWith feet touching down on the other side of the line, the figure didn't break stride. They continued onward, each step full of purpose and determination. The mist might shroud the path ahead, but it couldn't dampen the spirit of one who had chosen to leap into their future.\n\nAnd so, with the open road before them and endless possibilities ahead, they ventured forth into the fog, ready to write their own story on the blank pages of the unknown.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3. Incorporates the visual of the person jumping as part of the narrative.",
