    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I intend to pack a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand, which container from the picture should I select?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image and considering the size of a grown man's hand, I would recommend using the largest cup available. It is located towards the right side of the image and seems to be a good fit for the sandwich. However, it is important to keep in mind that cups are typically designed for beverages and not for housing food items like a sandwich. Therefore, you might need to use a more suitable container or wrap the sandwich securely before placing it in the cup.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, for a sandwich roughly the size of a grown man's hand, the most suitable container would likely be one of the round, flat containers with lids visible in the picture. These appear to be takeout-style food containers that would be appropriate for storing a sandwich.\n\nThere are several circular containers with lids shown in the image, arranged in different sizes. The larger ones among these would be ideal for a hand-sized sandwich. They seem to have enough depth to accommodate the thickness of a sandwich and enough diameter to fit its length and width comfortably.\n\nThe image doesn't show any containers that are specifically designed for sandwiches (like triangular sandwich boxes), so these round containers are the best option from what's available in the picture. They would keep the sandwich secure and prevent it from getting squashed during transport.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify container size suitable for a grown man's hand-sized sandwich.\n2. Justify container choice based on dimensions and shape.",
