    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the white objects in the image and determine their functionality.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe white objects in the image are small figurines that appear to be stylized representations of chickens or birds. They have round white bodies, orange scarves or collars, and small crowns or crests on their heads. Their faces have simple features painted on, including eyes and beaks.\n\nAs for their functionality, these appear to be decorative or collectible items rather than having a specific practical function. They could serve several purposes:\n\n1. Toys: They might be used as playable figurines for children.\n2. Game pieces: They could be part of a board game or tabletop game.\n3. Decorative items: They might be used as cute ornaments or display pieces.\n4. Cake toppers: Their small size and uniform appearance suggest they could be used to decorate cakes or other desserts.\n\nThere's also a single black figurine among the white ones, which might indicate that these are part of a set or collection where the black one plays a special role, perhaps in a game or storytelling context.\n\nIn the background, there's a white serving tray visible, which is likely used for carrying drinks or food items, but it's not the main focus of the question about white objects in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white snowmen, or snowflakes, and other white objects, such as cups and vases, arranged on a wooden dining table. These objects are designed as decorative items for the table, adding an element of festivity and charm to the setting. The snowflakes and snowmen may be part of a theme or an aesthetic choice, while the cups and vases serve as functional items for holding beverages or displaying flowers, respectively. Overall, the main focus of the image is the creative and decorative arrangement of these white objects on the tabletop.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all white objects as 'tumbler toys' accurately.\n2. Describe the functionality of tumbler toys correctly.\n3. Exclude non-white objects and irrelevant background items.",
