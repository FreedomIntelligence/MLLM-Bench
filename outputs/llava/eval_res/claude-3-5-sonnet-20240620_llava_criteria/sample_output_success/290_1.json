    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image depicts a bike that has been a part of my collection for quite some time. If I were to consider riding it, could you please advise me on the components required to restore it to working condition?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo restore the bike to working condition, you'll need to assess the bike's current condition, identify any damaged or missing parts, and acquire the necessary components. You can start by examining the following parts:\n\n1. Frame: Check for any visible signs of rust or corrosion, and make sure the frame is structurally sound.\n2. Wheels: Examine the wheels for any signs of wear, rust, or missing components. Spokes, hubs, and trims might be in need of replacement or repair.\n3. Chain: Assess the bike's chain for length, wear, and lubrication. A well-maintained chain is crucial for smooth operation and gear shifting.\n4. Gears and Derailleurs: Check the bike's gears for wear or signs of rust, and ensure that the derailleurs are functional.\n5. Brakes: Examine the bike's brakes for proper function and wear. Pads might need to be replaced or adjusted.\n6. Seat and Handlebars: Check for any damages, wear, or rust on the seat and handlebars.\n7. Tires: Assess the tires for proper inflation, wear, and overall condition.\n8. Lights and Reflectors: Verify if the bike is equipped with functioning lights and reflectors.\n\nOnce you've identified the required components, you can start sourcing the necessary parts by visiting local bike shops, online stores, or auction websites. Additionally, you might need to repair or replace some parts that are no longer available or need custom-made replicas.\n\nTaking the bike to a professional repair shop or a mechanic with experience in restoring old bikes would be beneficial as they can provide accurate assessments and guide you through the process of restoring the bike to a functional and safe state.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, this appears to be an old Diamondback BMX bike frame that's missing several key components. To restore it to working condition, you would need:\n\n1. A front wheel and tire\n2. A seat and seat post\n3. Handlebars and grips\n4. A chain\n5. Pedals (only one is visible in the image)\n6. Possibly new bearings for the wheels, bottom bracket, and headset\n7. New brake system (cables, levers, and calipers)\n\nThe frame, rear wheel, and crankset appear to be present, but they may need cleaning, lubrication, and possibly replacement depending on their condition. The fork also seems to be intact.\n\nGiven the age and condition of the bike, you might also want to consider:\n\n1. Rust treatment and repainting the frame\n2. Replacing the existing rear tire\n3. Overhauling or replacing the rear hub\n4. Checking and possibly replacing the bottom bracket\n\nBefore investing in restoration, it would be wise to thoroughly inspect the frame for any cracks or structural damage that might make it unsafe to ride. If the frame is sound, this could be an interesting restoration project, potentially resulting in a vintage BMX bike.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify missing/damaged components: front tire, chain, pedal, handle bar, seat.\n2. Explain the function of each identified component for bike restoration.",
