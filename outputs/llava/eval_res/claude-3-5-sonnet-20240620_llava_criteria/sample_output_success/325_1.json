    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo improve the quality of this nighttime image, you could consider the following techniques:\n\n1. Use a tripod: This would allow for longer exposure times without introducing camera shake, resulting in a sharper image with less noise.\n\n2. Lower the ISO: A lower ISO setting would reduce the grainy appearance in the darker areas of the image.\n\n3. Adjust the aperture: A wider aperture (lower f-number) would allow more light in, potentially allowing for a lower ISO or faster shutter speed.\n\n4. Longer exposure time: This would capture more light and detail, especially in the darker areas of the image.\n\n5. Use manual focus: Ensure the focus is sharp, especially on the main subjects like the lit-up house and tree.\n\n6. Bracket exposures: Take multiple shots at different exposures and combine them in post-processing for better dynamic range.\n\n7. Post-processing: Adjust contrast, shadows, and highlights in editing software to bring out more detail in both dark and bright areas.\n\n8. Use a wider lens: This could capture more of the scene and potentially allow for more interesting compositions.\n\n9. Consider adding some foreground interest: This could add depth to the image.\n\n10. Experiment with white balance: Adjusting the white balance could enhance the warm glow of the decorative lights.\n\nThese techniques could help to create a clearer, more detailed, and more visually appealing nighttime street scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
