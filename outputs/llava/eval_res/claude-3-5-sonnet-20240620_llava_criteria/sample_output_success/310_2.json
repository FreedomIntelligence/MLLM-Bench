Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSolve the problem 11 in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo prove that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR, we'll use the properties of equilateral triangles and the given information. Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1) Given: Triangles PQR and PUS are both equilateral.\n\n2) In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal and all angles are 60°.\n\n3) Therefore, in triangle PQR:\n   PQ = QR = PR\n   Angle PQR = Angle QRP = Angle RPQ = 60°\n\n4) Similarly, in triangle PUS:\n   PU = US = PS\n   Angle PUS = Angle USP = Angle SPU = 60°\n\n5) Now, let's look at triangle PUQ:\n   - PU is a side of the equilateral triangle PUS\n   - PQ is a side of the equilateral triangle PQR\n   - Angle UPQ = 60° (it's an angle of the equilateral triangle PUS)\n\n6) Similarly, for triangle PSR:\n   - PS is a side of the equilateral triangle PUS\n   - PR is a side of the equilateral triangle PQR\n   - Angle SPR = 60° (it's an angle of the equilateral triangle PUS)\n\n7) We can now use the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence criterion:\n   - PU = PS (sides of the same equilateral triangle PUS)\n   - PQ = PR (sides of the same equilateral triangle PQR)\n   - Angle UPQ = Angle SPR = 60°\n\n8) Since we have two sides and the included angle equal in both triangles, by the SAS criterion, triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that triangle PUQ is congruent to triangle PSR.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the problem states that the area of the triangular ABC is 1950 square centimeters. The triangle has a base that is 7 times as long as the altitude and is 3 times as wide. The height of the triangle is 24 centimeters. We can use this information to solve the problem, but it would involve solving multiple equations, which goes beyond the scope of a simple text description. Instead, I recommend using a graphing calculator or software to find the solution, as they can visualize the triangle and solve the equations more effectively.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of triangles PQR, PUS, PUQ, and PSR in the image.\n2. Application of congruence criteria to prove PUQ ≅ PSR.\n3. Explanation includes reasoning based on properties of equilateral triangles.",
