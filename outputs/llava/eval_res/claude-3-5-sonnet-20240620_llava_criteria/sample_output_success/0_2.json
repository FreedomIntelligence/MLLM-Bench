    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the primary structure in the image and describe its architectural style and features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe primary structure in this image is the Manhattan Bridge, which is visible in the background framed by the buildings on either side of the street. \n\nThe Manhattan Bridge is an iconic example of a suspension bridge, a style of bridge architecture that was revolutionary when it was built in the early 20th century. Key features of its architectural style visible in the image include:\n\n1. The distinctive steel towers that rise above the roadway, forming the bridge's main support structure.\n\n2. The large cables that sweep down from the towers, creating the bridge's characteristic silhouette.\n\n3. The vertical suspender cables that connect the main cables to the bridge deck.\n\n4. The intricate lattice-work of steel that forms the bridge's structural support, visible beneath the roadway.\n\nThe bridge's design combines both form and function, with its grand scale and elegant lines making it not just a practical river crossing but also a monumental piece of urban architecture. Its presence in this street scene creates a striking contrast between the historic, early 20th-century engineering of the bridge and the more modern urban landscape of buildings, cars, and city life in the foreground.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary structure in the image is the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge in New York City, built in 1883. It spans over the East River, connecting the borough of Brooklyn with Manhattan. The bridge has a distinctive twin-tower design, with two towers at the abutments on each end of the bridge. These towers house the cable supports and carry the weight of the suspended bridge deck, which is suspended from them. The bridge's architectural style is a blend of Gothic and Romanesque influences, making it an important historical and cultural landmark.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the primary structure as a bridge.\n2. Describe the architectural style of the bridge (e.g., suspension, cable-stayed).\n3. Mention specific features of the bridge (e.g., towers, cables).",
