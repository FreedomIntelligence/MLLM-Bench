    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the container in the top left corner in the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, will people likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle containing boiling water at 100°C without using proper protective measures like oven mitts or a thick towel. The hot water can cause burns to their hands, especially if the bottle is made of a heat-conductive material, such as plastic. It is important to handle hot containers with care and use appropriate protective equipment to avoid accidents and injuries.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nNo, people are not likely to be scalded if they hold the container in the top left corner, even if it was filled with boiling water at 100°C. \n\nThe container you're referring to appears to be a vacuum-insulated tumbler or travel mug, likely made by Starbucks as part of their \"Romantic Blossoms Collection.\" These types of containers are specifically designed to keep hot beverages hot while maintaining a comfortable external temperature.\n\nThe double-wall vacuum insulation in these containers creates an effective barrier that prevents the heat from the liquid inside from transferring quickly to the outer surface. This means that even if the contents are very hot, the exterior of the container remains cool enough to hold comfortably.\n\nHowever, it's always wise to exercise caution with hot beverages. While the container itself may not cause scalding, the liquid inside is still very hot and could cause injury if spilled.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference the insulated nature of the bottle and the unlikelihood of scalding.\n2. Include reasoning on the physical properties of insulation.",
