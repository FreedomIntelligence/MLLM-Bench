    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the childâ€™s behavior to infer the narrative and sentiment being portrayed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image portrays a child exhibiting behavior that suggests fear or anxiety. The child is shown in bed, pulling the covers up high to partially obscure their face, with only their eyes visible above the blanket. Their eyes are wide open and appear to be looking to the side, giving an impression of alertness or wariness.\n\nThis behavior is often associated with children feeling scared, perhaps of imagined monsters or noises in the dark. The narrative that can be inferred is that of a child experiencing nighttime fears or anxiety, possibly struggling to fall asleep due to these feelings.\n\nThe sentiment being portrayed is one of vulnerability and unease. The child's attempt to hide behind the blanket suggests a desire for protection or security. The wide-eyed expression conveys a sense of alertness to potential threats, real or imagined.\n\nOverall, the image captures a common childhood experience of feeling scared at night, evoking empathy and perhaps nostalgia in viewers who may remember similar experiences from their own childhoods. It effectively communicates the universal theme of confronting fears and seeking comfort in a vulnerable moment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a little girl is pulling the sheet down over her face while lying in bed. Her action of partially hiding herself could be interpreted as a playful act or a sign of shyness or fear. It is difficult to determine the exact context or narrative behind her behavior, but it could be a moment captured in a childhood scenario or a scene from a movie or story. The sentiment being portrayed appears to be a light-hearted one, with the little girl expressing either playfulness, curiosity, or a sense of unease in her current situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the child's emotion from facial expression and body language.\n2. Describe the narrative context implied by the child's behavior.",
