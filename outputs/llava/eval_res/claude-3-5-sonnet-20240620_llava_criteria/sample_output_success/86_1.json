    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the scenery in the image in detail, where is this image been shot, what time does this image is been shot, and other information that could be helpful for others to recognize this image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a picturesque night scene dominated by a tall building in the midst of a forest. The building is situated atop a hill, and the sky above it is filled with a starry night display. The scene looks like it's located in a mountainous area, with trees surrounding the building and the star-filled sky serving as a backdrop. The nighttime setting is enhanced by the presence of several bright stars that create a mesmerizing atmosphere.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image captures a breathtaking night scene in what appears to be a mountainous region of East Asia, likely in Korea or China. The focal point of the image is a traditional pagoda-style building, possibly a temple or observatory, perched on a hillside. Its red color and multi-tiered roof are distinctive against the dark landscape.\n\nThe sky is the most striking element of the image. It shows a long-exposure shot of star trails, creating concentric circles in the night sky. This indicates that the image was taken over a period of several hours during the night, with the camera pointed towards the celestial north (or south, depending on the hemisphere).\n\nThe landscape is densely forested, with mountains visible in the background. There's a hint of dawn or dusk on the horizon, suggesting this might be capturing the transition from night to day or vice versa.\n\nThe foreground shows some tree branches, adding depth to the composition. The overall color palette is dominated by deep blues in the sky, transitioning to warmer oranges and yellows near the horizon.\n\nThis image was likely shot from a vantage point on a nearby hill or mountain, given the elevated perspective of the pagoda and the surrounding landscape. The photographer has skillfully balanced the exposure to capture both the dim starlight and the illuminated building.\n\nThis type of image requires careful planning and execution, considering factors like moon phase, weather conditions, and the rotation of the Earth to capture the star trails. It's a stunning example of landscape astrophotography, blending cultural architecture with natural celestial phenomena.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the scenery elements: star trails, pagoda, trees, and mountains.\n2. Determine and state the likely time of day: night, with reference to star trails.\n3. Provide contextual clues for location recognition without specifying the exact place.",
