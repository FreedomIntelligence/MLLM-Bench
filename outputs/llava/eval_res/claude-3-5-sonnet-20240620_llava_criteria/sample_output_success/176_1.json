    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCan you determine the approximate diameter of the plate, assuming the diameter of an average orange is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm)?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSince the plate is described as being in the center of the box and is described as a \"small\" plate, it is likely that the diameter of the plate is smaller than the average size of an orange. However, without more information or a clear view of the plate, it is not possible to determine the exact diameter of the plate.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo estimate the diameter of the plate, I'll compare it to the oranges in the image, using the given average orange diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm).\n\nLooking at the image, the plate with colorful candies appears to be about 2 to 2.5 times the diameter of a single orange. \n\nIf we use 2.25 as our multiplier:\n\n2.25 x 3 inches = 6.75 inches\n\nOr in centimeters:\n2.25 x 7.6 cm = 17.1 cm\n\nTherefore, based on the visual comparison and the given average orange size, I would estimate the approximate diameter of the plate to be around 6.75 inches (17.1 cm).\n\nThis puts it in the range of a typical dessert or salad plate, which seems appropriate for the small assortment of candies it contains.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes plate diameter estimation using orange as reference.\n2. Estimation aligns with provided reference: approximately 6 inches.",
