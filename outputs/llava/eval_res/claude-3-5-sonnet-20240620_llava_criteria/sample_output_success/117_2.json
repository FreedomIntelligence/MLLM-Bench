    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpre the man's facial expression, what might lead to this?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a person with an extremely agitated and angry facial expression. Their eyes are tightly shut, mouth wide open as if yelling or shouting, and their overall posture suggests intense frustration or rage. They are holding a telephone receiver close to their face, which implies they are in the middle of a heated phone conversation.\n\nThis type of reaction could be caused by several factors:\n\n1. Receiving extremely upsetting news over the phone\n2. Dealing with poor customer service or a frustrating automated phone system\n3. Having an argument with someone on the other end of the line\n4. Being put on hold for an extended period\n5. Receiving unexpected or exorbitant charges\n6. Being denied a service or request they feel entitled to\n\nThe person's formal attire (wearing a blazer) suggests this could be a work-related call, which might add to the stress and frustration if it involves a business matter or professional relationship.\n\nThe presence of eyeglasses on the table might indicate that this person has been dealing with this issue for some time, possibly removing them due to stress or to rub their eyes in exasperation.\n\nOverall, the facial expression and body language convey a moment of peak frustration or anger during what appears to be a very difficult phone conversation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe man's facial expression in the image seems to display a mix of surprise, frustration, and indignance. He is holding a rotary dial telephone over his shoulder and appears to be shouting into it. His displeasure might be caused by various factors, such as receiving unexpected or unwanted news or encountering an issue with the telephone itself, like difficulty understanding or hearing the other person, or even being faced with a situation that triggered his angry reaction. It is essential to note that the exact cause of his reaction cannot be definitively determined from the image alone, but it is clear that he is not pleased with the situation he is experiencing.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the specific facial expression (e.g., anger, frustration) and its intensity.",
