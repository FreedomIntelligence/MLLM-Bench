    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of symbol is this? Identify all elements in the symbol and describe their meanings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis symbol is a recycling symbol, specifically for plastic type 2, which is High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE).\n\nThe symbol consists of two main elements:\n\n1. Triangle: The symbol features a triangle made up of three curved arrows chasing each other in a clockwise direction. This is the universal symbol for recycling, representing the idea of a continuous cycle and the process of converting waste materials into reusable products.\n\n2. Number: Inside the triangle, there's a number \"2\". In the context of recycling symbols, this number indicates the type of plastic material.\n\nBelow the triangle, we can see the letters \"HDPE\", which stand for High-Density Polyethylene. This is the full name of the plastic type represented by the number 2.\n\nThe entire symbol is embossed or molded into what appears to be a plastic surface, likely on a product or packaging made from HDPE plastic.\n\nThis symbol serves to inform consumers and recycling facilities about the type of plastic used, which is crucial for proper sorting and recycling processes. HDPE is commonly used for items such as milk jugs, shampoo bottles, and some types of plastic bags.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe symbol is a recycle logo, also known as the recycling arrows symbol. The symbol is usually represented by three chasing arrows forming a triangle, with the words \"HDPE\" present below the arrows. The three chasing arrows signify the process of recycling, with each arrow representing a different stage: breaking down the used material, melting it down, and remolding it into new products. The \"HDPE\" stands for high-density polyethylene, which is a type of plastic commonly used for bottles and containers. This symbol is used to indicate the recyclability of HDPE materials and encourages people to recycle items made of this type of plastic.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify symbol as resin identification code for HDPE, which is the abbreviation of High-Density Polyethylene.\n2. Explain the meaning of the triangular shape and the number 2 inside it.",
