    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify potential humorous elements within the image, and create a humorous caption for the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nPotential humorous elements in this image include:\n\n1. An adult riding a small scooter, which is often associated with children's toys.\n2. The intense, focused expression on the rider's face, contrasting with the seemingly casual mode of transport.\n3. The blurred background suggesting high speed, despite being on a tiny scooter.\n4. The juxtaposition of the rider's mature appearance with the youthful activity.\n\nHumorous caption:\n\n\"When you're late for work but gas prices are through the roof.\"\n\nThis caption plays on the idea of an adult using an unconventional and somewhat silly mode of transportation (a small scooter) as a serious solution to a common adult problem (high gas prices and being late for work). It highlights the contrast between the rider's apparent urgency and the childlike nature of the scooter, creating a humorous scenario.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humorous element in the image is the man with a backpack on his back seemingly having trouble balancing on the small scooter. Riding a scooter could be challenging, especially if the man is not used to it. The fact that the man is wearing a backpack might also add a playful element to the scene, as he rides quickly down the street, possibly struggling to maintain his balance.\n\nA humorous caption for this image could be: \"The man with the backpack races to catch the bus, but the scooter might not be fast enough to keep up with his schedule.\"\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes a humorous take on the adult riding a child's scooter.\n2. Humor relates to the contrast between the rider's intense expression and the playful activity.\n3. Caption is creative, contextually relevant to the image, and evokes amusement.",
