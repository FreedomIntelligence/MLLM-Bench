    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the iPhone appears to have significant damage to its rear glass panel. The damage is concentrated in the upper right corner of the device, where there are visible cracks and shattered glass. The cracks seem to extend from the corner towards the center of the phone.\n\nExtent of damage:\n- Severe cracking and shattering of the rear glass panel\n- Damage is localized to the upper right corner but extends partially across the back\n- The metal frame around the edges appears intact\n- The camera module seems unaffected\n\nUsability without repair:\nWhile the phone might still function, using it without repair is not recommended for several reasons:\n\n1. Safety: The shattered glass could lead to cuts or injuries when handling the phone.\n2. Further damage: The broken glass exposes the phone's internal components to dust, moisture, and potential further damage.\n3. Structural integrity: The damage may compromise the phone's water and dust resistance.\n4. Functionality: While not visible in this image, the damage could potentially affect internal components or the phone's overall performance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the phone might power on and perform basic functions, it would be unsafe and inadvisable to use it in this condition without repair. The extent of the damage suggests that a replacement of the rear glass panel would be necessary to restore the phone to a safe and fully functional state.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
