    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nObserving the vehicle, what event could have resulted in such a scenario?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it appears that an avalanche has occurred or is in progress. The vehicle, which looks like a yellow Jeep, is surrounded by a massive cloud of snow cascading down a mountainside. The avalanche seems to have been triggered, possibly by natural causes or human activity, and the Jeep is caught in its path.\n\nThis scenario could have resulted from several potential events:\n\n1. Natural avalanche: Unstable snow conditions on the mountainside could have led to a spontaneous avalanche.\n\n2. Triggered avalanche: The vehicle's movement or weight could have set off the avalanche as it was driving through the area.\n\n3. Controlled avalanche: Sometimes, ski resorts or mountain management teams intentionally trigger avalanches to reduce risk. This could be a controlled event that the Jeep inadvertently got caught in.\n\n4. Nearby explosion or vibration: Mining or construction activities in the area could have triggered the avalanche.\n\n5. Extreme weather event: A sudden change in temperature or heavy snowfall could have destabilized the snowpack, leading to this avalanche.\n\nThe image dramatically illustrates the power and danger of avalanches, especially to vehicles and people in mountainous, snow-covered areas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the vehicle is driving in mid-air, surrounded by a massive amount of snow blown up into the air, and trees are also visible in the background. This could be the result of the vehicle driving through a snowstorm or a sudden snow blizzard, where the high winds and heavy snowfall have caused snow to be blown up in the air around the vehicle. The large amount of snow and the potential risk of visibility issues could be dangerous for the driver, making such a situation potentially hazardous if not handled with caution.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention \"avalanche\" as the event causing the scenario.\n2. Describe the vehicle's interaction with the snow indicating an avalanche (e.g. the vehicle is partially underneath the snow)",
