    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCalculate the value of I in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows an integral:\n\nI = ∫ (4sin²(lnx) / x) dx\n\nTo calculate this integral, we need to use a few integration techniques:\n\n1) First, recognize that this is in the form of ∫ (f(lnx) / x) dx, which can be solved by substituting u = lnx.\n\n2) Let u = lnx\n   Then du = (1/x) dx\n   And x = e^u\n\n3) Substituting these into the integral:\n\n   I = ∫ 4sin²u du\n\n4) We can use the trigonometric identity: sin²u = (1 - cos(2u)) / 2\n\n   I = ∫ 4 * (1 - cos(2u)) / 2 du\n   I = ∫ (2 - 2cos(2u)) du\n\n5) Integrating:\n\n   I = 2u - sin(2u) + C\n\n6) Substituting back u = lnx:\n\n   I = 2lnx - sin(2lnx) + C\n\nThis is the final answer. The value of I is 2lnx - sin(2lnx) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the equation provided in the image, I is equal to 4. Sin(2I).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer correctly calculates I as -25/56 from the integral in the image.\n2. Solution demonstrates understanding of integral calculus and trigonometric identities.\n3. Response includes a step-by-step explanation of the integral calculation process.",
