    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the elements in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image shows a vibrant and colorful floral pattern on a dark green background. The pattern is composed of various stylized flowers and leaves in a repeating design.\n\nThe flowers come in several shapes and colors:\n- Large, multi-petaled blooms in red and orange tones with light blue centers\n- Smaller star-shaped flowers in bright red\n- Delicate white and yellow flowers with red accents\n- Pale yellow flowers with multiple layers of petals\n\nThe foliage includes:\n- Various shades of green leaves, from light mint to deeper forest green\n- Some leaves have a more rounded shape while others are more pointed or lobed\n\nThe overall composition creates a lush, tropical feel with its warm colors and abundant plant life. The style appears to be a modern take on traditional floral patterns, with a slightly abstract quality to the flower and leaf shapes. The arrangement of elements gives a sense of movement and flow across the surface.\n\nThis type of pattern would be suitable for fabric, wallpaper, or other decorative applications where a bold, nature-inspired design is desired.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a bright, vibrant floral pattern with various colors and decorative elements. The design creates a cheerful and lively atmosphere. The pattern is composed of numerous flowers, some larger and more prominent, while others are smaller and situated throughout the image.\n\nIn addition to the flowers, there is a bird flying through the air, adding an intriguing element to the scene. The combination of the flowers, the bird, and the vibrant colors makes the image visually appealing and captivating.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
