    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the building shown in the image. What makes the building special?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe building shown in the image is the Flatiron Building, located in New York City. \n\nWhat makes this building special is its unique triangular shape, which gives it its distinctive \"flat iron\" appearance. The Flatiron Building is one of New York's most recognizable and photographed landmarks. \n\nBuilt in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at the time and is considered a groundbreaking skyscraper. Its steel-frame structure and Beaux-Arts style facade with limestone and glazed terra-cotta cladding are notable architectural features.\n\nThe building's narrow wedge shape was designed to fit the triangular plot at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway. This unusual form creates a striking visual effect, especially when viewed from the narrow end, as shown in this image. The perspective emphasizes the building's height and its sharp, prow-like edge.\n\nThe Flatiron Building is not just architecturally significant but has also become an enduring symbol of New York City, featured in countless photographs, films, and artworks over the years.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe building depicted in the image is the Empire State Building, a famous skyscraper in New York City.
