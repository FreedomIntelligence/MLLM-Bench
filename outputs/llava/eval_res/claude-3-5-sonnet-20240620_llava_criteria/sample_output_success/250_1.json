    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two images closely to identify and compare the differences between them as many as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe two images show a brown and black dog in different poses and settings. The first image features the dog carrying a bottle in its mouth, with one paw on a bowl and the other paw on a cat. The dog appears to be placing the bottle into the bowl. The second image displays the dog with a bone in its mouth, standing next to a house.\n\nIn the first image, the dog is positioned more towards the left side, while in the second image, it is positioned more towards the right side. Although both images show the dog in action, there are some noticeable differences in the objects the dog is carrying and its surroundings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAfter examining the two images closely, I've identified the following differences:\n\n1. The dog's collar color: Blue in the left image, orange in the right image.\n\n2. The dog house door: Rectangular in the left image, circular in the right image.\n\n3. The dog bowl contents: Empty with a bone in the left image, filled with food in the right image.\n\n4. The number of flowers: Two flowers in the left image, one flower in the right image.\n\n5. The leaves near the dog house: Absent in the left image, present in the right image.\n\n6. The dog's tail: Slightly shorter in the left image, longer in the right image.\n\n7. The fence post on the far left: Has a knot in the left image, no knot in the right image.\n\n8. The grass patch in the foreground: Slightly larger in the right image.\n\n9. The dog's eye color: Blue in the left image, white in the right image.\n\n10. The shape of the dog's ear: Slightly rounder in the left image, more pointed in the right image.\n\nThese are the 10 differences I could spot between the two images.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in dog's eye, collar, posture of the dog's leg, bowl contents, flower, stone, fence knot, grass near the fence, dog house window, and bush.",
