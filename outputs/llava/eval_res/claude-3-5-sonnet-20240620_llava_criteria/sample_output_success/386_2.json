    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues in the image, what will be the possible action of the driver?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the visual cues in the image, the driver's possible actions are likely to be:\n\n1. Following GPS directions: There's a smartphone mounted on the dashboard displaying what appears to be a navigation app with a map. This suggests the driver may be following turn-by-turn directions to reach a destination.\n\n2. Driving forward: The view through the windshield shows an open road ahead with another vehicle in the distance, indicating the driver is likely to continue driving forward.\n\n3. Maintaining focus on the road: The driver's hand is on the steering wheel, suggesting they are actively controlling the vehicle and should be focusing on the road conditions and traffic ahead.\n\n4. Potentially entering or exiting a parking structure: The image shows what looks like pillars or supports of a structure, possibly a parking garage or covered area. The driver may be navigating through or preparing to enter/exit such a space.\n\n5. Adjusting to lighting changes: If the vehicle is indeed moving between a covered area and an open space, the driver may need to adjust to changing light conditions.\n\n6. Monitoring the vehicle's dashboard: The car's dashboard is visible, so the driver may be checking speed, fuel levels, or other vehicle information as needed while driving.\n\nThe primary action, however, appears to be following a predetermined route using GPS navigation while driving attentively.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nLooking at the visual cues, the driver is likely to follow the directions displayed on the phone, possibly to find a specific destination or to reach a nearby place. The driver is holding the cell phone in the car, and it is connected to a dash mount, which suggests that they will be using the phone's navigation system for guidance. The driver is responsible for safely maintaining their attention on the road while relying on this system to navigate the city.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes \"slow down till stop\" or \"turn left to adjacent lane\" based on visual cues.\n2. Response must consider traffic conditions and road layout visible in the image.\n3. Answer must be logically consistent with the driver's possible actions in the given context.",
