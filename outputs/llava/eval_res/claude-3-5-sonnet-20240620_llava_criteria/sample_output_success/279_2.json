    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyzing the pairwise relationships between all characters in the diagram.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows three individuals in a festive setting with colorful decorations. Let's analyze the pairwise relationships between the cartoon characters depicted on their masks or held items:\n\n1. Dog (on left) and Zebra (held by left figure):\n   - Both are animals\n   - Different species (mammal connection)\n   - Both have simple, cartoonish designs\n\n2. Dog (on left) and Cat (on center figure's head):\n   - Both are common household pets\n   - Often depicted as having a rivalry in popular culture\n   - Both have rounded face shapes in this cartoon style\n\n3. Dog (on left) and Pig (held by center figure):\n   - Both are domesticated animals\n   - Different species but both mammals\n   - Both have smiling expressions\n\n4. Dog (on left) and Pig (held by right figure):\n   - Same analysis as the previous pig character\n\n5. Zebra and Cat:\n   - Both are animals\n   - Zebra is wild, cat is domesticated\n   - Contrasting color schemes (black/white vs. yellow)\n\n6. Zebra and Pig (held by center):\n   - Both are mammals\n   - Different habitats (wild vs. farm)\n   - Both have simple, friendly expressions\n\n7. Zebra and Pig (held by right):\n   - Same analysis as the previous pig character\n\n8. Cat and Pig (held by center):\n   - Both are often found on farms\n   - Different sizes in reality, but similar size in cartoon form\n   - Both have round face shapes\n\n9. Cat and Pig (held by right):\n   - Same analysis as the previous pig character\n\n10. Pig (held by center) and Pig (held by right):\n    - Identical characters\n    - Represent the same animal\n    - Slight color variation (one seems more orange-tinted)\n\nThese cartoon characters all share a common aesthetic of simple, friendly designs with large eyes and smiling expressions, fitting the cheerful atmosphere of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, three people are standing together, possibly celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. The woman and two kids are holding up cow-shaped and possibly horse-shaped hats, which could be part of a party theme or decoration. The pairwise relationships between the characters are as follows:\n\n1. The woman is standing in the middle.\n2. The two kids are on either side of her, with one on her left and the other on her right.\n\nThese three people create a cohesive group, likely enjoying a fun and memorable event together.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the relationship in a pairwise fashion.\n2. Use social cues like body language, attire, and props for reasoning.\n3. Avoid definitive statements of the relationships.",
