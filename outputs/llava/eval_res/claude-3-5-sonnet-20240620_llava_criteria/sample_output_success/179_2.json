    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nFind the bounding box of the dog. The image size is 1300*923\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image dimensions provided (1300x923) and the position of the dog in the image, I estimate the bounding box for the dog to be approximately:\n\nX: 100\nY: 400\nWidth: 500\nHeight: 350\n\nThis bounding box encompasses the entire dog from its nose to the tip of its tail, and from the top of its head to its paws. The dog is lying on a shaggy white rug near a dark-colored sofa, taking up roughly the lower left quarter of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n[0.12, 0.42, 0.37, 0.81]\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify and outline the dog's entire form within the image.\n2. Exclude any non-dog elements from the bounding box.\n3. Ensure the bounding box is the correct size and shape for the dog's position.",
