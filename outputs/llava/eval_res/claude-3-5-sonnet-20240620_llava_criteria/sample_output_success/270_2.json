    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the two individuals smiling at each other?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the two men smiling at each other appear to be colleagues or business associates. They are dressed in business casual attire and seem to be at a professional event or conference, as evidenced by the Couchbase branded booth or stand visible in the foreground. Their body language and facial expressions suggest a friendly, positive interaction, possibly discussing business matters or networking. The setting and their engagement indicate they may be peers in the same industry or potential business partners meeting at this event. Their similar age and the casual yet professional nature of their interaction supports the idea that they could be long-time acquaintances in the same field, or perhaps meeting for the first time but finding common ground in their professional interests.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nGiven the presence of a white table with laptops behind the two men, it is likely that they have a professional relationship, possibly as colleagues or business partners. They could be collaborating on a project, discussing work matters or sharing ideas. The friendly exchange of smiles suggests a level of comfort and trust between them, which is common in professional contexts where individuals work or engage in business interactions together.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential relationship based on social cues (clothing, gestures, context).\n2. Justify relationship inference with visual elements (interaction, environment).",
