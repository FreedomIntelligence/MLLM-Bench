    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat do you think is the occupation of the man in this photograph, considering the traditional attire and the birds perched on the pole he is carrying?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGiven the man's traditional attire and the presence of birds perched on the pole he is carrying, it is likely that he is a fisherman or a bird catcher. The man appears to be using a boat to travel along a body of water, which is a common activity among fishermen. Additionally, the birds might be used to help him catch fish or other aquatic creatures, indicating that he might have some expertise in bird handling and training. This combination of elements suggests that the man's occupation is related to the water or wildlife, and he may be involved in fishing or bird catching as part of his daily activities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the person appears to be a traditional cormorant fisherman. This conclusion can be drawn from several elements in the photograph:\n\n1. Traditional attire: The individual is wearing a wide-brimmed hat and what looks like traditional clothing, which is consistent with the attire of cormorant fishermen in parts of Asia, particularly China.\n\n2. Birds on a pole: The long pole the person is carrying has several dark birds perched on it. These are likely cormorants, which are trained to catch fish.\n\n3. Setting: The person is standing on what appears to be a small wooden raft or boat in a river, with dramatic karst mountains in the background. This type of landscape is typical of areas in southern China where cormorant fishing is practiced.\n\n4. Equipment: Besides the pole with birds, there seems to be a basket or container visible, which would be used to hold caught fish.\n\nCormorant fishing is an ancient technique where fishermen use trained cormorants to catch fish in rivers and lakes. The birds dive into the water to catch fish, but a snare around their necks prevents them from swallowing larger fish, which the fisherman then retrieves.\n\nWhile this practice is less common today and often maintained more for tourism than as a primary fishing method, the image captures the traditional essence of this occupation in a strikingly picturesque setting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the man as a fisherman based on traditional attire and birds.\n2. Mention the pole and birds as indicators of the fishing occupation.\n3. Acknowledge the setting on a boat as supportive evidence of fishing activity.",
