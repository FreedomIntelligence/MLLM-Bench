    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical features of the twins to identify subtle differences that may distinguish them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe twins have similar physical features; however, there are subtle differences that can be observed. First, one twin has a mole on her face close to the left side of her nose, while the other has a slight gap between her eyebrows. Second, the twin on the left has longer hair, as it extends beyond the other girl's hair. These small distinctions in their features make them stand out despite their similar appearances.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two very similar-looking young individuals, likely twins, with blonde hair and blue eyes. While they appear nearly identical at first glance, there are some subtle differences:\n\n1. Facial shape: The individual on the left seems to have a slightly rounder face, while the one on the right has a marginally more oval face shape.\n\n2. Eyebrows: The left individual's eyebrows appear slightly fuller and more arched, while the right individual's eyebrows seem a bit straighter.\n\n3. Nose: The nose of the individual on the left appears slightly wider at the bridge, while the one on the right has a marginally narrower nose bridge.\n\n4. Freckles: The individual on the right seems to have more visible freckles across the nose and cheeks.\n\n5. Smile: While both are smiling, the individual on the right has a slightly wider smile, showing a bit more teeth.\n\n6. Hair parting: The left individual's hair seems to be parted slightly more to the side, while the right individual's hair appears more centrally parted.\n\n7. Eye shape: The eyes of the individual on the left appear slightly rounder, while those of the individual on the right seem a touch more almond-shaped.\n\nThese differences are very subtle, and it's important to note that lighting, angle, and expression can affect how these features appear in a photograph. Overall, the two individuals look remarkably similar, as one would expect with twins.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify facial feature differences such as freckle patterns, eye shape, or smile.\n2. Note hair texture, color variation, or hairstyle distinctions.\n3. Describe any other physical differences, like ear shape or skin tone.",
