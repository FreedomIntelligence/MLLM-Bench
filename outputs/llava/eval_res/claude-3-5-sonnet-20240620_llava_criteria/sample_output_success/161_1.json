    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, summarize the abstract in one sentence and explain the significance of this article.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe abstract describes a paper that highlights the importance of democratizing chatbot development by incorporating multiple languages, including English and Chinese, to allow chatbots to communicate with users across diverse linguistic backgrounds. This can be achieved by using innovative models such as Phoenix, which can enhance the performance of chatbots while reducing the learning time required. The significance of this article lies in promoting the use of chatbots in various languages, thus providing universal access and fostering global connections.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe abstract can be summarized in one sentence as follows:\n\nThe researchers have developed a large language model called 'Phoenix' that aims to democratize ChatGPT across multiple languages, particularly those with limited resources, while achieving competitive performance with existing open-source models.\n\nThe significance of this article lies in several key aspects:\n\n1. Multilingual accessibility: It addresses the need for AI language models that can perform well across various languages, not just dominant ones like English and Chinese.\n\n2. Focus on under-resourced languages: The model excels in languages with limited resources, including both Latin and non-Latin scripts, which is crucial for global inclusivity in AI technology.\n\n3. Democratization of AI: By making their model open-source and freely available, the researchers are working to make advanced language AI more accessible to people worldwide.\n\n4. Overcoming restrictions: The work aims to provide access to ChatGPT-like capabilities in countries where OpenAI's services might be restricted due to government regulations or other factors.\n\n5. Competitive performance: The model achieves performance comparable to existing open-source models in major languages while also performing well in less-resourced languages.\n\n6. Open collaboration: By releasing their data, code, and models publicly, the researchers are encouraging further development and improvement of multilingual AI models by the global research community.\n\nThis research represents a significant step towards making advanced language AI more inclusive and accessible on a global scale, potentially bridging linguistic divides in AI technology access and capabilities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Summarize the abstract in one sentence, mentioning 'Phoenix', 'democratize ChatGPT', and 'languages'.\n2. Explain the significance, focusing on accessibility in 'resource-limited' areas and 'non-Latin languages'.",
