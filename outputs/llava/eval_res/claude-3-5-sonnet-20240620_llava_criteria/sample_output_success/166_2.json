    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main point of this headline is that anti-Israel activists are tearing down posters of hostages, which the New York Post characterizes as \"petty acts of hate\" and a lack of decency.\n\nThis headline relates to the broader context of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict that escalated dramatically in October 2023. Following Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in numerous Israeli casualties and hostages taken, there has been intense fighting in Gaza and heightened tensions globally.\n\nThe hostage posters mentioned likely refer to images of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7 attack. These posters have been put up in many cities around the world to raise awareness about the hostages' plight and call for their release.\n\nThe act of tearing down these posters has become a contentious issue, with some viewing it as an anti-Semitic act or a show of support for Hamas, while others might see it as a form of protest against Israeli actions in Gaza.\n\nThe newspaper's framing of this act as hateful and indecent reflects the highly polarized nature of public discourse surrounding the conflict, where actions are often interpreted through starkly different lenses depending on one's political stance.\n\nThe additional headline at the bottom, \"Hamas vows to kill Jews 'again and again',\" further emphasizes the newspaper's perspective on the conflict and the threat posed by Hamas.\n\nThis coverage demonstrates how local actions (tearing down posters in New York) can be directly connected to and influenced by international conflicts, highlighting the global impact of the Israel-Hamas war and its ability to spark controversy and division far beyond the immediate conflict zone.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3. Assess relevance and accuracy of external knowledge used in explanation.",
