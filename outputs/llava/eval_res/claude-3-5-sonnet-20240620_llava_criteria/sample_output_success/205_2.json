    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich squares are immediately accessible to the black knight, given its current position on the board?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the black knight is positioned on what appears to be the d5 square (assuming the bottom-right corner of the visible board is h1). \n\nGiven the L-shaped movement of a knight in chess, the squares immediately accessible to this black knight would be:\n\n1. b6 (two squares up, one square left)\n2. c7 (two squares left, one square up)\n3. e7 (two squares right, one square up)\n4. f6 (two squares up, one square right)\n5. f4 (two squares right, one square down)\n6. e3 (two squares down, one square right)\n7. c3 (two squares down, one square left)\n8. b4 (two squares left, one square down)\n\nIt's worth noting that some of these squares may be occupied by other pieces, which would prevent the knight from moving there in an actual game situation, but these are all the squares that are theoretically accessible to the knight from its current position.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a black knight situated on the board and appears to be on top of a pawn. There are five squares surrounding the knight that are immediately accessible to it without moving any other pieces. From its current position, the knight can access:\n\n1. A2 - one square to the right, one square down\n2. B3 - two squares to the right, two squares up\n3. C2 - one square to the right, one square down\n4. D3 - one square to the right, one square up\n5. E2 - one square to the right, one square down\n\nIt is important to note that the knight can only move in a L-shape pattern (two squares along a horizontal or vertical axis and one square diagonally), and it must pass through the square occupied by the pawn. There might be other additional squares accessible after the knight moves through the pawn, but the image does not provide enough information for a detailed analysis of all possible squares.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List squares a5, a7, b4, b8, d4, d8, e5, e7 as knight's accessible positions.\n2. Ensure answer reflects understanding of knight's L-shaped movement.",
