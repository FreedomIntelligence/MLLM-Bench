    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend prediction image, determine the trend shown in the image is reasonable.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image is clearly meant to be a humorous and exaggerated representation of chicken breeding trends, not a realistic prediction. The top half shows the actual historical trend of chicken breeding from 1957 to 2005, depicting how chickens have become larger and meatier over time due to selective breeding practices in the poultry industry.\n\nThe bottom half of the image takes this trend to an absurd extreme for comedic effect. It suggests that chickens will continue to evolve rapidly, growing larger and more dinosaur-like until they essentially become Tyrannosaurus rex by 2025. This is obviously not a reasonable or realistic prediction.\n\nIn reality, while chicken breeding has indeed led to larger birds over the decades, the rate and extent of change shown in the image's prediction is grossly exaggerated. Biological and genetic limitations would prevent chickens from evolving into dinosaur-like creatures, especially not in such a short timeframe.\n\nThis image is likely meant to be a satirical commentary on the intensive breeding practices in the poultry industry, using humor to draw attention to how much chickens have changed over time due to human intervention. While it makes a point about the significant changes in chicken physiology due to selective breeding, the predicted trend is not at all reasonable or scientifically plausible.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the size of chickens over time. The image features a graph with several chicken sizes, including an oversized chicken, dinosaurs, and a rooster that has impregnated a dinosaur. The trend is presented in a humorous and exaggerated manner, showing chickens growing in size to become like dinosaurs.\n\nThe trend is likely a fantasy or a parody, as it is unrealistic for chickens to grow to the size of dinosaurs in actuality. The graph and the rooster impregnating a dinosaur are not scientifically plausible, and therefore, the trend is not reasonable. The image is meant to be humorous and entertaining, rather than providing accurate information about the growth of chickens over time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the answer identifies the trend as unreasonable.\n2. Assess the logical explanation for why the trend is unreasonable.\n3. Evaluate the consistency of the answer with the image's content.",
