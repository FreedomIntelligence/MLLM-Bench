    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIs it possible for the player in the image to score points in the next 0.1 second?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nNo, it's not possible for the player to score points in the next 0.1 seconds based on this image. The player is shown dribbling the ball up the court, not in a shooting position. He's in the middle of the court, far from the basket, and would need more than a fraction of a second to get into a scoring position or attempt a shot. Basketball plays typically take several seconds to develop, even for fast breaks or quick shots. The player's current posture and position on the court indicate he's in the process of advancing the ball, not immediately preparing to score.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSince the basketball player in the image is running with the ball, it is likely that he is attempting to score points in the next 0.1 second. However, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of his attempt without further information about the current game situation or his performance at that moment. The player's chances of scoring depend on factors such as the position of his teammates and opponents, his own skill level, and his ability to make quick decisions and execute the right moves.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the player's body and ball position suggest imminent scoring action.\n2. Determine proximity to the basket and potential defenders' positions.\n3. Evaluate movement direction and momentum for scoring likelihood: impossible",
