Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExtract the definitions (def) and examples (ex) from the notes, and record the formulas using LaTeX.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are the definitions, examples, and formulas extracted from the notes:\n\nDef:\n- An n×n matrix A is an orthogonal transformation if and only if:\n  - It has n mutually perpendicular rows or columns with unit length\n  - Rows must be independent (can't be multiples of each other)\n  - The rows or columns of A form an orthonormal basis of ℝⁿ\n\nEx:\n- [1 2] → linearly dependent\n  [3 6]\n- [1 2] → independent but not ⊥\n  [2 6]\n- ex: [1 2 3]ᵀ = [1 4]\n                [2 5]\n                [3 6]\n\nFormulas (in LaTeX):\n\n1.
