    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical characteristics that are typical for the species and breeds of the animals in the image, such as coat type and ear shape\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows three young animals: two dogs and one cat. Let's compare their physical characteristics:\n\n1. Jack Russell Terrier (left):\n- Coat: Short, smooth, and predominantly white with brown patches\n- Ears: Folded, triangular shape\n- Body: Compact and muscular\n- Face: Short muzzle with a distinct brown patch over one eye\n\n2. Maine Coon kitten (center):\n- Coat: Long, fluffy, and orange with lighter undercoat\n- Ears: Large and pointed with tufts of fur at the tips\n- Body: Sturdy build, even as a kitten\n- Face: Slightly elongated muzzle, large eyes\n\n3. Labrador Retriever puppy (right):\n- Coat: Short, dense, and light cream/yellow in color\n- Ears: Floppy and pendant-shaped\n- Body: Sturdy and well-proportioned\n- Face: Broad head with a medium-length muzzle\n\nComparing the characteristics:\n- Coat types vary significantly: the Jack Russell has a short, smooth coat; the Maine Coon has a long, fluffy coat; and the Labrador has a short, dense coat.\n- Ear shapes differ: pointed for the cat, folded for the Jack Russell, and floppy for the Labrador.\n- The Maine Coon kitten has distinctively large ears with tufts, a breed-specific trait.\n- The dogs have shorter muzzles compared to the cat's slightly elongated face.\n- Color variations are evident: the Jack Russell is bi-colored, the Maine Coon is orange, and the Labrador is a solid light color.\n\nThese differences highlight the distinct characteristics of each breed and species, showcasing the diversity in domestic pets.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features three puppies and a kitten, showcasing a mix of species and breeds. The puppies present in the image can be characterized by their furry coats and dog-like features, such as pointy ears and a muzzle. The cat, on the other hand, is characterized by its sleek, furry coat, large pointy ears, and, of course, a more elongated body. The ears of the dogs are pointed upwards, which is a typical characteristic of many dog breeds, whereas the cat has large, pointed ears, which is a more cat-like feature. By comparing these physical characteristics, one can appreciate the differences between the animals and their respective species and breeds.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare coat types: smooth white with tan patches, fluffy long-haired, soft short cream-colored.\n2. Compare ear shapes: partially folded, pointed and floppy.",
