    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, infer the type of event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the event taking place is clearly an election or voting process. This can be inferred from several key elements in the picture:\n\n1. Voting booths: There are multiple white privacy booths set up in a row, which are typical of polling stations.\n\n2. American flags: The booths are decorated with American flag imagery, which is common in U.S. elections.\n\n3. \"VOTE\" text: The word \"VOTE\" is prominently displayed on the side of one of the booths, explicitly indicating the purpose of these stations.\n\n4. People participating: We can see individuals using the voting booths, engaged in the act of voting.\n\n5. Indoor setting: The event is taking place in what appears to be a public indoor space, which is often used as a polling location during elections.\n\nAll these elements together strongly indicate that this is an election day event, where citizens are casting their votes in a U.S. election.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, where several people are standing in front of voting booths with American flags nearby and are using electronic voting machines, it can be inferred that a political event is taking place. This event could be a primary election, a caucus, or another type of electoral process. The presence of a crowd and the use of electronic voting equipment indicate that the event is organized and possibly has a significant impact on the public's political choices or decisions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as an election based on visual cues such as voting booths and flags.\n2. Mention the presence of people casting votes to support the event type.\n3. Note any signage or symbols that directly indicate voting or elections.",
