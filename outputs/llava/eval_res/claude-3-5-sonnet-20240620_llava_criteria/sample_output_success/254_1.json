    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere are two images of a penguin sitting in the snow. The first image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and catching a fish, while the second image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and preparing to catch a fish. There are many fish in both pictures, but their positions are different. On the left, the fish are near the top-right side, and on the right, the fish are closer to the penguin. The penguin appears to be the same in both images, with no noticeable differences in its appearance. Overall, there are five differences in the image pairs, including the fish's positions, the fishing pole's orientation, and the fish's visibility.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAfter examining the two images of the penguin, I've found 5 differences between them:\n\n1. Fishing rod: In the left image, the penguin's fishing rod has no bait or fish on it. In the right image, there's a small red fish on the fishing line.\n\n2. Penguin's feet: The left penguin has three orange toes on each foot. The right penguin has one yellow toe on its visible foot.\n\n3. Ice/snow: The ice or snow formation in the background on the left is slightly taller and more pointed than the one on the right.\n\n4. Water: The waves in the water on the left image are more pronounced and numerous compared to the right image.\n\n5. Cloud: There's a small cloud in the upper left corner of the left image that is missing in the right image.\n\nThese are the five differences I've identified between the two penguin images.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences in penguin's left foot color, ice hole size, background iceberg, fishing line buoys, and penguin tail.",
