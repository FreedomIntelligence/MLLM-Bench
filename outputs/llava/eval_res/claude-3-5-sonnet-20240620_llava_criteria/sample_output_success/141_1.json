    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss how the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character through various elements that contribute to the overall effect. The man is wearing a clown costume, which already has a humorous and exaggerated look. He is also dressed like a jester, further emphasizing the comedic nature of his appearance. Additionally, he is wearing a funny hat and a beard, adding to the overall goofy and lighthearted vibe of the character.\n\nThe individual's expression contributes to the comedic effect of the scene. He is making a funny face, likely indicating that he is posing for a joke or entertaining others. His wide open eyes and the playful pose make the character even more amusing.\n\nLastly, the man is holding a cup or a metal mug, which could be used as a prop for his humorous act or a drink for a celebration. All these elements work together to create a comedic character that is visually entertaining and engaging.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image presents a wonderfully comedic character through a combination of an elaborate costume, quirky accessories, and a bemused facial expression.\n\nThe costume is a riot of colors and patterns, featuring a jester-like hat with bells, a multi-colored patchwork jacket, and various layers of clashing fabrics. This over-the-top ensemble immediately signals that this character is not to be taken seriously and is meant to evoke laughter.\n\nThe accessories further enhance the comedic effect. Multiple strands of beaded necklaces, an assortment of buttons with humorous messages like \"Idiot!\" and \"Mostly Harmless,\" and a small bell dangling from the hat all contribute to the character's whimsical appearance. The person is also holding what appears to be a metal tankard, adding to the festive and slightly absurd atmosphere.\n\nThe facial expression ties everything together perfectly. The individual sports a full beard and a slightly raised eyebrow, conveying a look of mild surprise or bemusement. This expression suggests that the character is aware of their own ridiculousness, inviting the viewer to share in the joke.\n\nThe combination of the outlandish costume, the playful accessories, and the knowing facial expression creates a character that seems to embody the spirit of a jester or fool – someone whose purpose is to entertain and make others laugh through their appearance and demeanor. The overall effect is one of good-natured humor and self-deprecation, inviting the audience to smile along with this comedic creation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated features of the costume and accessories that contribute to humor.\n2. Describe how the individual's expression enhances the comedic effect of the attire.\n3. Explain the synergy between costume, accessories, and expression in creating a comedic character.",
