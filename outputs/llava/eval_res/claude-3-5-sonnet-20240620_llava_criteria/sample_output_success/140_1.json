    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis meme employs situational irony and absurdist humor. Let's break down the elements:\n\n1. Contrast: The meme sets up a contrast between the two characters in the car. One person excitedly points out a dog, while the other expresses a dislike for dogs.\n\n2. Unexpected twist: The humor comes from the sudden appearance of a dog in the backseat, directly contradicting the second person's stated preference.\n\n3. Visual humor: The image of the grumpy-looking dog squeezed into the backseat adds to the comedic effect.\n\n4. Text overlay: The driver's exclamation \"This is the way!\" adds to the absurdity of the situation, suggesting he's pleased with this turn of events.\n\n5. Pop culture reference: The \"This is the way!\" phrase might be a nod to the popular TV series \"The Mandalorian,\" adding a layer of intertextuality.\n\nThe primary type of humor here is situational irony, where the outcome is contrary to what one would expect based on the initial setup. There's also an element of absurdism in the unexpected appearance of the dog and the driver's enthusiastic response to the situation.\n\nThe meme plays on the common experience of relationship dynamics and differing preferences, exaggerating it to a comical degree. The humor derives from the subversion of expectations and the absurd resolution to the conflict presented in the first panel.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
