    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the visual symptoms in detail and estimate the stage of the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a young child is looking at the camera with red spots on their skin, particularly on their face. These red spots are likely indicative of a rash or an outbreak of hives. Hives are often caused by an allergic reaction, irritation, or an infection. It is difficult to precisely determine the stage of the condition from the image alone, as the severity, size, and distribution of the rash can vary. However, given that the child is looking at the camera, it is possible that the rash is not too severe or extensive, allowing the child to maintain focus and comfort in the presence of the photographer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a young child with visible skin symptoms that appear to be consistent with atopic dermatitis, commonly known as eczema. The visual symptoms include:\n\n1. Redness: There are noticeable areas of redness on the cheeks and around the mouth.\n2. Raised bumps: The affected areas show slightly raised, inflamed patches.\n3. Dry skin: The skin appears dry and potentially flaky in the affected areas.\n4. Distribution: The symptoms are primarily concentrated on the face, particularly the cheeks and around the mouth, which is a common pattern for eczema in young children.\n\nBased on the visible symptoms, this appears to be a moderate stage of atopic dermatitis. The reasons for this assessment are:\n\n1. The affected areas are clearly defined and noticeable, but do not cover the entire face.\n2. The redness is pronounced but not severe or extremely inflamed.\n3. There are no visible signs of bleeding, cracking, or oozing, which would indicate a more severe stage.\n4. The child's skin condition, while obviously irritated, does not appear to be causing extreme distress.\n\nIt's important to note that proper diagnosis and staging of atopic dermatitis should be done by a medical professional, as they can assess other factors not visible in a single image, such as the duration of symptoms, the child's overall health, and any other affected areas of the body.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe visible skin symptoms (e.g., rash, discoloration).\n2. Estimate condition stage based on visual symptoms severity.\n3. Include no diagnosis, focus on symptom description and stage estimation.",
