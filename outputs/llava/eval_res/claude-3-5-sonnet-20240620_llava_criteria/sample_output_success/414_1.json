    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a dense caption detailing the various constellations depicted in the historical star map, including their names, the shapes they are associated with, and any notable stars or celestial objects contained within them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe historical star map depicts various constellations in a large circle. These constellations are named after the celestial objects they represent or are associated with. Some of the constellations include Orion, which is known for its prominent hunter figure with a shield and club. Another notable constellation is Cetus, which is shaped like a sea monster and contains the star Mirach. Additionally, there is Lepus, a small constellation situated near Orion, with a hare as its mascot. The diverse shapes and names of the constellations, along with the inclusion of notable stars like Mirach, make this historical star map fascinating and a testament to the rich history of celestial observations and cataloguing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis historical star map is a rich tapestry of celestial imagery, depicting numerous constellations in intricate detail. The circular map is divided into segments representing the zodiac signs and other constellations, each illustrated with its mythological figure or associated animal.\n\nStarting from the top, we see Pisces (the Fish), represented by two fish connected by a cord. Moving clockwise, Aries (the Ram) is depicted with its curved horns. Triangulus (the Triangle) appears as a small geometric shape nearby.\n\nPegasus, the winged horse, dominates a large portion of the upper right quadrant, while Andromeda, depicted as a female figure, is positioned below it. Perseus, shown wielding a sword, is located to the left of Andromeda.\n\nCassiopeia, represented by a seated figure, is visible in the upper left portion. Below it, we find Auriga (the Charioteer) holding reins. The twins of Gemini are illustrated in the left side of the map.\n\nIn the center, Ursa Major (the Great Bear) is prominently featured, with its distinctive shape of the Big Dipper clearly visible. Nearby, Ursa Minor (the Little Bear) can be seen.\n\nLeo (the Lion) is depicted in the lower left quadrant, with its mane and tail clearly illustrated. Virgo (the Virgin) is shown as a winged figure in the bottom portion of the map.\n\nLibra (the Scales) is represented by its balance symbol in the lower right. Above it, we see Hercules depicted as a kneeling figure. Nearby, Ophiuchus (the Serpent Bearer) is shown grappling with a large serpent.\n\nOther notable constellations include Draco (the Dragon) winding through the northern sky, Cygnus (the Swan) with its distinctive cross shape, and Aquila (the Eagle) spreading its wings.\n\nThe map is framed by a circular border marked with degrees, likely representing celestial coordinates. Latin inscriptions and labels identify various stars and constellations throughout the image.\n\nThis star map is a beautiful example of historical celestial cartography, blending scientific observation with artistic representation of mythological figures associated with the constellations.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify constellations by name and describe their shapes accurately.\n2. Mention any notable stars or celestial objects within the constellations.\n3. Ensure the description is detailed, reflecting the historical context of the star map.",
