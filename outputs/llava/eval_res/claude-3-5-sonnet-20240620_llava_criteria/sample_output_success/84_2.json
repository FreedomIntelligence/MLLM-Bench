    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a tropical fish in an aquarium setting. Here are the key features to help recognize it:\n\n1. Body shape: The fish has a rounded, disc-like body typical of many reef-dwelling species.\n\n2. Color: Its body is primarily a greenish-yellow color, with a striking blue face or \"mask\" around its mouth area.\n\n3. Fins: The fish has visible dark fins, particularly noticeable is the tail fin which appears fan-like and somewhat translucent.\n\n4. Mouth: It has a prominent, slightly protruding mouth with thick lips, giving it an almost pouty expression.\n\n5. Eyes: Small, dark eyes are visible on the side of its head.\n\n6. Size: While it's difficult to determine exact size from the image, the fish appears to be of medium size for an aquarium fish, perhaps 4-6 inches in length.\n\n7. Posture: In the image, the fish is swimming at a slight upward angle, with its mouth pointing upwards.\n\n8. Habitat: The fish is in a clear aquarium with a blue-green background, suggesting a tropical marine environment.\n\nThis fish appears to be a species of parrotfish or wrasse, known for their bright colors and distinctive \"beak-like\" mouths used for scraping algae off coral reefs.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
