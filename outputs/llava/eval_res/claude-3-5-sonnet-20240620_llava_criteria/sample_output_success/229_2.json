    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the relationship between two birds in the image, what kind of natural relation do they show?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a clear parent-offspring relationship between the two birds. The larger bird on the left appears to be an adult, likely a robin or similar species, with brown and orange plumage. It is leaning towards a much larger, fluffier bird on the right, which is clearly a chick or juvenile.\n\nThe adult bird is feeding the young one, as evidenced by the open beak of the chick and the adult's beak inserted into it. This is a classic example of parental care in birds, where the parent provides food to its offspring.\n\nThe chick appears to be at the nestling or fledgling stage, with developing feathers that are primarily gray and white, giving it a mottled appearance. It's much larger than the adult, which is typical for many bird species at this stage of development. The chick's size and appearance suggest it's nearly ready to leave the nest but still dependent on its parents for food.\n\nThis image captures a fundamental aspect of avian biology - the intensive parental care that many bird species provide to their young. It showcases the natural instinct of the parent to nurture and feed its offspring, ensuring its survival and growth until it can fend for itself.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are two birds, one small and one large. They are perched together on a tree branch with the small bird having its mouth open and the larger bird leaning over to feed it. This scene demonstrates a nurturing relationship between the two birds, where the larger one is providing food and care for the smaller bird. This is a natural behavior observed in many bird species, particularly when parent birds feed their offspring or when one bird helps another in times of need. The fact that the larger bird is feeding the smaller bird signifies a bonding experience and cooperation between the two species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify brood parasitism as the natural relationship depicted.",
