    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image depicts a scene of utter chaos with extensive damage visible throughout. Could you surmise which type of natural disaster has befallen this village?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image suggests that a major flood has taken place in the village. People are seen walking in the floodwaters, and the destruction appears to be extensive, with buildings surrounded by rough water, vehicles submerged, and debris scattered around. The force of the floodwater and the extent of the destruction indicate that this is a severe natural disaster, impacting the lives of the residents and the overall infrastructure of the village.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, it appears that this village has been struck by a typhoon or hurricane. Several key indicators point to this conclusion:\n\n1. Flooding: The street is completely submerged in water, suggesting heavy rainfall and storm surge.\n\n2. Wind damage: Palm trees are bent and damaged, indicating extremely strong winds.\n\n3. Structural damage: Buildings on both sides of the street show significant damage, consistent with the effects of powerful winds and flying debris.\n\n4. Power line damage: Utility poles are leaning and wires are hanging, typical of storm damage to infrastructure.\n\n5. Debris: There's a large amount of debris floating in the water and strewn about, which is common after a major storm.\n\n6. Atmospheric conditions: The sky appears overcast and misty, which could be the aftermath of a major storm system.\n\n7. Coastal setting: The presence of palm trees suggests this is a coastal area, which are often vulnerable to typhoons or hurricanes.\n\nThe combination of flooding, wind damage, and the coastal setting strongly suggests that a typhoon (in the Pacific) or hurricane (in the Atlantic) has recently passed through this area, causing widespread destruction and flooding.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the natural disaster as a flood, based on water inundation and damage.\n2. Mention visible flood characteristics: fast-flowing water, debris, and affected buildings.",
