    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe animal is a colorful bird with a striking appearance. It has a black and orange body, a white head, blue eyes, and a long beak. The bird's beak is quite large, and it seems to be stretching or yawning its mouth while perched on a tree branch. The bird's vibrant colors and unique features make it easily distinguishable and visually interesting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a toucan, a distinctive and colorful tropical bird. Here are the key features to help recognize it:\n\n1. Beak: The most prominent feature is its large, elongated beak. The beak is dark, curved downward, and disproportionately large compared to its body.\n\n2. Coloration: The toucan has a striking color pattern:\n   - Black feathers cover most of its body, including its back, wings, and tail.\n   - A vibrant yellow patch covers its throat and upper chest.\n   - There's a bright orange area on its lower chest.\n   - The face area around the beak is white.\n\n3. Eyes: It has a light blue ring around its eye, which stands out against the black feathers.\n\n4. Body shape: The bird has a compact body with a relatively short neck and a long tail.\n\n5. Posture: In this image, the toucan is perched on a tree branch, gripping it with its feet.\n\n6. Size: While it's hard to determine exact size from this image, toucans are generally medium-sized birds, larger than typical songbirds but smaller than most birds of prey.\n\n7. Habitat: The background suggests a tropical forest environment, which is the natural habitat for toucans.\n\nThese features, especially the oversized, colorful beak and the distinctive black, yellow, and orange coloration, make the toucan one of the most recognizable birds in the world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention toucans' large, colorful bills as a distinctive feature.\n2. Describe additional attributes: body color, size, and any unique markings.\n3. Include the setting or behavior if it aids in recognition.",
