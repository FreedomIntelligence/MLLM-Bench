    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEngage in speculation regarding the age group to which the black girl in white in the picture likely belongs, considering the context of the event depicted\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the context of the image, which appears to be a school or community event in a gymnasium, the individual in the white shirt seems to be of elementary or middle school age, likely between 9-13 years old. The setting suggests this is some kind of fair or exhibition, possibly related to education or extracurricular activities. The person's height and build, as well as their interaction with others around them who appear to be of similar age, supports this estimation. However, it's important to note that age can be difficult to determine precisely from an image alone.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a group of people, including a black girl in a white shirt, gathered around tables at an event. Since this event appears to be a school function, it is plausible that the black girl in white might belong to a younger age group, such as elementary or middle school students. The presence of multiple people participating in the event, as well as the presence of tables and chairs, further supports the notion that this is a school-related event.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes speculation on girl's age group: elementary or middle school.",
