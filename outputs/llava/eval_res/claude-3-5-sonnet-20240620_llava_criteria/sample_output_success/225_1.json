    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the linear flow of energy in these food chains.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays several food chains, showing the linear flow of energy from plants to animals. These food chains include a carnivorous plant, such as a Venus flytrap and an aquatic plant like a water lily, both of which consume smaller organisms as their primary food source. The linear flow of energy is evident as the smaller organisms, such as insects or small fish, are consumed by larger organisms, like predators or carnivorous plants. The larger organisms, in turn, may be preyed upon by even larger animals, like lions or eagles. The image emphasizes the interconnection and dependency of various species in the ecosystem and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and healthy environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows three different food chains, each demonstrating the linear flow of energy in an ecosystem:\n\n1. The first food chain starts with trees as the primary producer. The energy flows from the trees to a deer (primary consumer), which then flows to a lion (secondary consumer and top predator in this chain).\n\n2. The second food chain begins with a flower as the primary producer. The energy then flows to flies (primary consumer), then to a frog (secondary consumer), followed by a snake (tertiary consumer), and finally to an eagle (quaternary consumer and top predator).\n\n3. The third food chain starts with aquatic plants or flowers as the primary producer. The energy then flows to small fishes (primary consumers), then to a larger fish (secondary consumer), and finally to birds like a pelican (tertiary consumer and top predator in this chain).\n\nIn each of these food chains, the energy flows in a linear fashion from the primary producers (plants) through various levels of consumers, with each successive level typically representing a higher trophic level in the ecosystem. This linear progression demonstrates how energy is transferred from one organism to another in a simplified representation of ecosystem dynamics.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The first chain: trees -> deers -> lion\n2. The second chain: flower -> flies -> frog -> snake -> eagle.\n3. The third chain: flower -> small fishes -> larger fish -> birds.\n4. There is no strict format in describing each chain. However, the answer should explicitly and accurately points out every element on each chain.",
