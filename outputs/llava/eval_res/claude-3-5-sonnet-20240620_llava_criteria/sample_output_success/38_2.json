    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nI'm afraid I can't definitively determine the authenticity of this specific badge without having access to official standards for Mayberry sheriff badges to compare it against. However, I can describe the badge's design elements in detail:\n\nThe badge is a six-pointed star shape typical of many sheriff badges. It appears to be made of a silver-colored metal with a polished finish. The border of the star is decorated with raised circular studs.\n\nThe text on the badge reads \"SHERIFF\" at the top in large black letters, and \"MAYBERRY\" at the bottom in slightly smaller black letters. Both words are curved to follow the shape of the star.\n\nIn the center of the badge is a large five-pointed star, which is a common symbol used on law enforcement badges.\n\nThe design includes some decorative elements, such as a fan-like pattern above the central star and textured areas giving the badge a more ornate appearance.\n\nThe overall craftsmanship appears to be of high quality, with clean lines and well-defined details.\n\nWithout specific knowledge of authentic Mayberry sheriff badges, I cannot make a definitive statement on this badge's authenticity. However, its design elements are consistent with many real sheriff badges. To determine authenticity, one would need to compare it to official Mayberry badge specifications or consult with local authorities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
