    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the building in the picture? To which period can its construction be traced back to?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe structure in the image is the Great Wall of China. It's not a single building, but rather a series of fortifications and walls that stretch across the northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China.\n\nThe construction of the Great Wall can be traced back to various periods in Chinese history, with different sections built and rebuilt over many centuries. The earliest construction began during the 7th century BCE. However, the most well-known and best-preserved sections of the wall, like the one shown in this image, were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE).\n\nThe image shows a section of the wall snaking across mountainous terrain, with its iconic watchtowers and steps. The wall is surrounded by autumn foliage, creating a beautiful contrast between the stone structure and the colorful landscape. This particular view is likely of a restored section that's popular with tourists, as evidenced by the people visible walking along the wall.\n\nWhile the Great Wall's construction spans over 2,000 years, the majority of what remains visible today dates from the Ming Dynasty period, making it around 500-600 years old.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe building in the picture is an ancient, large, and historic structure, likely a castle or a fortress. Its construction can be traced back to the Xi'an period in China, which dates back to around the 11th century. It has a unique design, featuring a high stone wall lining its side and a distinctive stepped appearance. The steepness of the wall and its impressive height make it a fascinating sight and a testament to the architectural and engineering prowess of the time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the building as the Great Wall.\n2. Trace the construction period back to the 7th century BC (Spring and Autumn period).",
