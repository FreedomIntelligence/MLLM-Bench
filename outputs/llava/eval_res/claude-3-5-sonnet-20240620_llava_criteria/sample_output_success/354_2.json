    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image is AI-generated. There are several clues that indicate this:\n\n1. Unrealistic scale: The tsunami wave is disproportionately large compared to the buildings, which is not physically possible.\n\n2. Inconsistent physics: The wave's behavior doesn't match real-world fluid dynamics. A wave of that size would cause massive destruction before reaching that height over the city.\n\n3. Mixed elements: The cityscape looks like a real photograph, but the wave appears to be digitally added and doesn't integrate naturally with the environment.\n\n4. Impossible details: There are objects visible in the wave (like cars) that wouldn't realistically be suspended in that manner.\n\n5. Overall composition: The dramatic scene is designed for visual impact rather than realism, which is common in AI-generated imagery.\n\n6. Image quality: There's a slight inconsistency in the resolution and detail between the wave and the buildings, suggesting composite elements.\n\n7. Lack of real-world context: An event of this magnitude would be well-documented if real, but this image doesn't correspond to any known tsunami event.\n\nThese factors combined strongly suggest that this is a digital creation, likely generated by AI, combining elements of real cityscapes with fantastical disaster imagery.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
