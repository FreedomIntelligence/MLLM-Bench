    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the visual design elements of the monsters, such as texture, coloration, and body structure.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts two colossal monsters engaged in combat, with distinct visual design elements:\n\nMonster on the left (reptilian creature):\n- Texture: Rough, scaly skin with numerous sharp, protruding spikes along its back and head\n- Coloration: Predominantly dark with hints of gold or bronze, giving it a metallic appearance\n- Body structure: Reptilian, dinosaur-like form with a large, bulky body, powerful limbs, and a long tail (implied but not fully visible)\n\nMonster on the right (ape-like creature):\n- Texture: Furry, with a mix of smooth skin and thick hair covering its body\n- Coloration: Dark brown to black fur, with exposed skin areas appearing to be a lighter tone\n- Body structure: Primate-like, with a muscular humanoid form, long arms, and a distinct ape-like head\n\nComparing the two:\n1. The reptilian monster has a more complex surface texture with scales and spikes, while the ape-like creature has a simpler fur-covered surface.\n2. The coloration of the reptilian monster is more varied and reflective, while the ape-like creature has a more uniform, matte coloration.\n3. The body structures are vastly different, with one being clearly reptilian and the other mammalian, reflecting their different evolutionary origins.\n4. The reptilian monster appears more armored and defensive in design, while the ape-like creature seems built for raw strength and agility.\n\nThese visual design elements create a striking contrast between the two monsters, emphasizing their different natures and origins while setting up a dramatic confrontation in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, both monsters have a menacing appearance, with a combination of rough texture and bold colors. They are closely facing each other, emphasizing the visual impact of their respective features. The first monster, located on the left, has a large, spiky, and clawed body structure, with a dark, almost gray-blue hue. On the other hand, the second monster is more towards the right and has a noticeably different appearance. This monster has a more prominent spiky head and is colored a mix of dark gray, black, and a few orange or red tones, giving it a more intimidating appearance. Although the two monsters have different body structures and colors, their overall visual design elements contribute to the action and intensity of the scene, making it an exciting and eye-catching image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare textures of Godzilla and King Kong.\n2. Describe and contrast the coloration of both monsters.\n3. Compare the body structures, focusing on distinguishing features.",
