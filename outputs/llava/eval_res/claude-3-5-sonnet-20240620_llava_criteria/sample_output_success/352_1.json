    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo has been edited and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the photo has been edited to appear as though there are two cute little faux foxes playing on the side of the brick walkway. In reality, there is only one fox figure located in the grass near the wall. The second fox figure is an altered photo with the face of the fox added later to create the illusion of two foxes playing. This playful and creative editing gives the scene a whimsical and charming appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, this photo has been edited. The main evidence for this is the presence of a cartoon-style squirrel on the grass near the sidewalk. This squirrel appears to have been digitally added to the image for the following reasons:\n\n1. Style mismatch: The squirrel has a cartoonish, illustrated appearance that doesn't match the photorealistic style of the rest of the image.\n\n2. Lighting inconsistency: The squirrel's bright orange color and sharp edges don't reflect the natural lighting conditions of the scene.\n\n3. Lack of integration: There are no shadows or reflections from the squirrel on the surrounding grass, which would be expected in a real photograph.\n\n4. Unusual placement: The squirrel's position on the grass near a busy street is somewhat unnatural and staged-looking.\n\n5. Perfect clarity: The squirrel image is crisp and clear, without any of the slight blur or grain that affects the rest of the photo.\n\nThe rest of the image appears to be an unedited photograph of an urban street scene, with natural elements like trees, grass, and a paved sidewalk alongside a road. The addition of the cartoon squirrel is likely a playful edit, perhaps to add interest or humor to the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the photo is edited by identifying the added squirrel.\n2. Evaluate the explanation of how the squirrel's integration indicates editing.\n3. Assess the consistency of lighting and shadows related to the squirrel.",
