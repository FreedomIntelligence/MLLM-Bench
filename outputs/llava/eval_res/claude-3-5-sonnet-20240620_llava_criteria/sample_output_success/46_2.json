    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat are the dishes in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a single dish that appears to be a spring roll or a similar wrapped appetizer. It's a cylindrical roll wrapped in what looks like a thin, translucent rice paper or cabbage leaf. The roll is placed on a white plate and is covered with a brown sauce or glaze. On top of the roll, there's a sprinkle of what seems to be chopped peanuts or another type of crushed nut. The sauce also pools around the roll on the plate. This dish is likely an Asian-inspired appetizer or main course, possibly a fresh spring roll or a similar wrapped dish served with a savory sauce.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe dishes in the image are a spring roll with sauce and a piece of bread covered in sauce or gravy, sitting on plates.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the dish as Fresh Lumpia (Lumpiang Sariwa) based on its visual characteristics.\n2. Include observations of distinct features such as wrapper, filling, and sauce.",
