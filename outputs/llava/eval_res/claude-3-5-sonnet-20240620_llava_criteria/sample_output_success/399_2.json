    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows two screenshots of the same game with different version. The bottom one is the later version of the game. Based on the renewal of the game shown in the image, analyze the possible aspects the next version of game will focus on.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the evolution shown in these two screenshots from different Grand Theft Auto games, we can analyze potential focus areas for the next version:\n\n1. Graphics and Realism: The most obvious improvement is in visual fidelity. The next version will likely push this even further, with more photorealistic characters, environments, and lighting effects.\n\n2. Character Detail: There's a significant increase in character detail, including facial features, hair, and clothing textures. Future versions may focus on even more lifelike character models with improved animations and expressions.\n\n3. Environmental Complexity: The background in the newer version shows more detail and depth. The next game might feature even more interactive and dynamic environments.\n\n4. Customization: The characters in the newer version have more unique features and styles. Future games may offer more extensive character customization options.\n\n5. Narrative and Dialogue: While not directly visible, the improved character models suggest a focus on more nuanced storytelling. The next version may emphasize more complex narratives and dialogue systems.\n\n6. Cultural Representation: The evolution shows a move towards more diverse and culturally specific character designs. This trend may continue with even more authentic representations of various communities.\n\n7. Immersive Details: Things like jewelry, tattoos, and clothing styles are more prominent in the newer version. Future games might focus on even more minute details to enhance immersion.\n\n8. Physics and Interactions: Though not explicitly shown, improved graphics often come with improved physics. The next version might focus on more realistic character interactions and environmental physics.\n\n9. Expanded World: Each GTA game typically expands its playable area. The next version might feature an even larger, more diverse game world.\n\n10. Technology Integration: With advancements in gaming technology, the next version might incorporate features like ray tracing, more advanced AI, or even VR integration.\n\nThese potential focus areas would aim to create an even more immersive, realistic, and expansive gaming experience in line with the series' evolution.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image presenting two different versions of the same game, the later version likely focuses on advanced features and improved graphics. Some possible aspects that the next version of the game might consider include:\n\n1. Improved character models and animations: Enhanced visuals and realism for the game's characters to make the gameplay more immersive and engaging.\n2. Enhanced physics and collision detection: Advanced systems for in-game environments and interactions, such as better collision detection for vehicles, character movements, and objects.\n3. Updated multiplayer features: Enhanced support for online multiplayer, including new modes, additional features, and better matchmaking capabilities.\n4. Expanded storyline and missions: A more comprehensive narrative and a wider variety of missions and objectives to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience.\n5. Variety of environments and terrains: The inclusion of diverse landscapes, urban settings, and outdoor terrains, creating a more realistic and dynamic gaming world.\n6. Improved sound and music systems: High-quality audio for the game, including better voice acting, sound effects, and a richer soundtrack to enhance the overall experience.\n7. Additional customization options: More options for character customization, such as clothing, accessories, and more realistic facial features and hair.\n8. Enhanced AI and challenging enemies: Advanced AI systems for enemies to make them more challenging and responsive during gameplay, making the overall experience more engaging.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
