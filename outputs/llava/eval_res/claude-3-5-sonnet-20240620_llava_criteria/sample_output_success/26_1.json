    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the writing posture of the girl in the picture and make some suggestions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the photo appears to have her elbow resting on the desk while writing. While this posture may provide additional support and comfort, it is not ideal for maintaining a proper and healthy writing posture. For better posture, the girl should consider adopting one of the following suggestions:\n\n1. Hold the pen or pencil in both hands and use a firm grip to minimize strain on the wrist and fingers.\n2. Place the notebook or book on a flat surface, like a desk or a lap, allowing the writing surface to be easily accessible.\n3. Keep the elbows slightly bent and maintain a relaxed, neutral position while writing.\n4. Maintain a comfortable position for the wrists and avoid bending them excessively while writing.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the girl can improve her writing posture, reduce the risk of strain or discomfort, and maintain a healthy and efficient writing experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a young person writing at a desk. From what can be observed, there are a few aspects of the writing posture that could be improved:\n\n1. Neck position: The head is tilted downward quite significantly, which can lead to neck strain over time. Suggestion: Raise the writing surface or lower the chair to reduce neck flexion.\n\n2. Back posture: While not fully visible, it appears the back may be slightly hunched. Suggestion: Encourage sitting up straighter, with the back supported against a chair backrest if possible.\n\n3. Arm support: The forearms don't appear to be resting on the desk surface, which may lead to shoulder strain. Suggestion: Adjust the chair height so the elbows can rest comfortably on the desk while writing.\n\n4. Lighting: While the general area seems well-lit, ensure there's adequate task lighting to reduce eye strain and prevent leaning too close to the paper.\n\n5. Paper position: The notebook appears to be straight in front of the writer. Suggestion: Angle the paper slightly (about 20-30 degrees) for most right-handed writers to reduce wrist strain.\n\n6. Regular breaks: Encourage taking short breaks every 20-30 minutes to stretch and look at distant objects to reduce eye strain and muscle fatigue.\n\nImplementing these suggestions can help improve posture, reduce strain, and make writing more comfortable for extended periods.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the girl's posture is ergonomically correct for writing.\n2. Assess the angle of the girl's neck and back in relation to the desk.\n3. Suggest improvements for a healthier writing posture.",
