    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the series of actions in the image and predict the possible next action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of stick figure diagrams labeled T1 through T5, depicting a sequence of actions or movements:\n\nT1: The figure is on a platform, reaching or interacting with objects above.\nT2: The figure is lying down on the platform, still interacting with objects above.\nT3: The figure is sitting up, and the objects seem to be forming a structure.\nT4: The figure is lying down again, and the objects are moving off to the side.\nT5: The figure is sitting on the edge of the platform, and the objects are falling or moving downward.\n\nBased on this sequence, a possible next action (let's call it T6) could be:\n\nThe figure standing up on the platform, with the objects scattered on the ground below. This would complete the cycle of movement from the initial reaching, to interacting with the objects, to their descent, and finally the figure returning to an upright position.\n\nAlternatively, it could show the figure beginning to climb down from the platform to retrieve or interact with the fallen objects, initiating a new cycle of activity.\n\nThe sequence seems to depict a cause-and-effect relationship between the figure's movements and the behavior of the surrounding objects, possibly illustrating concepts of physics, motion, or problem-solving.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a series of actions, starting with a ball above each person or symbol. From this observation, it can be inferred that the possible next action might be the ball either falling or moving towards the person, symbol, or ball to initiate the next action of the sequence. The current actions in the image involve the interaction between the ball, persons, and symbols, suggesting that this scene might be a representation of a sports game, gymnastics, or a martial arts performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the sequence of actions leading up to the last depicted moment.\n2. Predict the next action based on the momentum and position of figures.\n3. Ensure prediction is plausible within the context of the image sequence.",
