    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, there are several possible circumstances that could lead to this situation:\n\n1. Slip and fall accident: The yellow caution sign suggests the floor might be wet or slippery, which could have caused the person to fall.\n\n2. Medical emergency: The individual may have suddenly fallen ill or lost consciousness, causing them to collapse.\n\n3. Overwork or exhaustion: If this is in an office or academic setting, the person might have been overwhelmed with work and collapsed from stress or fatigue.\n\n4. Staged situation: This could be a drill or demonstration for safety training purposes.\n\n5. Fainting spell: The person might have fainted due to various reasons such as low blood sugar, dehydration, or other medical conditions.\n\n6. Tripping hazard: Although not visible in the image, the person could have tripped over an unseen obstacle.\n\n7. Sudden dizziness: A bout of vertigo or dizziness could have caused the person to lose balance and fall.\n\n8. Practical joke or performance art: Though less likely in a professional setting, this could be a planned act.\n\nThe scattered papers around the person suggest they were carrying documents when the incident occurred, which adds context to the situation, possibly indicating it happened during work-related activities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
