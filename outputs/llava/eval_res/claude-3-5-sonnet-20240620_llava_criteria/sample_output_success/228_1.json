    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the natural relationship that the creature in the image shows.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe creature in the image is a crab, which exhibits a natural relationship with its surroundings as a marine animal. It can be seen standing on a large rock under the water in an oceanside setting, with its body covered in red markings, typical of the crab's distinctive appearance. This environment provides the crab with shelter, food, and protection from predators. The crab's location near the ocean also indicates its adaptation to aquatic habitats, demonstrating its ability to live and thrive in various marine environments.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a hermit crab, which demonstrates a natural symbiotic relationship called commensalism. In this relationship, the hermit crab benefits from using the abandoned shell of a marine snail as its protective home, while the shell itself (which came from a deceased snail) is neither helped nor harmed.\n\nHermit crabs are known for their habit of occupying empty shells of other mollusks. This behavior provides them with protection for their soft abdomens and allows them to retreat into the shell when threatened. As the crab grows, it will seek out larger shells to accommodate its increasing size.\n\nThis relationship is an excellent example of how different species in nature can be interconnected, with one species making use of the discarded structures of another for its own survival and protection. It's a fascinating demonstration of adaptation and resource utilization in the natural world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the creature as a hermit crab using a shell; reference commensalism.\n2. Answer must reflect understanding of natural relationships, not just identification.",
