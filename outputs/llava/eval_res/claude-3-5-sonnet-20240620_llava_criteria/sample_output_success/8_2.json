    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and describe its usage.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the image is a digital projector. It's a device used to display video, images, or computer output onto a large screen or surface.\n\nDigital projectors are commonly used in various settings such as:\n\n1. Classrooms and lecture halls for educational presentations\n2. Business meetings and conferences for sharing information with large groups\n3. Home theaters for watching movies or playing video games on a big screen\n4. Public spaces for digital signage or art installations\n\nThis particular projector appears to be ceiling-mounted, which is a common installation method in permanent setups. It has a large lens in the center for projecting the image, and ventilation grills on the sides to help cool the internal components. The projector also seems to have some control buttons or indicator lights on the front panel.\n\nThe usage of such a projector involves connecting it to a video source (like a computer, DVD player, or gaming console), adjusting the focus and keystone settings, and projecting the content onto a suitable screen or wall. This allows for large-scale viewing of content, making it ideal for group presentations or entertainment purposes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a large lens, possibly the eyepiece of a projector, mounted on a ceiling. The lens is situated next to a fan, suggesting that it is likely connected to a projector unit, which is used for displaying images or videos onto a screen or surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a projector.\n2. Describe the projector's usage, such as displaying images or videos.",
