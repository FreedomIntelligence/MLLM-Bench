    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide insights into how the data presented in the image could be indicative of the economic dynamics within the Islamic financial sector.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image provides several key insights into the economic dynamics of the Islamic financial sector in 2022:\n\n1. Market Size: The total financial value of the Islamic market in 2022 was 3.25 trillion USD, indicating a substantial economic footprint.\n\n2. Sukuk Importance: Sukuk (Islamic bonds) represented 24% of the market value, amounting to 0.794 trillion USD. This suggests that Sukuk is a significant financial instrument in Islamic finance.\n\n3. Regional Distribution: The MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region accounted for 31% of the total number of issues globally, while other regions represented 69%. This shows that while the MENA region is important, Islamic finance has a global reach.\n\n4. Issue Volume: There were 1404 issues globally in 2022, with a total value of 182,715 million USD, indicating active market participation and liquidity.\n\n5. Country-specific Issuances: Saudi Arabia was the largest issuer in the MENA region with 42,643 million USD, followed by Bahrain (7,218 million USD) and UAE (3,500 million USD). This highlights the dominance of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in Islamic finance.\n\n6. Diverse Participation: The presence of non-traditional Islamic finance countries like Egypt in the list of issuers suggests a growing adoption of Islamic financial instruments beyond core Islamic countries.\n\n7. Market Concentration: The fact that Saudi Arabia's issuances far outweigh those of other countries indicates a concentration of Islamic finance activities in the kingdom, possibly due to its economic size and policy initiatives.\n\n8. Growth Potential: The substantial size of \"Other\" financial instruments (76% of the market) suggests room for innovation and diversification in Islamic financial products beyond Sukuk.\n\nThese insights point to a growing, globally expanding Islamic finance sector with strong roots in the MENA region, particularly in GCC countries. The sector shows signs of diversification in both products and geographical reach, indicating potential for further growth and integration into the global financial system.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a bar graph showing the number of issues and financial value of the Islamic market in 2021. The Islamic market is growing rapidly, with the total number of issues being at 145 billion USD over the past year. This demonstrates the increasing interest in and demand for Islamic finance within the global financial sector. With countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and others making significant investments in this sector, it is evident that the Islamic market is becoming more prominent and influential in the global financial landscape. This implies that the Islamic financial sector is gaining acceptance and attracting more attention from investors, governments, and businesses, which will further contribute to its growth and development in the years to come.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify proportions of Sukuk and other financial instruments in Islamic market value.\n2. Compare MENA region issuances to other regions in 2022.\n3. Analyze country-specific data for economic insights within MENA.",
