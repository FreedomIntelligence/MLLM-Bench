    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the text in the image and the implicit message conveyed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe text in the image is a saying or a motivational quote, which reads \"Life is a Straight Road to Success.\" The message conveyed by this quote is that success is a direct and clear pathway, and that with determination and effort, one can achieve success in life. The red background and bold lettering emphasize the importance and positivity of the message.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe text in the image reads:\n\n\"LIFE IS A STRAIGHT ROAD TO SUCCESS\"\n\nThis message is presented in a visually striking manner, with black text on a bright red triangular background that resembles a road or path. The text is written in a rough, hand-drawn style.\n\nThe implicit message conveyed by this image is actually quite ironic and contradictory to the literal text. While the words suggest a straightforward path to success, the visual presentation and surrounding elements tell a different story:\n\n1. The text is not neatly written, but rather in a messy, chaotic style, implying that the road to success is not as straightforward as the words claim.\n\n2. The red triangle is surrounded by a busy, cluttered black background filled with smiley faces and abstract shapes, suggesting that life and the path to success are actually complex and filled with distractions or obstacles.\n\n3. The contrast between the bold statement and the chaotic presentation creates a sense of tension, hinting that success is not as simple or direct as one might hope.\n\nIn essence, the image seems to be making a statement about the complexity and unpredictability of life and success, despite the seemingly straightforward message of the text. It challenges the viewer to look beyond simple platitudes and consider the reality of life's journey.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately transcribe all text: \"Life is a straight road to success.\"\n2. Describe the image's implicit message or metaphor.",
