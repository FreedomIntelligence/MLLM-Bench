Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnswer the question marks in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of math problems with the numbers 1 through 12, and some of them are missing. The missing numbers are represented by question marks. To answer the question, find the mathematical expression corresponding to each missing number based on the context of the problem.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1) From the first two equations:\n   Circle + Triangle = 8\n   Circle - Triangle = 4\n   Adding these equations: 2 * Circle = 12\n   So, Circle = 6\n\n2) Substituting this back:\n   6 + Triangle = 8\n   So, Triangle = 2\n\n3) From the third equation:\n   Star + Square = 12\n\n4) From the fourth equation:\n   Star - Square = Square\n   This means Star = 2 * Square\n\n5) Substituting this into the third equation:\n   2 * Square + Square = 12\n   3 * Square = 12\n   Square = 4\n\n6) And consequently, Star = 2 * 4 = 8\n\n7) We can verify this with the last equation:\n   Square + Square = Star\n   4 + 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, the answers to the question marks are:\nStar = 8\nCircle = 6\nSquare = 4\nTriangle = 2\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the value of the star based on the given equations and reference.\n2. Accurately calculates the values of circle, square, and triangle using visual math reasoning.\n3. Answers are consistent with reference: star = 8, circle = 6, square = 4, triangle = 2.",
