    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the image and identify visual cues that suggest the nutritional differences between each hamburger.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows four different types of sandwiches or burgers, each with distinct visual cues suggesting different nutritional profiles:\n\n1. Top Left (Beef Burger):\n   - Large beef patty suggests high protein and fat content\n   - Bacon adds additional fat and calories\n   - Cheese slice adds fat and calcium\n   - Some vegetables (lettuce, onion) provide minimal fiber and nutrients\n\n2. Top Right (Fried Chicken Burger):\n   - Breaded, fried chicken patty indicates high fat and calorie content from frying\n   - More visible greens suggest higher fiber and nutrient content\n   - White sauce likely adds fat and calories\n\n3. Bottom Left (Submarine Sandwich):\n   - Leaner appearance with sliced meats (likely lower fat than burger patties)\n   - Abundance of vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers) indicates higher fiber, vitamin, and mineral content\n   - Longer bread suggests higher carbohydrate content\n\n4. Bottom Right (Double Beef Burger):\n   - Two beef patties indicate very high protein and fat content\n   - Cheese adds additional fat and calcium\n   - Sesame seed bun may offer slight nutritional benefits over plain bun\n   - Less visible vegetables suggest lower fiber and nutrient content compared to others\n\nIn general, the submarine sandwich appears to be the most balanced option with lean proteins and a variety of vegetables. The double beef burger likely has the highest calorie and fat content, while the fried chicken burger would be high in calories due to the frying process. The single beef burger falls somewhere in between in terms of overall nutritional balance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image consists of four different hamburgers, each having distinct ingredients and toppings. The visual cues that indicate the nutritional differences among these hamburgers include the choice of meat, the variety of toppings, and the type of cheese used. \n\nIt can be observed that one of the hamburgers contains only meat and lettuce, making it a leaner option compared to the other hamburgers that have additional toppings like tomatoes, onions, and cheese. The variations in toppings and ingredients suggest that these hamburgers provide different nutritional profiles, depending on personal preferences and dietary needs.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify ingredients in each hamburger that affect nutritional content, such as meat type and toppings.\n2. Compare visual size and thickness of patties and buns among the hamburgers.\n3. Note presence of additional elements like sauces or cheese that imply caloric differences.",
