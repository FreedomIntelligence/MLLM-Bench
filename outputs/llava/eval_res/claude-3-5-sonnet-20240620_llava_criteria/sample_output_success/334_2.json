    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the image, I can see a badminton racquet with damage to the frame. The damage appears to be at the top of the racquet head, where the frame has split or cracked. This type of damage is quite severe and unfortunately, it's not typically repairable in a way that would make the racquet safe or effective for play again.\n\nFor this level of damage, here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Replace the racquet: Given the extent of the damage, the safest and most practical solution is to replace the racquet entirely. Playing with a damaged frame can be dangerous and will significantly affect performance.\n\n2. If sentimental value is involved: If the racquet has sentimental value, you might consider having it professionally restored for display purposes only, not for play.\n\n3. Recycling: If replacement is the chosen option, look into recycling programs for sports equipment. Many places accept old racquets for recycling or repurposing.\n\n4. Learn from the damage: Consider what might have caused this damage (e.g., impact, overuse, improper storage) to prevent similar issues with future racquets.\n\n5. Temporary fix (not recommended for play): If you absolutely must use it one last time, you could try a temporary fix with strong epoxy and tape, but this is not safe for regular play and should only be a last resort.\n\nRemember, playing with a damaged racquet can be dangerous and will likely result in poor performance. It's always best to use equipment that's in good condition for safety and optimal play.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
