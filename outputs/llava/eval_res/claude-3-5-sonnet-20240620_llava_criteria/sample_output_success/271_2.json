    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIn a setting where a group gathers to witness a signing event, what might be the underlying social connections that bring them together for this occasion?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn a setting like this, where a large group has gathered to witness a signing event, there are likely several layers of social connections bringing them together:\n\n1. Political affiliations: Given the formal, ornate setting and the presence of what appears to be high-ranking officials, many of these individuals are likely connected through political party membership, governmental roles, or shared policy interests.\n\n2. Professional relationships: There may be staff members, advisors, and colleagues who work closely together in various capacities within the government or related organizations.\n\n3. Family ties: The presence of children and individuals of various ages suggests that family members of key figures are present, indicating personal connections beyond just professional ones.\n\n4. Institutional connections: Representatives from different branches of government or various departments may be present, connected by their roles in the broader governmental structure.\n\n5. Shared interests or stakes in the signing: Those gathered likely have a vested interest in whatever is being signed, whether it's legislation, an executive order, or another significant document.\n\n6. Media relationships: There may be members of the press present to document the event, connected by their professional duty to report on such occasions.\n\n7. Historical or long-standing associations: Some individuals may have long histories of working together on various initiatives or campaigns, creating deep-rooted connections.\n\n8. Mentorship or legacy connections: Older and younger individuals present might represent different generations of political or public service legacies.\n\nThe formal attire, the mix of ages, and the clear focus on the central signing action all point to an event of significant importance, likely bringing together a complex web of professional, personal, and political relationships centered around the act being commemorated.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe group gathered around the president as he signs a document may have strong connections or represent various interests that are affected by the decision being made. These connections can include social, professional, or institutional ties, such as political affiliations, business partnerships, or memberships in specific organizations. In the context of the image, the people watching the signing might be part of the administration, members of the public, or representatives of industries or organizations that will be directly impacted by the decision made by the president. The gathering could also be an opportunity for networking and building relationships, as well as learning about and discussing the decision directly with the person making it.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional roles and political affiliations of individuals.\n2. Suggest family relationships or personal connections among attendees.",
