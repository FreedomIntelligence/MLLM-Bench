    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows three individuals in traditional Mongolian or Central Asian attire, positioned in what appears to be a formal or ceremonial setting. \n\nThe central figure, seated behind an ornate wooden desk, displays a broad, warm smile. Their expression suggests a sense of pride, joy, or satisfaction. Their posture, seated centrally and slightly elevated, implies a position of authority or importance within the context.\n\nThe two standing figures flanking the central person have more neutral expressions, with slight smiles. Their posture is upright and formal, suggesting a supportive or ceremonial role. They appear attentive and respectful towards the central figure.\n\nAll three individuals are dressed in elaborate, colorful traditional costumes, which adds to the formal and cultural significance of the scene. The central figure's costume is particularly ornate, further emphasizing their important role.\n\nThe overall body language and positioning of the three suggest a hierarchical structure, with the seated person likely in a leadership or honored guest position, and the standing individuals in supporting or attendant roles.\n\nThe setting, with its symbolic decorations like the large golden moon-like shape above and the carved desk, reinforces the ceremonial or culturally significant nature of the event or moment being captured.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
