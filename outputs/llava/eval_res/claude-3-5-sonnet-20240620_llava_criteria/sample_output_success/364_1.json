Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCreate a free verse on the energy of a protest, the collective voice for change, and democracy's spirit at a capitol.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nA gathering on a grassy field,\nA city's skyline as their backdrop,\nThousands of voices in unison,\nA peaceful protest in action.\n\nIn front of a grand, historic building,\nA crowd of people with a shared goal,\nTo speak for those unheard,\nTo demand change and break the mold.\n\nThe energy of the protest,\nA force that cannot be ignored,\nUnited, they stand and shout,\nFor a brighter future and clean power.\n\nA collective voice for change,\nA testament to democracy's strength,\nWith every protester in the crowd,\nThe spirit of progress and unity grows.\n\nTogether, they make their stand,\nFor a better world and fair play,\nFighting for the rights of all,\nIn this public display.\n\nA wave of hope and determination,\nThe future they envision for their nation,\nWith every person in the field,\nA collective force that cannot yield.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nVoices rise like steam from heated streets,\nA sea of souls before the gilded dome,\nWhere power sleeps in marble and concrete.\n\nSigns held high, a forest of discontent,\nWords sharp as thorns, bold as summer bloom,\nDemocracy's roots, once dormant, now fervent.\n\nThe air thick with chants and righteous fury,\nA thunderstorm of change on the horizon,\nEach voice a raindrop in this human flurry.\n\nBeneath the watchful eyes of history,\nThey stand united, a living petition,\nDemanding justice, equality, to be free.\n\nThe capitol's steps, a stage for the unheard,\nWhere whispers become shouts, and shouts, a roar,\nThe people's will can no longer be deferred.\n\nIn this crucible of civic unrest,\nThe spirit of change ignites and soars,\nA reminder that power, at its best,\nFlows not from above, but from the people's core.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Incorporate the capitol's image, protest energy, and crowd's collective voice for change.\n2. Reflect the spirit of democracy and the context of a public demonstration.\n3.
