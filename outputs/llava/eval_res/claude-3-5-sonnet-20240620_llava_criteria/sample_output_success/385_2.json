    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the next move of the animal in this wintry habitat and describe the objective of this action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe next move of the fox in this wintry habitat will likely be a pounce downward onto the snow-covered ground. The objective of this action is hunting.\n\nThe image shows a red fox in mid-leap, with its body fully extended and airborne above a snowy field dotted with dry grass stalks. This distinctive leap, with the fox's front paws tucked close to its body and its head pointed downward, is a classic hunting technique known as \"mousing.\"\n\nFoxes use this method to catch small prey like mice, voles, or other rodents that may be moving beneath the snow. The fox likely heard or sensed movement under the snow layer and jumped high to gain momentum for a powerful, precise landing.\n\nUpon landing, the fox will use its sharp hearing and sense of smell to pinpoint its prey's exact location, then quickly dig through the snow with its paws to catch the animal. This hunting technique is crucial for the fox's survival in winter when food sources are scarce.\n\nThe fox's next move – the downward pounce and potential digging – is aimed at securing a meal in this challenging winter environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a fox is captured mid-air, jumping high into the air over a snowy field with tall grass. This motion suggests that the fox is either hunting or attempting to catch prey. The objective of this action is to ensure the survival of the fox in a competitive environment by obtaining food. Foxes are opportunistic predators and rely on their agility, keen senses, and stealth to catch their prey, typically small mammals or birds. By performing this jump, the fox is showcasing its ability to adapt and hunt in adverse weather conditions and challenging environments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the fox's next likely action related to hunting in the snow.\n2. Describe the purpose of the predicted action in relation to hunting.\n3. Ensure the response is consistent with the wintry habitat context.",
