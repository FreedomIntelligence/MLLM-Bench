    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe architectural style depicted in this image is characteristic of a Neoclassical or Beaux-Arts design, which was popular for grand public buildings and museums in the 18th and 19th centuries. This is evident from the following features:\n\n1. High ceilings with ornate moldings and cornices\n2. A large skylight running the length of the room, allowing natural light to illuminate the space\n3. Symmetrical layout and proportions\n4. Elegant, polished wooden flooring in a herringbone pattern\n5. Rich, warm-colored walls (in this case, a reddish-brown tone) typical of traditional gallery spaces\n\nAs for the cultural function, this is clearly an art museum or gallery. This can be determined by:\n\n1. Large-scale paintings hung on the walls, many of which appear to be historical or classical in subject matter\n2. The presence of visitors walking through the space, observing the artworks\n3. Protective barriers (likely ropes or railings) in front of the paintings to keep viewers at a safe distance\n4. Benches in the center of the room for visitors to rest and contemplate the art\n5. The overall grand and formal atmosphere designed to showcase important cultural artifacts\n\nThis space is designed for the public display and appreciation of fine art, serving an important cultural and educational function in society. It allows people to engage with historical and artistic works in a carefully curated environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style elements like wall decor, ceiling, and lighting.\n2. Determine cultural function based on room contents and visitor activity.",
