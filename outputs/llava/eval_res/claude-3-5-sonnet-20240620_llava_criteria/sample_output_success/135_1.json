    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the activity taking place and briefly introduce the game rule.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a group of people, including both children and adults, are playing a game together. They are holding hands and are in a circle while one person stands in the center, possibly trying to break the circle. The name of the game is \"Hot Potato\" or an Indian version of it. The objective of the game is for the person standing in the center to pass the ball or potato to another person without letting it touch the ground, essentially becoming the \"hot\" potato. This game is played for fun, as it tests the players' reflexes, agility, and social camaraderie.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a group of children playing a game that appears to be \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" or a similar circle game. In this activity, several children are sitting in a circle while one child stands and walks around the outside, tapping or touching the heads of the seated children.\n\nThe basic rule of \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" is that the standing child taps each seated child's head, saying \"duck\" until they choose one child to be the \"goose.\" When they do this, the chosen child must get up and chase the tapper around the circle. If the tapper makes it back to the empty spot without being caught, they sit down and the chaser becomes the new tapper. If caught, the original tapper must go again.\n\nThis type of game encourages physical activity, quick reflexes, and social interaction among children. It's a popular choice for group play in schools, parks, or other recreational settings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity depicted and determine if it aligns with a known children's game.\n2. Explain the basic rule(s) of the game based on the visual cues in the image.",
