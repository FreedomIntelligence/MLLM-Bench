Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nYou are a software developer. You have the attached image and you need to code an UI or app with the same characteristics, color, shapes, etc. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, you need to create a calculator interface that resembles the design shown. Here's a possible implementation using a popular JavaScript library, React Native, to create the calculator app:\n\n1. Install React Native by running `npm install --save react-native` or `yarn add react-native` in your project directory.\n2. Create a new React Native project using `npx react-native init MyCalculatorApp` or `yarn create react-native-app MyCalculatorApp`.\n3. Add the calculator's UI components, such as buttons, to the app. You can either use built-in components like `Button` or import and use custom UI elements from a library.\n4. Implement the calculator's functionalities by writing the math operations in JavaScript. This can be done inside the component or in a separate module.\n5. Style the calculator interface with custom colors, shapes, and layout to match the image. You can use the `StyleSheet` component provided by React Native to define styles and apply them to the calculator's UI components.\n6. Implement the button labels and input components to enable users to input numbers and perform math operations.\n7. Test the calculator app on different devices to ensure it works as expected.\n\nHere is a sample code that creates a basic calculator interface:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native';\n\nconst Calculator = () => {\n  const [input, setInput] = useState('');\n  const [display, setDisplay] = useState('');\n  const [operator, setOperator] = useState('+');\n  const [number1, setNumber1] = useState('');\n  const [number2, setNumber2] = useState('');\n\n  const handleNumberPress = (value) => {\n    setInput(value);\n    setNumber1(value);\n  };\n\n  const handleOperatorPress = () => {\n    setInput(operator);\n  };\n\n  const handleEqualPress = () => {\n    if (operator === '+' || operator === '-') {\n      const result = parseInt(number1) + parseInt(input);\n      setDisplay(result);\n      setNumber2(result);\n      setOperator('');\n      setInput('');\n    } else if (operator === '*') {\n      const result = parseInt(number1) * parseInt(input);\n      setDisplay(result);\n      setNumber2(result);\n      setOperator('');\n      setInput('');\n    } else if (operator === '/') {\n      const result = parseInt(number2) / parseInt(input);\n      setDisplay(result);\n      setNumber1(parseInt(result));\n      setOperator('');\n      setInput('');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: 20, paddingHorizontal: 20 }}>\n      <TextInput\n        style={{ marginBottom: 10, borderWidth: 1, borderColor: 'gray' }}\n        value={input}\n        onChangeText={setInput}\n      />\n      <View>\n        <Button title=\"C\" onPress={() => handleNumberPress('0')} />\n        <Button title=\"Clear\" onPress={() => setInput('')} />\n        <\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs a software developer, to create a UI or app with the same characteristics as the image provided, I would focus on the following key aspects:\n\n1. Color Scheme:\n   - Background: Black\n   - Main button colors: Dark gray for most buttons\n   - Accent color: Orange for operation buttons on the right\n   - Text color: White for all buttons\n\n2. Layout:\n   - Grid layout with 5 rows and 10 columns\n   - Buttons are pill-shaped (rounded rectangles)\n   - Most buttons are equal in size, with some exceptions:\n     - The \"0\" button spans two columns\n     - The operation buttons on the right are slightly larger\n\n3. Typography:\n   - Use a sans-serif font for all text\n   - Varying text sizes, with larger text for numbers and basic operations\n\n4. Features:\n   - Scientific calculator functionality\n   - Display area at the top (showing \"750\" in the image)\n\n5. Button Types:\n   - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)\n   - Numbers 0-9 and decimal point\n   - Advanced mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.)\n   - Memory functions (mc, m+, m-, mr)\n   - Constants (e, π)\n   - Other functions (%, ±, EE, Rand)\n\nTo implement this UI, I would recommend using a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter for mobile development, or a web framework like React or Vue.js for web applications. This would allow for easy implementation of the grid layout and consistent styling across different devices.\n\nFor the functionality, I would implement a calculator logic that can handle both basic and scientific operations, ensuring that the UI is not only visually appealing but also fully functional as a scientific calculator.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify all UI elements: buttons, symbols, and layout.\n2. Match color scheme and button shapes exactly as in the image.\n3. Ensure functional similarity in coded UI to the image's calculator app.",
