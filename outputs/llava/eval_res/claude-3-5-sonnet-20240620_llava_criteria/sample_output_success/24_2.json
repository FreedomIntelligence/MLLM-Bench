    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the swimming stroke being used by examining the position of the swimmer's hands and head.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the position of the swimmer's arms and head in the image, the swimming stroke being used is the butterfly stroke. \n\nThe key indicators are:\n\n1. The arms are extended outward to the sides in a symmetrical position, forming a \"Y\" shape with the body. This is characteristic of the butterfly stroke's recovery phase.\n\n2. The swimmer's head is raised above the water surface, with the mouth open, likely taking a breath. This head position is typical in butterfly swimming when the swimmer comes up for air.\n\n3. There's a significant splash of water around the swimmer's upper body, which is common in butterfly due to the powerful arm movements and body undulation.\n\n4. The swimmer is wearing goggles and a swim cap, which are standard for competitive swimming where butterfly is one of the four main strokes.\n\nThe butterfly stroke is known for its simultaneous arm movements and dolphin kick, making it one of the most physically demanding swimming strokes. This image captures a moment in the stroke cycle where the swimmer is at the peak of their arm recovery and breath.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the swimmer is in the process of taking a stroke while swimming in the water. He is wearing glasses and a white cap. His left arm is extended, and his head is positioned to the side, which suggests that he is using a breaststroke technique to swim. The breaststroke is a swimming stroke where swimmers use their arms and chest muscles to propel themselves through the water in a pattern resembling a breaststroke motion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the swimmer's hands move simultaneously with wingspan-like motion (butterfly stroke).\n2. Confirm the swimmer's head position aligns with butterfly stroke technique (facing down).\n3. Evaluate the synchronicity of hand and head movement indicative of butterfly stroke.",
