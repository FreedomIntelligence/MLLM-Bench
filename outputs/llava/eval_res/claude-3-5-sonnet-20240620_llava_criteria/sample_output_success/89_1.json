    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the decoration style in the image, what items in the picture reflect this style?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe decoration style in the image appears to be modern and contemporary. This is reflected in the use of white and brown tones, as well as the clean and sleek design. The bedroom features a white bed, a wall adorned with modern art, and brown wooden headboard, which contribute to the overall contemporary atmosphere. Additionally, the presence of a wall sconce provides a touch of modern elegance. Overall, these elements work together to create an inviting and stylish bedroom environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe decoration style in this image can be identified as modern or contemporary with a touch of minimalist and organic elements. Several items in the picture reflect this style:\n\n1. The dark wood slat wall: The vertical wooden slats create a sleek, textured backdrop that adds warmth and sophistication to the space.\n\n2. Circular wall art: The gold-toned circular wall decorations with leaf motifs add an organic, nature-inspired element to the modern design.\n\n3. Pendant light: The simple, spherical pendant light with a gold-toned frame exemplifies minimalist design.\n\n4. White perforated panel: The lower half of the wall features a white panel with perforated dots, adding a modern, geometric element to the design.\n\n5. Neutral color palette: The use of browns, whites, and gold tones creates a harmonious and contemporary look.\n\n6. Clean-lined bedding: The simple, white bedding with minimal texture adheres to the modern aesthetic.\n\n7. Sculptural decor: The small black sculptural piece on the side table (possibly a whale tail) adds an artistic touch to the space.\n\nThese elements combine to create a sophisticated, contemporary bedroom design that balances warmth and minimalism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the decoration style accurately (e.g., modern, minimalist).\n2. List specific items that reflect the identified style (e.g., wall art, lighting).\n3.
