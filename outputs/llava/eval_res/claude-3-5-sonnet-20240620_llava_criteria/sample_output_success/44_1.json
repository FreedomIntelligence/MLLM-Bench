    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the red berry in the smoothie bowl in the image? How is it different from the dark purple berry in the bowl? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe red berry in the smoothie bowl is the strawberry, whereas the dark purple berry is the acai berry. Both of these berries are included in the smoothie alongside other fruits, such as blueberries, blackberries, and bananas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe red berry in the smoothie bowl is a raspberry. Raspberries are distinctively red, have a hollow center, and are made up of many small individual sections called drupelets, which give them their characteristic bumpy texture.\n\nThe dark purple berry in the bowl is a blackberry. Blackberries differ from raspberries in several ways:\n\n1. Color: Blackberries are dark purple to almost black, while raspberries are red.\n\n2. Shape: Blackberries are more elongated and oval-shaped compared to the rounder raspberries.\n\n3. Texture: While both have a bumpy surface, blackberries tend to have larger individual drupelets.\n\n4. Taste: Blackberries are generally sweeter and less tart than raspberries.\n\n5. Core: When picked, blackberries retain their white core, while raspberries are hollow.\n\nBoth berries are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, making them excellent additions to a healthy diet. In the image, you can see both types of berries in the smoothie bowl, along with other fruits like mango, strawberries, and blueberries, creating a colorful and nutritious meal.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the raspberry and describe its color, shape, and texture\n2. Identify the dark purple berry as blackberry.\n3. Include at least one distinctive feature that differentiates the raspberry from the dark purple berry.",
