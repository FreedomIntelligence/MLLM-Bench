    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine their potential function.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a collection of glass dabbers, which are tools commonly used in the glass art and lampworking community. These objects have several potential functions:\n\n1. Glass manipulation: Dabbers are used to shape, mold, and manipulate hot glass during the glassblowing or lampworking process.\n\n2. Applying color: They can be used to add colors or patterns to glass pieces by touching the hot glass with the colored end of the dabber.\n\n3. Creating texture: The various shapes and sizes of the dabber ends can be used to create different textures on glass surfaces.\n\n4. Marbling: Dabbers can be used to swirl colors together, creating marbled effects in glass.\n\n5. Decorative display: When not in use, these colorful and uniquely shaped tools can serve as a decorative element in an artist's studio.\n\nThe dabbers in the image come in various colors including blue, green, red, yellow, and black. They have different shapes at their ends, some appearing more rounded while others are more angular or faceted. The collection is arranged in a circular pattern, likely stored in a container or stand, with the colorful ends facing upward. The background appears to be a wooden surface, suggesting this might be on a workbench or table in a glass artist's workspace.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a group of seven pens placed inside a clear cup. These pens come in various colors, making them a visually pleasing assortment. The collection of pens in the cup might be a part of a creative workspace, meant for individuals who need to write, draw, or take notes frequently. Such colorful pens can also be used for decorative purposes, adding a touch of color and fun to the environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify objects as screwdrivers.\n2. Describe the potential function of screwdrivers (tightening/loosening screws).\n3. Mention the presence of multiple screwdrivers, noting variety if visible.",
