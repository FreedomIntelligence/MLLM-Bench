    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nTaking into consideration the material of the shoes, which pair of shoes in the picture is best suited for long-distance running?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image provided, it's difficult to identify a pair of shoes specifically designed for long-distance running. The shoe rack contains a variety of footwear types, including dress shoes, boots, casual shoes, and some athletic-looking shoes, but there isn't a clear pair of running shoes visible.\n\nFor long-distance running, you would typically look for shoes with good cushioning, support, and breathable materials. These would usually be specialized running shoes, which are not prominently featured in this closet.\n\nThe closest options that might be suitable for some form of athletic activity appear to be a few pairs of sneakers or athletic shoes visible on some of the shelves. However, without being able to see them up close or know their specific design features, it's impossible to determine if any of these would be ideal for long-distance running.\n\nFor the best shoe for long-distance running, you would typically want to look for a dedicated running shoe from a sports or athletic footwear brand, which doesn't seem to be present in this particular shoe collection.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are several pairs of shoes stored on shelves in a room. A suitable pair of shoes for long-distance running would be a pair of running shoes, which can be identified by their lightweight, breathable, and cushioned design. The image does not provide enough information to determine the material of the shoes. However, it is likely that the shoes are made from materials like synthetic and mesh for the upper part and a cushioned, supportive, and durable sole with good traction for long-distance running. To find the best pair, it would be necessary to search specifically for running shoes among the stored shoes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify shoes that appear designed for running based on material and structure.\n2. Assess suitability for long-distance running, considering material durability and comfort.\n3. Exclude shoes clearly unsuitable for running (e.g., high heels, boots).",
