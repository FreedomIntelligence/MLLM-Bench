    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows two main objects:\n\n1. An AV Access device (likely a media streaming or conversion box)\n2. An iPad (partially visible beneath the AV Access device)\n\nThe AV Access device has several sockets and ports, which I'll identify and describe their functionality:\n\n1. Two USB ports: These are likely USB-A ports for connecting peripherals, storage devices, or other USB-compatible devices.\n\n2. One USB-C port: This could be used for faster data transfer, video output, or power delivery.\n\n3. 3.5mm audio jack: For connecting headphones or external speakers.\n\n4. SD card slot: For reading SD memory cards, often used in cameras and other devices.\n\n5. Power button: A circular button on the right side, likely for turning the device on and off.\n\n6. LED indicators: Small lights above the ports, probably indicating power and various connection statuses.\n\nThe device also has some icons above the LED indicators, which seem to represent different output modes or connection types, but their exact functionality isn't clear from the image alone.\n\nThe iPad beneath the AV Access device isn't fully visible, but it appears to be acting as a base or potentially interacting with the AV Access device in some way.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
