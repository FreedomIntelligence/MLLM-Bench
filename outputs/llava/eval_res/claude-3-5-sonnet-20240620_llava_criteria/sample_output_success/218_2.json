    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the radar chart, what does Libertarianism feature?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAccording to the radar chart, Libertarianism (represented by the red line) features strongly in three main areas:\n\n1. Individualism: The red line extends to nearly the outermost ring in this category, indicating a very high emphasis on individualism.\n\n2. Liberty: The chart shows Libertarianism reaching almost to the outer edge in the Liberty category, suggesting a strong focus on personal freedom.\n\n3. Skepticism of Authority: The red line extends far in this direction, implying that Libertarianism is characterized by a significant distrust or questioning of authority.\n\nAdditionally, Libertarianism shows moderate levels of support for the Scientific Method and Secularism, as indicated by the red line's position in these areas. It appears to have less emphasis on Progress, Equality, and Reason compared to the other aspects mentioned.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe radar chart shows that Libertarianism features a strong emphasis on individualism, freedom, and minimal government intervention. It is located near the center of the chart, surrounded by various other ideologies, such as Postmodernism, Marxism, and Feminism. The radar chart indicates that while there is some overlap between these ideologies, Libertarianism stands out due to its primary focus on individual freedom and limited government involvement. This emphasis distinguishes it from other ideologies, which may prioritize collective rights, social equality, or broader governmental intervention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Libertarianism's highest score as Liberty.\n2. Identify Libertarianism's lowest score as either Equality or Progress, since these two aspects have approximately the same scores that cannot be differentiated.\n",
