    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality is good and clear. It shows a close-up of a hand holding an old-style Nokia mobile phone. The phone's screen displays the classic Snake game, which is pixelated and blue on a dark background. The phone itself appears to be a light color, possibly white or pale gray.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there's text that reads \"Love Playing Snake?\" in a clean, modern font. The background behind the hand and phone is blurred but appears to be a neutral, possibly outdoor setting.\n\nThe composition of the image is effective, focusing the viewer's attention on the nostalgic game and the question about loving to play Snake. The contrast between the modern text overlay and the vintage phone creates an interesting visual dynamic. Overall, it's a well-executed image that likely aims to evoke nostalgia for early mobile gaming.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3. Assess the visibility and legibility of the text \"Love Playing Snake?\".",
