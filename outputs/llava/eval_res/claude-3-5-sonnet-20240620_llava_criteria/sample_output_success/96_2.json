    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis artwork represents the Cubist movement, specifically a later phase of Cubism often referred to as Synthetic Cubism.\n\nKey stylistic features that help identify this as a Cubist work, and potentially point to a specific artist or school, include:\n\n1. Fragmented and geometric forms: The figure is composed of various geometric shapes and angular lines, breaking down the natural form into abstract elements.\n\n2. Flattened perspective: The image lacks traditional depth and perspective, presenting a more two-dimensional view of the subject.\n\n3. Bold, vibrant colors: The use of bright, contrasting colors is characteristic of later Cubist works.\n\n4. Simplified and distorted facial features: The face is depicted with exaggerated and asymmetrical features, typical of Cubist portraiture.\n\n5. Multiple viewpoints: Different angles of the face seem to be presented simultaneously, a hallmark of Cubist technique.\n\n6. Thick, visible brushstrokes: The painting technique emphasizes the materiality of the paint and the artist's hand.\n\n7. Incorporation of text: The presence of text (\"IS AWOOOOMC\") in the upper left corner is a common feature in some Cubist works.\n\n8. Framing effect: The composition is framed by bold colors, creating a picture-within-a-picture effect.\n\nThese features, particularly the bold colors, simplified forms, and the specific style of facial distortion, are reminiscent of the later works of Pablo Picasso, one of the pioneers of Cubism. The painting exhibits a playful, almost childlike quality in its execution, which is also characteristic of Picasso's style in his post-World War II period.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
