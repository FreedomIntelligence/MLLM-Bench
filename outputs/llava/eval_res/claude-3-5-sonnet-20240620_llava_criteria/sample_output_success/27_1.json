    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat are people in the image doing?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the image are practicing dance moves, possibly yoga or another form of exercise, in a room.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two people engaged in what appears to be a gentle exercise or stretching activity. In the foreground, there's a person wearing a light blue polo shirt, with their arms raised and outstretched. They seem to be performing a stretching or tai chi-like movement. In the background, another person in a pink top can be seen with their arms also raised, suggesting they are doing the same activity.\n\nThe setting looks bright and airy, possibly in a fitness studio or community center, with natural light coming in through windows. The activity they're doing seems calm and controlled, likely focused on flexibility, balance, or mindfulness. This type of exercise is often popular among older adults for maintaining mobility and overall health.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the answer includes \"practice tai chi\" as the action being performed.\n2. Check for mention of multiple people engaging in the activity.",
