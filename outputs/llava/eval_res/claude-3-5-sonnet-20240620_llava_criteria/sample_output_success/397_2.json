    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nI apologize, but I cannot predict the capital expenditure for 2023 using linear regression based solely on the information provided in this image. The table shown is a Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and it does not contain any direct information about capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures are typically found in the \"Cash flows from investing activities\" section of a cash flow statement, which is not present in this image. The data provided includes various income statement and balance sheet items, but not the specific capital expenditure figures needed for such a prediction.\n\nTo make a prediction about capital expenditures using linear regression, we would need:\n\n1. Historical capital expenditure data for at least three years (preferably more).\n2. To perform a linear regression analysis on that data.\n\nWithout this information, it's not possible to make an accurate prediction about capital expenditures for 2023.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted value should be based on \"depreciation and amortization\" figures from 2020 to 2022.\n2. Answer must include a specific numerical prediction for 2023 capital expenditure.\n3. Prediction should be derived using linear regression on the provided data points.",
