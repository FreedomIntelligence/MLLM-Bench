    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could have caused the localized burning damage on this gas stove?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe localized burning damage on this gas stove appears to be caused by a food spill or boil-over that wasn't cleaned up promptly. The image shows a gas stove with two visible burners, and there's a noticeable yellow-brown residue around the left burner, particularly in the corner of the stove top.\n\nThis type of damage typically occurs when food or liquids spill onto the hot surface during cooking and are left to burn. Common scenarios that could lead to this include:\n\n1. A pot boiling over and the liquid burning onto the stove surface\n2. Food items falling out of a pan and getting charred\n3. Sugary substances spilling and caramelizing on the hot surface\n\nThe intense heat from the gas burner can cause these spills to burn, leaving behind a stubborn, discolored residue that's difficult to clean. Over time, if not addressed, these burnt-on spills can cause permanent damage to the stove's surface.\n\nTo prevent such damage in the future, it's important to clean spills immediately after they occur (once the surface has cooled enough to safely clean) and to regularly maintain the stove top. The damage shown in the image may require deep cleaning or potentially professional restoration to fully remove.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe localized burning damage on the gas stovetop could have been caused by a variety of factors. These may include overheating due to high heat settings, prolonged use, or an accumulation of food debris, grease, or other flammable materials on the surface. It is also possible that there may have been a malfunction or leak in the gas supply system, leading to uncontrolled burning. Additionally, the stove could have been mishandled accidentally, resulting in the damage. Regardless of the cause, it is essential to address such damage promptly to ensure the safety and proper functioning of the appliance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify possible causes for the localized burning on the gas stove, such as overboiling, high flame setting, flame impingement, combustible materials left on stove, delayed ignition, prolonged exposure to heat.",
