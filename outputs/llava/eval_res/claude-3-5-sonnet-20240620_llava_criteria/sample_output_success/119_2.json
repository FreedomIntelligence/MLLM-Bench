    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotion conveyed by the statue and analyze any symbolism that might be associated with the serenity of the expression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe statue in the image conveys a profound sense of serenity and inner peace. The facial expression is gentle and composed, with a subtle smile that suggests contentment and wisdom. The eyes are slightly downcast, which often symbolizes introspection, meditation, or a state of enlightenment in Buddhist and other Eastern spiritual traditions.\n\nThis serene expression is deeply symbolic, representing several key concepts:\n\n1. Enlightenment: The calm demeanor suggests a state of spiritual awakening or enlightenment, where one has transcended worldly concerns.\n\n2. Compassion: The gentle smile can be interpreted as an expression of universal compassion and benevolence towards all beings.\n\n3. Inner peace: The overall composure of the face symbolizes the attainment of inner peace and harmony.\n\n4. Wisdom: The serene expression often represents the wisdom that comes from deep spiritual understanding and self-realization.\n\nThe statue wears an ornate crown with multiple tiers, which likely represents the figure's elevated spiritual status or divine nature. The crown contains small seated figures, possibly representing Buddhas or bodhisattvas, which further emphasizes the spiritual significance of the statue.\n\nThe figure is dressed in flowing robes with intricate designs, and holds what appears to be a vessel or container in one hand. This object could symbolize abundance, the offering of teachings, or the containment of spiritual essences.\n\nThe overall symbolism of the statue's serenity, combined with its regal attire and attributes, suggests that this is a representation of a highly revered spiritual figure in Eastern religious tradition, possibly a bodhisattva or a deity associated with compassion, wisdom, and spiritual guidance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe statue displays a serene and calm expression, as the woman's eyes are half closed, and her lips are together in a peaceful manner. This peacefulness in the statue could symbolize various aspects such as tranquility, inner peace, contentment, or even enlightenment. The statue's serene expression is likely meant to evoke a sense of calmness and harmony, encouraging viewers to connect with their own inner peace and quiet reflection. The decorative headpiece and the overall design of the statue further emphasize the harmony and balance that the figure represents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotion of the statue's expression as serene, peaceful, or similar.\n2. Analyze symbolism related to the statue's serenity, like attire or objects held.",
