    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the silhouette image provided, we can analyze the postures and tools to determine the profession:\n\n1. Postures:\n   - One figure is bent over, actively working with a tool\n   - Three other figures are seated or crouching, observing the work\n   - The working posture suggests physical labor\n\n2. Tool:\n   - The main tool visible is clearly a pickaxe or similar digging implement\n   - This tool is being used in a downward striking motion\n\n3. Environment:\n   - The figures appear to be on uneven ground, possibly a work site\n   - The black silhouette against a white background suggests an outdoor setting\n\nGiven these observations, particularly the use of a pickaxe and the labor-intensive posture, the profession depicted is most likely that of miners or archaeologists. The presence of multiple figures, with one working and others observing, could indicate either:\n\na) A mining operation, where one miner is actively digging while others are resting or supervising\nb) An archaeological dig, where one person is carefully excavating while others observe or document the process\n\nConsidering the careful, observed nature of the work and the group dynamic, archaeology seems the more likely profession being depicted in this image. However, mining remains a possibility based on the tool and postures alone.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
