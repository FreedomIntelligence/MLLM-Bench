    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease infer the occupation of the adult depicted in the picture, taking into account his actions and role within the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the occupation of the adult depicted appears to be a teacher or educator. This inference is supported by several key elements in the scene:\n\n1. Classroom setting: The image shows a typical elementary school classroom environment with educational posters, a whiteboard, and classroom rules visible.\n\n2. Interaction with children: The adult is seated in front of a group of young children who are sitting on the floor, suggesting a teaching or storytelling scenario.\n\n3. Body language: The adult's posture and facial expression indicate engagement with the children, leaning forward and smiling, which is characteristic of a teacher interacting with students.\n\n4. Attire: The adult is dressed in smart casual clothing (light blue button-down shirt and khaki pants), which is appropriate for a teaching profession.\n\n5. Age difference: There's a clear age difference between the adult and the children, indicating an authority figure or educator role.\n\n6. Classroom arrangement: The setup of the children sitting in a semi-circle on the floor facing the adult is a common arrangement for classroom activities, especially in early education settings.\n\nGiven these observations, it's highly likely that the adult in the image is a teacher, specifically an elementary school teacher or early childhood educator.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nGiven the scene, with a man sitting in a chair surrounded by several young children and smiling, it is likely that the adult is a teacher or an educator. His role and interaction with the children indicate that he might be a teacher who is engaging with his students, teaching them or helping them learn in some way.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must infer the adult is a teacher based on his interaction with children and classroom setting.2. Check for the presence of educational materials or environment indicative of teaching.",
