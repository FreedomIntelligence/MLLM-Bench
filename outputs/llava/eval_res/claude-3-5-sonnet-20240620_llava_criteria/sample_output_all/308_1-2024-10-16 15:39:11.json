    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I reside in a location where the temperature is -5°C and need to select one of the sets of upper garments from the picture to wear, which one would provide better warmth?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the picture, one woman is wearing a coat and hat and is more bundled up than the others. If the temperature is -5°C, it's essential to prioritize warmth, so the woman's attire, including the coat and hat, would provide better warmth and protection from the cold. The coat and hat would ensure proper insulation and help maintain body heat in the cold weather. The other sets of upper garments may not offer the same level of warmth, and the woman in those sets might be less protected and more exposed to the cold.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFor a temperature of -5°C, which is quite cold, the outfit that would provide the best warmth among the options shown would be the one on the right side of the image. This outfit features a thick, fur-lined coat with long sleeves. The coat appears to be made of a heavy material, possibly leather or a similar sturdy fabric, with a fur or fleece lining visible at the collar and cuffs. This type of coat is designed for cold weather and would provide significant insulation against the cold.\n\nThe other outfits shown are less suitable for such cold temperatures:\n\n1. The left outfit is a form-fitting, long-sleeved dress that appears to be made of a thin, possibly sequined material. While it covers the arms, it doesn't seem to offer much insulation.\n\n2. The middle outfit consists of a black turtleneck top and loose pants. While the turtleneck might provide some warmth for the neck, the overall outfit doesn't appear to be thick enough for very cold temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the fur-lined coat on the right would be the best choice for warmth in -5°C weather among the options presented in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the right-most garment as providing better warmth.\n2. Justify warmth based on material, coverage, and layering visible in the image.",
