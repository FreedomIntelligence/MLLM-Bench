    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram) with the following leads: aVL, I, -aVR, II, aVF, III, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. Let's break down the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify any abnormalities:\n\nParts of the ECG waveform:\n1. P waves: Present and visible in most leads\n2. QRS complexes: Present in all leads\n3. T waves: Visible following each QRS complex\n4. Baseline: Relatively stable between complexes\n\nAbnormalities and observations:\n\n1. Rhythm: The rhythm appears to be irregular. There is variation in the R-R intervals, suggesting atrial fibrillation.\n\n2. P waves: While some deflections resembling P waves are visible, they are not consistently present before each QRS complex. This is consistent with atrial fibrillation.\n\n3. QRS complexes: \n   - Normal duration (not widened)\n   - Normal morphology in most leads\n   - Prominent R waves in V5 and V6, suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy\n\n4. ST segments: No significant ST-segment elevation or depression\n\n5. T waves: Normal morphology, no obvious inversions or abnormalities\n\n6. Rate: Appears to be within normal range (60-100 bpm), but irregular due to atrial fibrillation\n\n7. Axis: Appears to be normal (between -30째 and +90째)\n\n8. Intervals: PR interval cannot be assessed due to atrial fibrillation. QT interval appears normal.\n\nIn conclusion, the main abnormality in this ECG is atrial fibrillation, characterized by the irregular rhythm and absence of consistent P waves. There are also signs suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy based on the prominent R waves in the lateral leads (V5, V6). No acute ischemic changes are evident. This ECG would warrant further clinical correlation and possibly additional diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation and to assess for any structural heart disease.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
