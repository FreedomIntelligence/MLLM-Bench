    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the expressions of the people in the picture and infer possible reasons for her expressions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a woman with a confident and pleased expression. Her smile is warm and genuine, with slightly raised eyebrows that suggest a mix of happiness and perhaps a touch of surprise or excitement. \n\nThe woman is holding what appears to be an award or trophy, which likely explains her joyful expression. She's dressed in an elegant, sparkling gown with an elaborate diamond necklace, suggesting this is a formal event or awards ceremony.\n\nHer expression and body language indicate she's likely feeling:\n1. Pride in her achievement\n2. Gratitude for the recognition\n3. Excitement about the moment\n4. Possibly a bit of overwhelm from the attention\n\nThe setting and her attire, combined with the award, suggest this is a significant moment in her career or personal life. Her expression conveys that she's savoring the moment and feeling appreciative of the honor she's receiving.\n\nIn the background, there's a partial view of another person, but their expression isn't visible, so we can't infer anything about their emotions or reactions to the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a shiny dress and smiling while holding a silver statue with a red ribbon around her neck. Another man is looking off into the distance, appearing to be in deep thought. The woman's expressions indicate that she is happy and proud, likely due to winning an award or receiving recognition. The man's expression, on the other hand, suggests that he may be lost in thought, contemplating the moment or the significance of the event. His expression might also be a reflection of the intensity or concentration required in his role or responsibility during the event.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the specific facial expression (e.g., happy, surprised) of the person.",
