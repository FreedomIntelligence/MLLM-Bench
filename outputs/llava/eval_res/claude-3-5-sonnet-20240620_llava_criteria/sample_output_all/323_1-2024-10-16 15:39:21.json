    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happened to each row of the image from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom left to right, each row has one row with a man and the rest of the rows have women.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a progression of facial images from left to right in each row, demonstrating an increase in clarity and detail:\n\nRow 1: Starts with a highly pixelated red-toned image, gradually becoming clearer until a detailed face of a person with darker skin is visible.\n\nRow 2: Begins with a pixelated beige-toned image, progressively sharpening to reveal a clear image of a smiling person with lighter skin.\n\nRow 3: Initiates with a pixelated grayscale image, evolving into a clear picture of a person with glasses and darker hair.\n\nRow 4: Commences with a pixelated orange-toned image, developing into a detailed portrait of a smiling person with a darker skin tone.\n\nIn each row, the progression moves from a highly pixelated, almost unrecognizable image on the left to a clear, detailed facial portrait on the right. This sequence appears to demonstrate image enhancement or reconstruction techniques, possibly showcasing the capabilities of an AI or image processing algorithm.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the progression of image quality from left to right in each row.\n2. Confirm the presence of human faces in varying resolutions and clarity in the image.\n3. Assess if the description includes changes in detail and recognizability.",
