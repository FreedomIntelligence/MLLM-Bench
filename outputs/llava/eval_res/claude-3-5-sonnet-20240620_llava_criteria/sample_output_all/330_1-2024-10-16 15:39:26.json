    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, I can deduce that this disaster was likely intense but relatively short in duration, possibly a matter of minutes to hours. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The extent of damage: The image shows widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Houses are completely collapsed or severely damaged, with debris scattered across a large area. This level of destruction suggests a high-intensity event.\n\n2. Nature of the damage: The pattern of destruction appears consistent with a sudden, powerful force. Buildings are torn apart rather than showing signs of gradual deterioration, which points to a rapid onset disaster.\n\n3. Mud and debris flow: There's evidence of mud and debris scattered throughout the area, suggesting a possible landslide or flash flood. These types of events are typically intense but short-lived.\n\n4. Rescue operation stage: The image shows a large number of rescue workers (in blue uniforms) already on the scene and organized. This indicates that enough time has passed for a response to be mobilized, but the search and rescue phase is still active, suggesting the disaster occurred recently.\n\n5. Structural integrity: Some buildings, while damaged, are still partially standing. In a prolonged disaster (like extended flooding), we might expect to see more uniform, widespread collapse.\n\n6. Vegetation: Surrounding trees and vegetation appear relatively intact, which wouldn't be the case in a long-duration event like extended flooding or a prolonged earthquake sequence.\n\nGiven these observations, I would estimate that this disaster was likely a sudden, high-intensity event such as a powerful earthquake, a rapid landslide, or a flash flood, lasting anywhere from a few seconds (in the case of an earthquake) to perhaps a few hours (in the case of a flash flood or landslide). The intensity was clearly severe, given the extent of the damage and the large-scale rescue operation underway.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
