    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow many of the following five equations are correct? Please analyze the correctness of each equation for me\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nI'll analyze each equation for correctness:\n\n1) a³ ÷ a⁵ = a³⁻⁵ = a⁻² = 1/a² (a ≠ 0)\n   This equation is correct. When dividing exponential terms with the same base, we subtract the exponents. The negative exponent is then correctly expressed as a fraction.\n\n2) (0.0001)⁰ = (100000)⁰\n   This equation is correct. Any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Both sides of this equation equal 1.\n\n3) m³ ÷ m³ = m³⁻³ = m⁰ = 1\n   This equation is correct. When dividing the same terms, the exponents are subtracted, resulting in m⁰, which equals 1 for any non-zero m.\n\n4) 8x¹⁰ ÷ 2x² = 4x⁸\n   This equation is correct. 8 divided by 2 is 4, and x¹⁰ divided by x² is x⁸ (subtracting exponents).\n\n5) (x^n)² ÷ x^n = x²\n   This equation is incorrect. The left side should simplify to x^n, not x². The correct equation would be (x^n)² ÷ x^n = x^n.\n\nIn conclusion, 4 out of the 5 equations are correct.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are four correct equations out of the five provided. I will analyze each equation for correctness:\n\n1. A, B, C, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\nCorrect: This is a list of numbers from 1 to 21.\n2. A, B, C, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 14.\nIncorrect: The equation is missing the proper exponentiation notation for the number 6.\n3. A = B + C.\nCorrect: This is a simple algebraic equation that defines the relationship between variables A, B, and C.\n4. A = 0.4B + 0.6C.\nCorrect: This is another algebraic equation that uses variables A, B, and C for calculation.\n5. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nCorrect: This is an alphabetical order list of letters, including upper and lowercase.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct equations are 1, 3, and 4.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the VLM identifies the correct and incorrect equations (first and second are correct).\n2. Ensure the VLM provides mathematical reasoning for each equation's correctness.\n3. Check that the VLM's total count of correct equations matches the answer (2).",
