    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThere is a dice in the image. Can you describe its approximate position in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe dice is located in the top center of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe dice can be found in the upper right quadrant of the image. It's positioned among the cheese blocks, appearing as a yellow cube with visible dots on one face, resembling a typical die. The dice blends in with the cheese pieces due to its similar color, making it a bit tricky to spot at first glance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must specify dice is in the top-right corner of the image.\n2. Mention the dice's proximity to a mouse on its right.\n3. Description of dice's position should be relative to other objects, not just the image frame.",
