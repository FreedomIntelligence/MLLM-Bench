    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify and describe every element present in the image, including text blocks, images, and decorative elements, and provide a brief explanation of their purpose within the layout of a newspaper page.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is an old newspaper page featuring a large black and white photograph of a family. The entire page is headlined with \"Good Times Today!\", indicating that the photograph showcases a pleasant and happy moment for the family. The family members include both children and adults, portraying a diverse and close-knit gathering.\n\nThe photograph is surrounded by several text blocks, providing information or descriptions related to the family or the event depicted. Some of the text is in a distinctive font, making it easily readable and emphasizing the importance of the information displayed. An aerial image can be seen in the background of the photograph, showing the outdoor setting where the family is posing, possibly a garden or a yard.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image represents the front page of a newspaper called \"Ye Ole Londoner.\" Here's a breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. Masthead: \n   - Newspaper title \"Ye Ole Londoner\" in large, gothic-style font\n   - Motto in top left: \"The pen is mightier than the sword!\"\n   - Weather report in top right\n   - Volume and issue number, website, and price information below the title\n\n2. Main Headline: \"GOOD TIMES TODAY!\" in large, bold letters\n\n3. Main Image: A large black and white photograph of a family group, described as \"An 18th century land developer with investments in gold bullion. A rather small family of 5 children.\"\n\n4. Secondary Image: A smaller black and white photograph on the right, captioned \"A lovely family on their way to church\"\n\n5. Article Headlines and Text:\n   - \"Another headline\" with accompanying text\n   - \"A descriptive headline goes in here\" with accompanying text\n\n6. Third Image: A photograph of a building, captioned \"The Maddison's House on Broadway\"\n\n7. Advertisement Space: At the bottom, a decorative box states \"Advertisement Goes Here!\" flanked by crown icons\n\nThe layout is typical of a traditional newspaper front page, with a clear hierarchy of information. The large headline and main image draw immediate attention, while smaller articles and images provide additional content. The advertisement space at the bottom is a common feature, allowing for paid content.\n\nThe overall design mimics an old-fashioned newspaper style, with gothic fonts and formal language, creating a nostalgic or historical atmosphere. The content seems to be a mix of serious news and lighter, positive stories, as suggested by the \"GOOD TIMES TODAY!\" headline.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe all textual elements, including headlines, captions, and body text, noting font sizes and styles.\n2. Describe images and their placement, including the family photo and building, with their captions.\n3. Note decorative elements like borders or graphics, and their role in the layout, such as the crown graphic for an advertisement.",
