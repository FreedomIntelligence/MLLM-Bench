    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nCT Brain Report\n\nTechnique: Non-contrast axial CT scan of the brain\n\nFindings:\n\n1. Large hypodense area in the right cerebral hemisphere, measuring approximately 7-8 cm in diameter, consistent with an acute or subacute infarct in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA).\n\n2. Significant mass effect associated with the infarct, causing:\n   - Midline shift to the left of approximately 1.5 cm\n   - Compression of the right lateral ventricle\n   - Effacement of cortical sulci in the right hemisphere\n\n3. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n4. Left cerebral hemisphere appears normal with no focal lesions.\n\n5. Basal cisterns are partially compressed but still visible.\n\n6. No obvious skull fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nImpression:\n\n1. Large right MCA territory infarct with significant mass effect and midline shift, suggesting a possible malignant MCA infarction.\n\n2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n3. Urgent neurosurgical consultation is recommended to evaluate for potential decompressive hemicraniectomy, given the extent of the infarct and mass effect.\n\n4. Close monitoring for neurological deterioration is crucial.\n\n5. Consider follow-up imaging to assess progression of edema and mass effect.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
