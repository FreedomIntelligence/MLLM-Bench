Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify a hair dryer in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, there is a hair dryer in the image, which is placed next to a mirror and surrounded by cosmetics and other beauty supplies.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nI apologize, but I don't see a hair dryer in this image.
