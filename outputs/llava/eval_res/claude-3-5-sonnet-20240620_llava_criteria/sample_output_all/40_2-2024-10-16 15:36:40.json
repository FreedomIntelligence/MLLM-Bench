    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of mushroom is it in the image? Is it edible?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe mushrooms in the image appear to be from the genus Mycena, commonly known as bonnet mushrooms. They have the characteristic bell-shaped or conical caps and thin stems typical of Mycena species. The mushrooms are growing in a cluster on what looks like decaying wood or bark, surrounded by moss and other forest floor vegetation.\n\nRegarding edibility, Mycena mushrooms are generally considered inedible. While they're not known to be highly toxic, most species in this genus are too small and fragile to be of culinary interest. Additionally, some Mycena species can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.\n\nIt's important to note that accurate mushroom identification often requires more than just a photograph. Factors like spore print, habitat, and microscopic features are often necessary for definitive identification. Therefore, it's always best to consult with an expert mycologist before considering any wild mushroom for consumption.\n\nAs a general rule, it's safest to admire wild mushrooms for their beauty and ecological role rather than considering them as a food source unless you have expert knowledge in mushroom identification.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white mushrooms growing on top of a rock. It is not possible to definitively determine if these mushrooms are edible or not just based on the image. However, a proper identification could be done if more characteristics like the mushroom's shape, texture, and presence of any gills or pores were visible. Generally, it is advisable to avoid consuming wild mushrooms without proper identification due to the risk of consuming toxic or harmful species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify mushroom as \"galerina marginata.\"\n2. State the mushroom is not edible.\n3. Ensure the answer is based on visual characteristics of the mushroom in the image.",
