    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the possible badminton stroke being performed by the player.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe possible badminton stroke being performed by the player is a serve. The man is seen jumping while holding a racquet, which is a common technique used in serving to generate more power and precision in the shot. The serve is an important part of a badminton game, as it initiates play and sets the tone for the rest of the rally.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the badminton player appears to be performing a smash stroke. This can be inferred from the player's body position and racket placement:\n\n1. The player is jumping high with their body arched backwards.\n2. The racket is raised high above the head.\n3. The player's arm is fully extended, suggesting a powerful downward motion.\n\nThe smash is an offensive stroke in badminton, typically used to hit the shuttle downwards at a steep angle and at high speed towards the opponent's court. It's one of the most powerful shots in badminton and is often used as an attacking move to win points.\n\nThe setting of the image appears to be a professional badminton match, likely at a major event in London, as indicated by the \"LOND\" visible on the court border. There are cameras and media personnel visible in the background, further suggesting this is a high-profile competition.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the stroke as either a clear or a smash based on player's posture and racket position.",
