    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the evolution of presidential automobiles shown in this image, we can infer some potential future automotive design trends:\n\n1. Increased aerodynamics: The progression from boxy, carriage-like designs to more streamlined shapes suggests future cars may become even more aerodynamic.\n\n2. Larger interiors: There's a clear trend towards larger, more spacious vehicles, which may continue with an emphasis on comfort and luxury for high-end vehicles.\n\n3. Safety features: While not explicitly shown, the evolution implies increased safety measures, which will likely continue to be a priority in future designs.\n\n4. Integration of technology: Future presidential vehicles will probably incorporate advanced technology for communication, security, and possibly autonomous driving capabilities.\n\n5. Environmental considerations: Given the presence of an early electric car (1912 Baker Electric), we might see a return to electric or other alternative fuel sources for presidential vehicles.\n\n6. Customization: The variety of designs suggests that future vehicles may be highly customized to meet specific presidential needs and preferences.\n\n7. Blend of tradition and innovation: While incorporating new technologies, future designs may still retain some classic elements to maintain a sense of dignity and tradition associated with the office.\n\n8. Enhanced security features: Though not visible in these illustrations, future presidential vehicles will likely have even more advanced security and protective features integrated into their design.\n\nThese inferences are based on the historical progression shown in the image, current automotive trends, and the unique requirements of presidential transportation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
