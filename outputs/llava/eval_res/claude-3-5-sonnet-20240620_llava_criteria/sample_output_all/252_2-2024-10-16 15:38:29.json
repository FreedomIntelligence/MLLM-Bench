    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side closely to identify and compare the differences between them as much as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAfter examining both images closely, I can identify the following differences:\n\n1. Belt: In the right image, the dog character on the right is wearing a belt, which is not present in the left image.\n\n2. Stripes on shirt: The dog character on the right has more distinct and clearly defined stripes on their shirt in the right image compared to the left image.\n\n3. Grass detail: The grass at the bottom of the image appears to have slightly more detail or definition in the left image compared to the right image.\n\n4. Line quality: The overall line quality of the drawings seems slightly crisper or more defined in the right image.\n\nOther than these subtle differences, the images are nearly identical. Both show two anthropomorphic dog characters standing on grass, with one holding a book or notebook. Their poses, expressions, and overall attire remain the same in both images.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are two different representations of a puppy on a leash carrying a backpack. The two images can be distinguished by analyzing the expressions of the cute puppy. While the puppy is walking, it has a distinctive smile on its face, indicating that it is happy and enjoying the moment. In various locations throughout the images, you can also see the grass on the ground, adding to the visual context of the scene. The two different expressions of the puppy and the overall atmosphere in both pictures can be compared, highlighting the variations in their expressions and the overall scene they depict.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences: eye color, belt, shirt stripes, facial hair, eyebrow, socks, left dog's bag, left dog's eyelash, left dog's mouth wrinkle.\n2. Ensure all differences listed in the reference are mentioned accurately.\n3. Compare both images for any additional differences not listed in the reference.",
