    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the color, shape and other attribute you think would be useful for people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a striking plant with distinctive coloration and shape:\n\nColor:\n- The plant has leaves that are primarily bright yellow with green centers\n- The yellow is vibrant and eye-catching, contrasting sharply with the surrounding greenery\n\nShape:\n- The plant has broad, oval-shaped leaves\n- The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a compact, rounded cluster\n- Each leaf has a slightly wavy or rippled edge\n\nOther attributes:\n- The plant appears to be a type of hosta, a popular shade-loving perennial\n- It's growing in what looks like a garden bed with mulch or wood chips\n- The plant stands out dramatically against the darker soil and surrounding vegetation\n- Its size suggests it's a mature plant, possibly 1-2 feet in diameter\n- The variegated coloration (yellow edges, green centers) is a key identifying feature\n- The plant looks healthy and well-maintained\n\nThese characteristics, particularly the unique yellow and green variegation and the distinctive leaf shape, make this plant easily recognizable and likely a focal point in the garden setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a beautiful, multicolored plant with vibrant green and yellow leaves. The plant exhibits an interesting and colorful flower pattern, making it a striking and attractive feature in the garden. The plant's bright leaves and blooms create an eye-catching and lively effect, adding a unique touch of natural beauty to the garden.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
