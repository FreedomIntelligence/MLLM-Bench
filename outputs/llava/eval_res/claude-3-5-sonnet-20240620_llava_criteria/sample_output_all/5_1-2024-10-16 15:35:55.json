    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and point out the difference between it and the general fan.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a portable space heater, often referred to as a small stove, sitting next to a black control panel. The heater has a circular fan next to it that can be used for direct heating of a small area. This is different from a general fan, as the heater is designed for providing warmth and comfort instead of just circulating air or cooling. The heater and the fan are both black and compact, making them suitable for personal use and travel. However, the heater is specifically designed for heating purposes and is not a general appliance like a regular fan.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a space heater, specifically a portable electric heater with oscillation capability.\n\nThe main differences between this space heater and a general fan are:\n\n1. Purpose: While a fan circulates air to cool a space, this device generates heat to warm a room.\n\n2. Heating element: The space heater has a visible heating element, shown by the orange glow in the image, which produces heat. A regular fan doesn't have this feature.\n\n3. Temperature control: The heater has a digital display and control panel on top, likely for temperature settings, which is not typical for standard fans.\n\n4. Oscillation range: The image shows a 60° oscillation range, which is designed for distributing heat. Fans typically have a wider oscillation range.\n\n5. Safety features: Space heaters often have more safety features, such as tip-over protection and overheat protection, which may not be present in regular fans.\n\n6. Remote control: This heater comes with a remote control, which is less common for standard fans.\n\n7. Design: The heater has a more enclosed design with a perforated front panel to protect users from the heating element, unlike the exposed blades of a typical fan.\n\nIn summary, while both devices manipulate air in a room, their functions, design, and features are quite different due to their distinct purposes of heating versus cooling.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a heater, not a fan.\n2. Note the heater's heat emission, contrasting with a fan's air circulation.",
