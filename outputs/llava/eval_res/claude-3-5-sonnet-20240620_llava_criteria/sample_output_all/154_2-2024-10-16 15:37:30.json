    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image depicts a highly disciplined and ceremonial event taking place in front of Buckingham Palace in London. The elements of discipline and ceremony are clearly visible in several aspects:\n\n1. Uniformity: The soldiers, who appear to be members of the Queen's Guard, are dressed in identical red tunics, black trousers, and tall bearskin hats. This uniformity demonstrates strict adherence to dress codes and regulations.\n\n2. Formation: The guards are marching in a precise, orderly formation, showcasing their discipline and training.\n\n3. Synchronized movement: The guards appear to be moving in unison, which requires extensive practice and coordination.\n\n4. Ceremonial flag: One guard is carrying what appears to be a regimental flag or colors, a key element in military ceremonies.\n\n5. Location: The ceremony is taking place in front of the iconic Buckingham Palace, emphasizing its official and ceremonial nature.\n\n6. Spectators: A crowd of onlookers can be seen behind barriers, indicating this is a public ceremonial event, likely the Changing of the Guard or a similar royal ceremony.\n\n7. Precision: The guards' posture and alignment demonstrate a high level of attention to detail and discipline.\n\n8. Traditional attire: The distinctive uniforms, including the bearskin hats, are steeped in historical tradition and ceremony.\n\nThese elements combine to create a scene of great pageantry, discipline, and ceremonial importance, typical of royal and military traditions in the United Kingdom.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3. Mention the context suggesting a multicultural event.",
