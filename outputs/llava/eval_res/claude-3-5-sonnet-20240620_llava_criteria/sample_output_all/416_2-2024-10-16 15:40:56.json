    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image showcases an exquisite piece of carved wooden art, featuring a mesmerizing mandala-like design of intricate geometric patterns. The artwork is characterized by its radial symmetry, emanating from a central circular motif. Layers of petals or leaves unfold outward, creating a sense of depth and dimension through overlapping shapes and varying wood tones.\n\nThe carving technique employed demonstrates exceptional skill, with precise, fine lines etched into the wood to create texture and shadow. The patterns consist of repeating arcs, curves, and angular forms that interlock and flow seamlessly into one another. The depth of the carving is evident in the multiple layers visible, from the raised outer frame to the recessed inner sections.\n\nThe wood grain itself contributes to the overall texture, with subtle variations in color ranging from light beige to deeper amber tones. This natural coloration adds warmth and organic beauty to the geometric precision of the design.\n\nThe artwork balances complexity with order, featuring both symmetrical elements in its overall structure and asymmetrical details within individual sections. The interplay of light and shadow across the carved surfaces enhances the three-dimensional quality of the piece, inviting the eye to explore its many intricate details and layers.\n\nThis stunning example of wood carving artistry showcases the harmonious blend of natural materials with mathematical precision and artistic vision, resulting in a captivating and meditative visual experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wooden piece is carved into an intricate flower pattern, and it features a star shape in the center, giving the impression of a sunburst. The carving creates a layered textured surface on the wood, adding depth and visual interest. The design is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, with the flower petals following a regular pattern, yet the varying sizes and shapes of the petals make the overall design feel unique and dynamic. The combination of the carved flower and the starburst center make this piece a striking piece of artistry and craftsmanship.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Describe the intricate patterns, including shapes and lines, and their arrangement.\n2. Mention the depth and texture of the carved wood, indicating 3D effect or flatness.\n3. Identify symmetrical or asymmetrical elements, noting repetition or variance.",
