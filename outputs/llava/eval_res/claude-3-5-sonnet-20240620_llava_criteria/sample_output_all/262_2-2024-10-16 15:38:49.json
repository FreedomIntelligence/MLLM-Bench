    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows people covering their faces and bodies with cloth and veils due to a severe sandstorm or dust storm. This weather phenomenon is common in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly deserts.\n\nThe reasons for covering their faces are:\n1. Protection from sand and dust particles in the air\n2. Shielding eyes and respiratory system from irritation\n3. Reducing exposure to the harsh environment\n\nThe weather occurrence (sandstorm/dust storm) is caused by several factors:\n\n1. Strong winds: High-speed winds can lift loose sand and dust particles into the air.\n\n2. Dry conditions: Lack of moisture in the soil makes it easier for particles to become airborne.\n\n3. Lack of vegetation: Desert areas have little plant cover to hold soil in place.\n\n4. Atmospheric instability: Temperature differences can create updrafts that lift particles.\n\n5. Human activities: Overgrazing, deforestation, and poor land management can contribute to increased dust in some regions.\n\nThe image also shows people pulling containers, likely for water, and a donkey with a cart, indicating they're traveling or transporting goods despite the harsh conditions. This suggests that such storms are a regular occurrence in this area, and people have adapted to live and work through them.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
