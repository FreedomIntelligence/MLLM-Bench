    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image portrays a strong emotion of distress, fear, or rejection. The person in the photo has their hand raised in a defensive gesture, palm outward, signaling a clear \"stop\" or \"stay away\" message. Their other hand is covering their mouth, which could indicate shock, an attempt to suppress emotion, or a protective instinct.\n\nThe emotion being expressed appears to be a mix of anxiety, fear, and possibly shame or embarrassment. The body language suggests the person is trying to create distance or shield themselves from something or someone.\n\nSeveral contexts or situations that could be causing this emotion include:\n\n1. Encountering an unexpected or threatening situation in public.\n2. Reacting to shocking or upsetting news.\n3. Trying to avoid unwanted attention or harassment.\n4. Experiencing a panic attack or moment of intense anxiety.\n5. Attempting to maintain personal boundaries in an uncomfortable social situation.\n6. Reacting to a confrontation or argument.\n7. Trying to hide from someone or something.\n8. Experiencing a moment of intense shame or embarrassment in public.\n9. Reacting to a sudden loud noise or startling event.\n10. Attempting to protect oneself from physical or emotional harm.\n\nThe outdoor setting with foliage in the background suggests this is happening in a public space, which could add to the intensity of the emotion if the person feels exposed or vulnerable.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
