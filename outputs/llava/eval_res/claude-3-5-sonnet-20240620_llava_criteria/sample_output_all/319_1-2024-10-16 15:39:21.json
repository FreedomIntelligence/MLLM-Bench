    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the answer to this expression?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe expression shown on the paper involves a calculation of the determinant for a 2x2 matrix, which requires a little more information to determine the answer definitively. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndet(A) = a\\_11 \\* a\\_22 - a\\_12 \\* a\\_21\n\nIn this case, it is not possible to provide the exact answer without the values of the elements of the 2x2 matrix. To find the determinant, you need to know the specific values of a\\_11, a\\_12, a\\_21, and a\\_22.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe expression shown in the image is:\n\n∫ (2x / ((x+1)(x^2+1)^2)) dx\n\nThis is an integral that requires solving. Without performing the full integration, I can't provide the final answer. Solving this integral would involve techniques such as partial fraction decomposition and possibly trigonometric substitution, depending on the approach taken. The solution would be a function of x plus a constant of integration.\n\nIf you need the actual solution, I'd recommend working through the integration steps or using a computer algebra system for the precise result. The process to solve this integral is quite involved and would require several steps.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly solve the integral expression shown in the image.\n2. Matches answer: 2*(x - 1)/(4*x**2 + 4) - log(x + 1)/2 + log(x**2 + 1)/4.\n3. Explanation is mathematically sound and aligns with visual math reasoning.",
