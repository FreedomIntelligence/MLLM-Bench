    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe exercise shown in the image is the bench press. This is a fundamental strength training exercise that primarily targets the chest muscles (pectorals), but also engages the shoulders (anterior deltoids) and triceps.\n\nTechnical essentials of the bench press include:\n\n1. Proper form: The person is lying flat on a bench with feet planted firmly on the ground.\n\n2. Grip: Hands are gripping the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. Bar path: The barbell should be lowered to the mid-chest area and pressed straight up.\n\n4. Breathing: Inhale as the bar is lowered, exhale as it's pressed up.\n\n5. Range of motion: Lower the bar until it lightly touches the chest, then press it back up to full arm extension.\n\n6. Safety: Always use a spotter or safety catches when lifting heavy weights.\n\n7. Equipment: A barbell and weight plates are used, along with a sturdy bench.\n\nThe bench press is an excellent exercise for building upper body strength and muscle mass, particularly in the chest area. Proper technique is crucial to maximize benefits and prevent injury.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
