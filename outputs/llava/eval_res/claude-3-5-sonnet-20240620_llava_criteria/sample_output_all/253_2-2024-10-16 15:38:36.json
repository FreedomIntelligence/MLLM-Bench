    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two pictures closely to identify differences between them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAfter examining the two images closely, I've identified the following differences:\n\n1. The logo in the top left corner of the left image is missing in the right image.\n\n2. The child's hair length is different - longer in the left image, shorter in the right image.\n\n3. There's a wreath on the gingerbread house in the left image, which is missing in the right image.\n\n4. The color of the decorations above the door of the gingerbread house is different - red in the left image, yellow in the right image.\n\n5. The snowflakes in the background are positioned differently between the two images.\n\n6. The text \"Oxymax Playroom\" appears in the bottom right corner of the right image but is not present in the left image.\n\n7. The border color of the frames is different - blue in the left image, red in the right image.\n\nThese are the 7 differences I've noticed between the two images.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two pictures depict a girl in a red Santa hat working on decorating a gingerbread house. In one scene, she is putting the finishing touches on the house by applying a green decoration on the roof. In the other scene, she is placing a ribbon on the house. Both pictures capture the creative process of building and decorating a gingerbread house, showcasing the attention to detail and care put into the project.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in hat, hair, collar, shadow on face, shirt stripes, decoration above toy house floor.",
