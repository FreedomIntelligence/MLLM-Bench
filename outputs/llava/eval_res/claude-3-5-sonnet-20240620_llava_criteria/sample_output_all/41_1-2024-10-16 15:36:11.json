    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat ingredients are used to make the dish shown in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe dish shown in the picture contains corn and lime as key ingredients.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe dish shown in the image appears to be grilled or fried octopus tentacles. The main ingredients visible are:\n\n1. Octopus tentacles: These are the primary component of the dish, showing the distinctive suction cup pattern characteristic of octopus.\n\n2. Lime: There's a wedge of lime in the bowl, which is likely used for squeezing over the octopus to add acidity and freshness.\n\n3. Seasoning: While not explicitly visible, the octopus appears to be seasoned and possibly marinated, given its golden-brown color. This could involve ingredients like olive oil, garlic, herbs, and spices.\n\nThe octopus is served in a brown ceramic bowl, placed on what looks like a menu or wine list from a restaurant called \"Fallow\". The presentation suggests this is likely an appetizer or tapas-style dish served at an upscale restaurant.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify corn ribs and lemon as ingredients in the dish.\n2. Evaluate the completeness of the ingredient list provided.\n3. Assess accuracy in recognizing additional ingredients, if any.",
