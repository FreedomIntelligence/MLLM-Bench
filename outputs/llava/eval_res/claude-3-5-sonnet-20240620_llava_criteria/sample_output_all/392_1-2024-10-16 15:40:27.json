    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict which watch characteristics will dominate in the next decade.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, which features a timeline of various tuna types, it is difficult to predict which watch characteristics will dominate the next decade. However, since the timeline represents different types of tuna and their developments, it is more likely to focus on the evolution of tuna species or their attributes, such as size, taste, and health benefits. Therefore, the expected trend would be to promote healthier and more sustainably sourced tuna options rather than focusing on watch features or characteristics that do not relate to the primary subject of the timeline.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the Seiko Tuna timeline provided, we can predict several watch characteristics that may dominate in the next decade:\n\n1. Advanced materials: The trend shows increasing use of innovative materials like titanium, ceramic, and special coatings. We might see more watches using high-tech, durable, and lightweight materials.\n\n2. Improved water resistance: Many models in the timeline boast impressive depth ratings (300m, 600m, 1000m). Future watches may push these limits even further.\n\n3. Specialized functions: The evolution of the Tuna line shows a focus on professional diving features. We may see more watches with highly specialized functions for various activities or professions.\n\n4. Sustainability: Given global trends, we might see more eco-friendly materials and manufacturing processes in watch production.\n\n5. Heritage-inspired designs: The timeline shows several reissues and homages to older models. This trend of vintage-inspired pieces may continue.\n\n6. Technological integration: While not explicitly shown in this mechanical watch timeline, the broader watch industry is moving towards smart features. We might see more hybrid watches combining traditional craftsmanship with modern technology.\n\n7. Limited editions: The timeline features several limited production runs, suggesting this trend may continue to appeal to collectors.\n\n8. Modular designs: Some models show interchangeable parts (like shrouds or bracelets). This customization trend might expand.\n\n9. Enhanced legibility: Many models focus on clear, easy-to-read dials. This crucial feature for professional use will likely remain important.\n\n10. Durability: The Tuna line's focus on robust construction for professional use suggests continued emphasis on creating long-lasting, reliable timepieces.\n\nThese predictions are based on the trends visible in this specific Seiko Tuna timeline and general watch industry trends. The actual dominant characteristics may vary depending on technological advancements, consumer preferences, and global events.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify historical trends in watch features from the timeline.\n2. Predict future trends in materials, technology, or design elements.\n3. Answer must be plausible and reflect evolution from past to future.",
