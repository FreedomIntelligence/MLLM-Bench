    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the type of dance based on dancers' attire and movement.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the dancers' attire and movement in this image, the type of dance appears to be ballroom dancing, specifically a Latin dance style such as the Paso Doble or Argentine Tango.\n\nThe image shows a dramatic pose with a male dancer supporting a female dancer in a dynamic lift. The female dancer's body is arched backwards with her leg extended high, creating a striking line. Her hair is flying, suggesting rapid movement. The male dancer is in a strong, upright stance, providing support and leading the movement.\n\nTheir attire is characteristic of ballroom dance costumes:\n- The man is wearing a dark, fitted suit or tailcoat, typical for ballroom competitions and performances.\n- The woman is wearing a dark, form-fitting dress that appears to have some flow to it, allowing for dramatic movement.\n\nThe intensity of the pose, the formal attire, and the partner work are all indicative of ballroom dance styles, particularly those with Latin influences that incorporate more passionate and dramatic movements.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe type of dance depicted in the image is ballet, as the male and female dancers are wearing black clothing and demonstrating graceful movements characteristic of ballet. The man is lifting the woman in a split while standing, and she is reaching upwards with her arms, which are typical ballet positions and techniques. The dancers' black attire also suggests a formal or professional performance, further supporting the notion that they are participating in a ballet routine.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify dance type by analyzing attire, such as dress style and shoes.\n2. Assess the dance based on visible movement, like posture and interaction.\n3. Ensure the answer is specific to the image, not a generic dance description.",
