    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two planets: Earth (on the left) and Mars (on the right). Let's compare and contrast their atmospheric conditions and surface features:\n\n1. Atmosphere:\n   - Earth: The image clearly shows a thick, dynamic atmosphere. There are visible cloud formations, indicating a substantial presence of water vapor. The atmosphere appears blue-white, suggesting scattering of sunlight.\n   - Mars: The atmosphere is much less visible. There are no obvious cloud formations, indicating a much thinner atmosphere. A slight haze can be seen around the edges, but it's far less prominent than Earth's.\n\n2. Color:\n   - Earth: Predominantly blue (oceans) and white (clouds), with visible brown and green landmasses.\n   - Mars: Uniformly reddish-orange, earning its nickname \"The Red Planet\" due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface.\n\n3. Surface Features:\n   - Earth: Clearly visible continents and oceans. Land masses appear in various shades of brown and green, indicating diverse terrain including deserts, forests, and other ecosystems. Large white areas at the poles suggest ice caps.\n   - Mars: The surface appears more uniform, but some darker regions are visible, possibly indicating elevation changes or different surface compositions. A white spot at the bottom (likely the south pole) suggests a polar ice cap.\n\n4. Size:\n   - Earth appears significantly larger in the image, reflecting its actual larger size compared to Mars.\n\n5. Water presence:\n   - Earth: Large blue areas clearly indicate the presence of liquid water in the form of oceans.\n   - Mars: No visible signs of liquid water on the surface, though the polar ice cap might contain water ice.\n\nIn summary, Earth shows a vibrant, dynamic system with clear signs of a substantial atmosphere and diverse surface features including large bodies of water. Mars, in contrast, appears more uniform and static, with a much less prominent atmosphere and no visible liquid water on its surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
