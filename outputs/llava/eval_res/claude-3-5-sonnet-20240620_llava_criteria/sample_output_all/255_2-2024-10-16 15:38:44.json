    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis illustration showcases four different species of big cats, each with distinct features:\n\n1. Tiger (top left): Characterized by its orange coat with black stripes. It has a large, muscular body with a long tail. The face shows prominent whiskers and round ears.\n\n2. Lion (bottom left): Distinguished by its tawny coat and the male's iconic mane surrounding the face. It has a robust body, strong limbs, and a tufted tail.\n\n3. Mountain Lion or Cougar (top right): Depicted with a uniform tan or light brown coat without spots or stripes. It has a sleek body, a long tail, and a relatively small head compared to the other cats.\n\n4. Lioness with cubs (bottom right): This shows a female lion, lacking the mane of the male, with a tawny coat. She's accompanied by two small cubs, illustrating the species' social nature.\n\nKey differences include:\n- Coat patterns: Striped (tiger), plain (lion and mountain lion), or spotted (cubs)\n- Body shape: Varying from the muscular build of the tiger and lion to the leaner form of the mountain lion\n- Facial features: The lion's mane is a standout feature, while the tiger has more prominent whiskers\n- Tail length and shape: The mountain lion has a particularly long tail, while the lion's tail has a tuft at the end\n\nThese illustrations effectively highlight the unique characteristics that distinguish these big cat species from one another.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
