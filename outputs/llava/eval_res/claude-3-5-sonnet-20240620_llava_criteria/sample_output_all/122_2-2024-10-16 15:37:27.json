    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the possible emotional dynamics of the coupleâ€™s interaction based on their seating posture and orientation towards each other.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a couple in a very joyful and intimate pose.

The woman's mouth is wide open in what appears to be laughter or an excited exclamation, while the man has a broad smile. These expressions indicate they are sharing a moment of intense happiness or celebration.\n\nThe man is supporting the woman, which could symbolize mutual support in their relationship. The fact that they are engaging in such a playful pose suggests a relationship filled with fun and spontaneity.\n\nTheir bodies are oriented towards the camera, but their faces are turned slightly towards each other, indicating a strong connection between them while also engaging with their surroundings.\n\nThe outdoor, natural setting with soft focus in the background adds to the romantic and joyful atmosphere of the image.\n\nOverall, the couple's posture and orientation suggest a relationship characterized by joy, intimacy, playfulness, and mutual support. They appear to be very comfortable with each other and are likely sharing a significant happy moment or milestone.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the man is holding the woman in his arms while she is smiling.
