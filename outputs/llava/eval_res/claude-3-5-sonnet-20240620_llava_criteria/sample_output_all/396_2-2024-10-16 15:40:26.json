    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image represents a humorous take on human evolution, specifically focusing on the evolution of technology and posture. The trend shown is a progression from early hominids to modern humans, with each stage depicting a change in posture and tool use.\n\nThe stages shown are:\n\n1. A crouching primate-like figure\n2. An upright walking early human\n3. A hunched figure using a primitive tool (club)\n4. A figure using more advanced tools (possibly representing early agriculture or hunting)\n5. A figure using a tool that requires more dexterity (possibly representing early craftsmanship)\n6. A modern human standing upright but hunched over a small device (likely a smartphone)\n\nThe trend shows how humans have progressed from primitive forms to more advanced beings, but with a twist at the end suggesting that modern technology might be causing us to regress in terms of posture and physical engagement with our environment.\n\nPredicting the next stage based on this trend, we might expect to see:\n\n7. A figure even more integrated with technology, possibly depicting:\n   - A person with wearable tech or augmented reality devices\n   - A human-machine hybrid or cyborg\n   - A virtual avatar, suggesting a move towards digital existence\n   - A figure with an even more pronounced \"tech neck\" or hunched posture due to prolonged device use\n\nAlternatively, the next stage could show a deliberate reversal of this trend, with humans actively trying to disconnect from technology and return to a more natural state of being. This could be represented by a figure standing fully upright, engaged with the natural world, and free from technological devices.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
