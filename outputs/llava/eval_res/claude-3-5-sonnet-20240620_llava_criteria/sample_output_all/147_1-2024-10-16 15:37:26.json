    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humorous elements in this image include:\n\n1. The contrast between the formal, aristocratic portrait and the actual dog\n2. The dog's goofy, toothy grin that matches the expression in the portrait\n3. The unexpected pairing of a small, scruffy dog with a noble, Victorian-style painting\n4. The implication that the dog bought an unnecessary, grandiose portrait of itself\n\nBackstory:\n\nMax, a lovable but mischievous Shih Tzu, had always lived a comfortable life with his owner, Sarah. Sarah, a freelance graphic designer, often struggled to make ends meet between paychecks. Max, blissfully unaware of financial concerns, lived each day filled with walks, treats, and belly rubs.\n\nOne fateful month, Sarah landed a big project that came with a substantial paycheck. Excited by the influx of cash, she decided to treat herself and Max to some online shopping. While browsing, she stumbled upon a website that created custom pet portraits in various styles.\n\nAmused by the idea, Sarah uploaded a photo of Max and selected the \"Victorian Nobleman\" option, thinking it would be a small, funny addition to her apartment decor. However, in her excitement, she misread the dimensions and price, accidentally ordering a life-sized, ornate, and very expensive portrait.\n\nWhen the massive painting arrived, Sarah was shocked but couldn't help laughing at the absurdity of it all. She propped it against the wall, planning to return it the next day. But as she stepped back, she noticed Max trotting into the room, sporting the exact same goofy grin as his painted counterpart.\n\nThe sight of Max, small and scruffy, next to his grand, aristocratic alter-ego was too perfect. Sarah quickly snapped a photo, capturing the moment of Max's apparent pride in his unnecessary but hilarious payday splurge. The portrait stayed, becoming a conversation piece and a reminder of the joy that can come from life's little extravagances.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
