    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the human movement and environment in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image captures an exhilarating moment of extreme mountain biking. A cyclist is shown mid-air, performing a jump on a rugged mountain terrain. The rider is wearing protective gear including a full-face helmet with goggles, a black tank top, and orange shorts. They are gripping the handlebars of a mountain bike, which appears to be a high-end model suitable for this challenging terrain.\n\nThe environment is a dramatic, arid mountain landscape. Large rock formations dominate the background, with layered sedimentary structures visible in the cliff faces. The terrain is rocky and dusty, with a cloud of dust visible near the jump, indicating the dry nature of the environment.\n\nThe cyclist's movement is dynamic and skillful. They have launched off what appears to be a natural ramp in the rocky terrain, achieving significant air time. The bike is angled slightly upward, suggesting the rider is at the apex of their jump or just beginning to descend.\n\nThe lighting in the scene is bright and natural, likely during midday, casting strong shadows and highlighting the contours of the landscape. The sky is clear blue, adding to the sense of an arid, possibly desert-like environment.\n\nThis image captures the thrill and danger of extreme mountain biking, showcasing both the athlete's skill and the challenging, beautiful natural environment in which the sport takes place.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is skillfully riding a bicycle down a rocky, dirt hillside. The cyclist is in motion, traveling on a narrow path between large rocks and boulders. The surrounding environment appears to be a mixture of mountainous terrain and a rocky cliff. The rider displays impressive balance and control as they navigate through the challenging landscape. This captivating scene showcases the adventurous aspect of mountain biking and the rider's ability to adapt to unpredictable, rocky terrain.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the cyclist's action and position in the air.\n2. Detail the mountainous and rocky environment surrounding the cyclist.\n3. Mention the lighting and weather conditions visible in the image.",
