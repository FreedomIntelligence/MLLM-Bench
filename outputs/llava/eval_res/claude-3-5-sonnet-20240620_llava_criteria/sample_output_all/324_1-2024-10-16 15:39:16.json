    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat makes the image blurry?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is blurry because it was taken on a moving train, such as a subway train or a train passing down the tracks. The motion creates a sense of blurriness or visual uncertainty, as the train and its surroundings were not stationary during capture.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe blurriness in the image is caused by motion blur. The subway train is in motion, moving quickly through the station, which creates a blurred effect on the train and the passengers inside. This technique is often used in photography to convey a sense of speed and movement. The train appears as a streaked, elongated shape, while the stationary elements of the image (like the platform and signage) remain sharp and in focus. This contrast between the moving and stationary elements emphasizes the rapid transit nature of the subway system in Tokyo.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the blur is due to low pixel count.\n2. Assess whether motion contributes to the image's blurriness.\n3. Evaluate if focus issues are causing the blur in the image.",
