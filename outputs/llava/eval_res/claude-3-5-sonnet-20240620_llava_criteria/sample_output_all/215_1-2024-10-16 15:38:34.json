    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis chart strongly implies that global mean temperatures have been rising significantly over time, especially in recent decades. The key implications are:\n\n1. Global warming trend: The chart shows a clear upward trend in global mean temperature from the mid-20th century to 2023, with the steepest increase occurring from around 1980 onwards.\n\n2. Consensus among different datasets: Multiple temperature datasets (HadCRUT5, NOAAGlobalTemp, Kadow et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5) all show very similar trends, reinforcing the reliability of the warming signal.\n\n3. Acceleration of warming: The rate of temperature increase appears to be accelerating, with the curve becoming steeper in recent years.\n\n4. Departure from historical baseline: Current temperatures are significantly higher (around 1.2-1.4°C) than the 1850-1900 average, which is often used as a pre-industrial baseline.\n\n5. Potential climate change: The rapid and consistent increase in global mean temperature implies significant climate change is occurring, which could have wide-ranging environmental and societal impacts.\n\n6. Long-term data: The chart provides a long-term perspective (from 1850 to 2023), allowing for the observation of both short-term variability and long-term trends.\n\n7. Recent record temperatures: The sharp uptick at the end of the chart suggests that recent years (up to 2023) have been among the warmest on record.\n\nThis chart is a powerful visual representation of global warming trends and supports the scientific consensus on human-induced climate change.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
