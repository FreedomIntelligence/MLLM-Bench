    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify any cultural or traditional attire and elements present in the scene, and infer the type of ceremony or event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are individuals dressed in traditional African attire, particularly a man wearing a kilt and a woman in a colorful dress. They are standing around a table, which indicates a formal event or ceremony. The presence of a cell phone on the table might suggest that the event is being documented or that the attendees are using it for communication. The group of people is engaged in a specific activity, and their attire suggests that the event is culturally or traditionally based.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a scene that appears to be a traditional West African, likely Ghanaian, wedding ceremony or a part of wedding celebrations. Here are the cultural and traditional elements present:\n\n1. Kente cloth: The vibrant, colorful fabric with geometric patterns worn by two of the individuals is traditional Kente cloth, which originates from the Akan ethnic group of Ghana. It's often worn during important ceremonies.\n\n2. Traditional white attire: Two men are wearing white outfits that resemble traditional West African formal wear, often seen in ceremonial contexts.\n\n3. Bridal attire: One person is wearing what appears to be a silver, off-shoulder top with elaborate hair decorations, likely a bridal outfit blending traditional and modern styles.\n\n4. Jewelry: Gold jewelry is visible, which is common in West African ceremonies, especially weddings.\n\n5. Bouquet: A small bouquet of flowers is being held, typical in wedding ceremonies.\n\n6. Formal setting: The indoor setting with a wooden table suggests a formal ceremony or legal proceeding related to the wedding.\n\nBased on these elements, this scene likely depicts a part of a Ghanaian wedding ceremony, possibly the signing of the marriage certificate or a similar formal proceeding that's part of the wedding day events. The blend of traditional clothing (Kente cloth) with more modern bridal wear suggests a ceremony that honors cultural traditions while incorporating contemporary elements.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify attire indicating a wedding; prioritize bright-colored, festive garments and any headpieces.\n2. Describe elements like bouquets or ceremonial objects that suggest a wedding.\n3. Identify the presence of a marriage officer or a religious leader holding a book that suggest a wedding.",
