    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe exaggeration in the cat's expression is quite dramatic and contributes significantly to the meme's humor. In the \"Before Coffee\" image, the cat appears grumpy, with narrowed eyes and a slightly downturned mouth, embodying a stereotypical morning mood before caffeine. \n\nThe \"After Coffee\" image, however, shows an extreme contrast. The cat's eyes are comically wide open, almost bulging, and its mouth is open in what appears to be an excited or manic expression. The tongue is visible, and the overall look is one of intense alertness or even hysteria.\n\nThis hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor in several ways:\n\n1. Relatability: It exaggerates the common human experience of feeling sluggish before coffee and energized after, making it relatable but in an absurd, feline context.\n\n2. Contrast: The stark difference between the two expressions emphasizes the perceived transformative power of coffee, which is often joked about in popular culture.\n\n3. Anthropomorphism: By attributing such human-like reactions to a cat, it creates a humorous parallel between animal behavior and human coffee culture.\n\n4. Surprise element: The extreme change in expression is unexpected, especially for a cat, which adds to the comedic effect.\n\n5. Visual impact: The exaggerated features, particularly in the \"After Coffee\" image, are visually striking and immediately grab attention.\n\nThis hyperbolic representation of coffee's effects, portrayed through a cat's expressions, creates a humorous commentary on caffeine dependence and morning routines that many people find amusing and relatable.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
