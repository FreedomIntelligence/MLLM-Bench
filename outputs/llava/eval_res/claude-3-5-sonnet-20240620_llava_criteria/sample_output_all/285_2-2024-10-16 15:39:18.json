    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer from the image the occupation of the group of individuals.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, I can infer that the individuals are students. The setting appears to be a classroom, with educational posters visible on the walls and a whiteboard in the background. The group is gathered around a table with several small globes and a light, suggesting they are engaged in some kind of educational activity or experiment related to geography or earth science. Their casual clothing and the classroom environment strongly indicate that these are school students, likely in middle or high school, participating in a hands-on learning exercise.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the group of individuals appears to be students, as they are engaged in a science project involving experiments with light bulbs and globes. They are likely working together in a science classroom or a laboratory setting, which is a typical environment for students participating in educational activities and projects. The presence of multiple individuals working on the experiment suggests that they are collaborating on a shared goal or task, commonly associated with educational or research-oriented groups.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer aligns with the reference occupation: Students.\n2. Justify the occupation inference based on elements in the image, such as textbooks, the globe, the bulb simulating the sun.",
