    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, classify the event taking place and determine the subject of the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe event taking place is a parade, with the subject being a giant inflatable Spider-Man balloon. The balloon is placed on a float, and it appears to be the main attraction of the parade. The crowd of people is gathered around the street to witness this spectacle, making the event lively and enjoyable. Parades often feature unique and eye-catching floats, and this Spider-Man balloon certainly seems to be the center of attention in this particular event.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, I can classify this event as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The subject of the event is the large Spider-Man balloon float.\n\nThe image shows a massive inflatable Spider-Man character floating above a crowded city street, which is characteristic of the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade held annually in New York City. The parade is known for its large character balloons, and Spider-Man is a recurring favorite.\n\nThe urban setting with tall buildings, advertisements (like Samsung and Coca-Cola signs visible), and the dense crowd below further confirm this is taking place in New York City's Times Square area, a part of the traditional parade route.\n\nBelow the Spider-Man balloon, we can see other parade elements, including what appears to be handlers in matching outfits controlling the balloon, and possibly other floats or balloons (there's a glimpse of what might be an apple-shaped balloon).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- Event: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\n- Subject: Spider-Man balloon float\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as a parade, noting the large character balloon and crowd.\n2. Recognize the subject as a character from popular culture.\n3. Describe the atmosphere indicative of a celebratory event.",
