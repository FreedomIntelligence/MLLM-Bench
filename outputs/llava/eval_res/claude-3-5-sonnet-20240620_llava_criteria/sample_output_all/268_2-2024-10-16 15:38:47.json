    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it appears that this circuit board has suffered from severe liquid damage. The most notable evidence of this is the presence of what looks like crystallized or dried liquid residue on the board, particularly visible in the center of the image. This residue has formed around and on top of various components, creating a crusty, irregular surface.\n\nLiquid damage can cause several issues that would render a circuit board unusable:\n\n1. Short circuits: The liquid can create conductive paths between components that shouldn't be connected, causing short circuits.\n\n2. Corrosion: Depending on the type of liquid, it can cause corrosion of the metal components and traces on the board.\n\n3. Component damage: Some electronic components are sensitive to moisture and can be permanently damaged when exposed to liquids.\n\n4. Residue: As the liquid evaporates, it can leave behind conductive or insulating residues that interfere with the board's normal operation.\n\n5. Delamination: In some cases, liquid exposure can cause the layers of the circuit board to separate.\n\nThe extent of the visible residue suggests that this board was likely exposed to a significant amount of liquid, which would make it highly unlikely to function properly without extensive cleaning and potentially component replacement. In many cases, such severe liquid damage renders a circuit board beyond economical repair.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
