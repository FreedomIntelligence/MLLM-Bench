    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the relationship between the two individuals appears to be professional. They are seated at a table in what looks like an office or meeting room, with a large window visible in the background. Both are dressed in business attire - the person on the left in a beige blazer and the person on the right in a gray suit and tie.\n\nThe person on the left is gesturing while speaking, suggesting they are explaining something or making a point. The person on the right is holding a pen and has a notebook in front of them, indicating they may be taking notes or preparing to write something down.\n\nGiven this setting and their interactions, their relationship could be:\n\n1. Colleagues in a meeting or discussion\n2. A manager and employee in a performance review or planning session\n3. An interviewer and job candidate\n4. A client and consultant discussing a project\n5. Business partners in a strategy meeting\n\nWithout more context, it's impossible to determine their exact relationship, but the image strongly suggests a professional business interaction between two individuals in a work environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the person holding the pen is likely the interviewer, while the person speaking to him is the interviewee. The interviewee is sitting in front of the interviewer, and the interviewer has a book open, which suggests that he might be taking notes or referring to some information during the conversation. The interaction between them takes place on a table, reinforcing the perception that this is a professional setting and an interview context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional relationship based on attire, setting, and body language.\n2. Assess dialogue cues suggesting hierarchy, cooperation, or advisory roles.",
