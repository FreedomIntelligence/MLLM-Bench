    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19. It's a rapid antigen test, as indicated by the \"COVID-19 Ag\" label on the device.\n\nRegarding the two lines on the test kit:\n\n1. The top line, marked with a \"C\" (which stands for \"Control\"), shows a pink/red line. This indicates that the test is working properly and the result is valid.\n\n2. The bottom line, marked with an \"S\" (which stands for \"Sample\" or \"Test\"), does not show any visible line.\n\nThe interpretation of these results is that this is a negative test for COVID-19. A single line at the \"C\" marker typically indicates a negative result, meaning the test did not detect COVID-19 antigens in the sample. If there were two lines (both at \"C\" and \"S\"), it would indicate a positive result.\n\nIt's important to note that while these rapid tests are useful, they are not 100% accurate and results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical information and more sensitive tests if necessary.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
