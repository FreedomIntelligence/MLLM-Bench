    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze if the people in the image hold a ethical demand.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the people in this image are clearly making an ethical demand. The primary focus of their protest is ending racism, which is fundamentally an ethical issue.\n\nThe signs visible in the image carry strong ethical messages:\n\n1. \"END RACISM\" - This is a direct ethical demand to stop discriminatory practices and beliefs based on race.\n\n2. \"RACISM IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY\" - This statement frames racism as not just unethical, but as a severe violation of human rights and dignity.\n\nThe protesters appear to be at a nighttime demonstration, passionately calling out and holding their signs high. Their facial expressions and body language suggest they are actively engaged in making their voices heard on this ethical issue.\n\nThe diversity of the protesters visible in the image (including a woman wearing a hijab) underscores the universal nature of their ethical demand - that racism affects and should concern people from all backgrounds.\n\nBy protesting against racism, these individuals are advocating for equality, justice, and human dignity - all of which are core ethical principles. Their demand is not just political or social, but fundamentally rooted in ethics and morality.\n\nIn conclusion, this image clearly depicts people making a strong, unambiguous ethical demand for the end of racism and the recognition of its harm to humanity.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the people in the image are holding up signs with political demands, which suggests that they are advocating for a particular cause or ethical position. Given the variety of signs they are holding, it indicates that they are representing diverse opinions or concerns, which is typically found in protests or demonstrations. By participating in such events, the individuals are voicing their opinions and raising awareness about the issues they consider important, with the intention of influencing societal change, policy-making, or public opinion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the image depicts a demand for ethical treatment or social justice.\n2. Evaluate the presence of signs or expressions that convey an ethical stance.\n3. Determine the context of the demand, such as anti-racism or human rights.",
