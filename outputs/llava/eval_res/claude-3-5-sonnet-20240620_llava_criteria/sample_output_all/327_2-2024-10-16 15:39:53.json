    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happens to the images from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom left to right, the image shows a before and after comparison of photo editing or enhancement. The left image appears to be the original photograph, while the right image is the edited version. \n\nThe main changes from left to right are:\n\n1. Improved brightness and contrast: The right image has better overall lighting, with the sky appearing brighter and clearer.\n\n2. Color correction: The colors in the right image are more vibrant and balanced, especially noticeable in the blue tones of the sky.\n\n3. Enhanced details: The buildings and structures in the right image appear sharper and more defined.\n\n4. Adjusted exposure: The sun's glare in the center of the image is slightly reduced, allowing for better visibility of the surrounding architecture.\n\n5. Improved shadows and highlights: The right image shows better definition in both the shadowed areas and the highlights, creating more depth in the scene.\n\nThe overall effect is a more polished and visually appealing image on the right, while maintaining the original composition and architectural elements of the cityscape.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs the two images travel from left to right, the image loses contrast, giving it a silhouette appearance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in exposure, contrast, and color balance between images.\n2. Assess sharpness, noise, and detail preservation in both images.\n3. Evaluate dynamic range, highlighting shadow and highlight detail retention.",
