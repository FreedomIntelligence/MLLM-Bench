    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the intensity of the emotion on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and justify the assessment based on visual cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe intensity of the emotion displayed in this image can be assessed as severe.\n\nJustification based on visual cues:\n\n1. Eyes: The character's eyes are narrowed and angled downwards, creating a strong furrowed brow effect. The pupils are small and focused, indicating intense concentration or anger.\n\n2. Mouth: The mouth is drawn into a tight, teeth-baring grimace. The teeth are clearly visible and clenched, suggesting extreme tension or aggression.\n\n3. Overall facial expression: The combination of the narrowed eyes and grimacing mouth creates a classic expression of intense anger or rage.\n\n4. Color: The character's bright red color further emphasizes the intensity of the emotion, as red is often associated with anger and strong emotions.\n\n5. Body language: Although we can only see the upper body, the character appears tense and rigid, which aligns with the severe facial expression.\n\n6. Contrast: The severe expression is made more striking by the contrast with the formal office attire (shirt, tie, and belt), suggesting a barely contained emotional state in a professional setting.\n\nThe exaggerated features of this animated character are designed to convey a very strong, almost comical level of anger or frustration, pushing the emotion to its extreme. This makes the intensity of the emotion unmistakably severe.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe intensity of the emotion on this angry face can be assessed as severe. The visual cues indicating this level of intensity include the character's wide-opened eyes, furrowed brow, and tightly clenched teeth as they make a face of anger and frustration. The red color of the character's face also contributes to the intensity of the expression, as red is often associated with strong emotions or danger. Overall, these visual cues give the impression of a highly intense and severe emotional state.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the identified emotion matches the character's facial expression (e.g., angry, frustrated).\n2. Rate the intensity of the emotion as moderate, or severe.",
