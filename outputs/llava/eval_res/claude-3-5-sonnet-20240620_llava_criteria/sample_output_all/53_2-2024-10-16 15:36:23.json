    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe landmark in this image is the Sydney Opera House, an iconic example of expressionist modern architecture. \n\nThe architectural style is characterized by its distinctive roof design, featuring a series of large precast concrete \"shells\" or \"sails\" that form the structure's roof. This bold, sculptural approach to architecture was revolutionary when the building was designed in the 1950s and completed in 1973.\n\nThe architect, Jørn Utzon, conceived a design that was both highly original and deeply rooted in its harbor-side setting. The concept appears to draw inspiration from natural forms and maritime imagery, with the roof shells reminiscent of billowing sails or seashells.\n\nThe design embraces organic shapes and forms, breaking away from traditional rectangular structures. This approach aligns with the broader modernist movement's aim to challenge conventional architectural norms.\n\nIn the image, we see the Opera House illuminated at night with a striking red pattern projected onto its white shells, showcasing how the building's unique form lends itself to artistic light displays. This adaptability for visual arts was likely part of the architect's vision for a multi-functional, expressive structure.\n\nThe reflection of the building in the harbor waters and the dramatic sunset sky emphasize how the architect integrated the structure with its environment, making it a harmonious yet bold addition to the Sydney skyline.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
