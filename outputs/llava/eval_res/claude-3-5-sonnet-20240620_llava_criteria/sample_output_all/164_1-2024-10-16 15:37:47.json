    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven an image of an e-mail, determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe author's primary intention behind sending the email is likely to inform the recipient about three urgent updates, possibly related to politics or a specific event. The email includes a smiling man wearing a blue shirt, suggesting that the recipient might be familiar with the person or the situation described in the email. The presence of a flag in the image and the name \"Mike Johnson\" may provide additional context or information about the updates the recipient should be aware of.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary intention behind this email appears to be fundraising and mobilizing support for a political cause. The author, identified as Mike Johnson, is sharing three \"urgent updates\" that seem designed to create a sense of urgency and importance around current political events. \n\nThe content focuses on upcoming special elections, fundraising success of the Democratic party, and the current balance of power in the House of Representatives. The tone and framing of these updates suggest that the author is likely appealing to supporters of the Republican party, as the message implies concern about Democratic success and control.\n\nBy presenting these updates as \"urgent\" and framing them in a way that suggests potential negative outcomes (from the author's perspective), the email seems intended to motivate readers to take action - likely in the form of donations or other support for the opposing political party.\n\nThe presence of \"Unsubscribe | Mark as Junk\" options at the top of the email further indicates that this is likely a mass communication sent to a mailing list, consistent with political fundraising and mobilization efforts.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the email's purpose is to inform, request action, or another intention.\n2. Assess how the email's content supports the identified primary intention.\n3. Determine the relevance of updates mentioned to the email's primary intention.",
