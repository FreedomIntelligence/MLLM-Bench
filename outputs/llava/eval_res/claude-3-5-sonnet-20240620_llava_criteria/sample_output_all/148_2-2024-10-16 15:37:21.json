    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in this image comes from several elements working together:\n\n1. The word \"MONDAYS...\" at the top of the image, which immediately sets up the context of the start of a workweek, often associated with feelings of tiredness or reluctance.\n\n2. The image of a cat in an unusual and somewhat comical sleeping position. The cat is curled up with its face completely hidden, giving the impression of wanting to shut out the world.\n\n3. The contrast between the typical human reaction to Mondays and the cat's behavior. While humans have to get up and go to work, the cat is able to continue sleeping in what appears to be a very comfortable and carefree manner.\n\n4. The implication that even cats, which are known for sleeping a lot, find Mondays particularly challenging or unpleasant.\n\n5. The relatable nature of the joke. Many people feel a sense of dread or tiredness on Monday mornings and wish they could stay in bed, just like the cat in the image.\n\nThe humor arises from the anthropomorphization of the cat's behavior, attributing human-like feelings about Mondays to an animal that doesn't actually have a concept of weekdays. This creates a humorous and relatable scenario that resonates with many people's experiences and feelings about the beginning of the work week.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
