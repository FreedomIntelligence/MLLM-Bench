    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat would be the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image? The image size is 1300*1300\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n[0.41, 0.05, 0.76, 0.28]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image provided and the given dimensions of 1300x1300 pixels, I'll estimate the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry. Please note that these are approximate values:\n\nTop-left corner (x, y): (500, 100)\nBottom-right corner (x, y): (800, 400)\n\nSo the bounding box coordinates would be:\n[500, 100, 800, 400]\n\nThis estimation takes into account the strawberry's position at the top of the dessert, its size relative to the overall image, and its shape. The strawberry occupies roughly the upper middle portion of the image, sitting on top of what appears to be whipped cream on a rolled pastry or cake.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of the strawberry's bounding box coordinates.\n2. Bounding box should tightly enclose the entire strawberry.\n3. Coordinates must be accurate relative to the image's dimensions.",
