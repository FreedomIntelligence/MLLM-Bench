    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the floor plan provided in the image, I can assess the design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas:\n\nPrivacy for Bedrooms:\n1. The bedrooms are well-positioned for privacy, as they are located away from the main living areas.\n2. The master bedroom is separated from the other two bedrooms, providing additional privacy.\n3. Each bedroom has its own dedicated bathroom, which enhances privacy for the occupants.\n4. The bedrooms are not directly accessible from the main entrance, which adds an extra layer of privacy.\n\nAccessibility to Communal Areas:\n1. The living room is centrally located, making it easily accessible from all bedrooms and other areas of the house.\n2. The kitchen and dining area are open to each other and adjacent to the living room, creating a fluid and accessible communal space.\n3. The prayer room is conveniently located near the living area, making it easily accessible for all household members.\n4. The store room is placed near the kitchen, which is practical for accessing household supplies.\n\nOverall, the floor plan demonstrates a good balance between privacy for personal spaces and accessibility to communal areas. The bedrooms are tucked away from the main living spaces, while the central positioning of the living room, kitchen, and dining area promotes easy interaction and movement between these shared spaces.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
