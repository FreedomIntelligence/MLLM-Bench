    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the foods on the table detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a plate of various appetizers or snacks, likely from an Asian-inspired restaurant or eatery. Here's a detailed description of the foods on the table:\n\n1. Fried chicken wings: There are several pieces of golden-brown, crispy-looking chicken wings on the plate. They appear to be glazed or coated with a sauce, giving them a shiny appearance.\n\n2. Fried calamari or squid: A portion of what looks like battered and deep-fried calamari rings or squid pieces is visible. They have a light golden color.\n\n3. Crispy wonton or dumpling skins: Two pieces of what appear to be fried wonton or dumpling skins are standing up on the plate. They are golden and crispy-looking.\n\n4. Dipping sauces: There are two small dishes with sauces:\n   - A creamy yellow sauce, possibly a mustard or curry-based sauce\n   - A reddish-brown spice mix or dry rub, perhaps for the chicken wings\n\n5. Garnish: A sprig of fresh parsley or cilantro is placed on the plate for decoration and added flavor.\n\n6. Plush toy: Next to the plate is a small, egg-shaped plush toy with an orange beak, likely representing a character or mascot associated with the restaurant.\n\nThe food is served on a white plate that has some text printed on it, suggesting it might be branded tableware from the establishment. The plate is placed on what appears to be a wooden table or surface.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe table features a plate full of food, which includes meat, bread, greens, and a salad. There are several pieces of bread, some of which are of different sizes. A bowl of sauce is also present on the table. Additionally, there's a donut on the table, slightly separated from the main plate of food.\n\nIn the background, a stuffed teddy bear is sitting next to the plate. The dining table occupies most of the scene, setting a casual atmosphere for enjoying the meal.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe all visible food items, including chicken wings and chili powder.\n2. Mention textures or colors where relevant to the description of the foods.",
