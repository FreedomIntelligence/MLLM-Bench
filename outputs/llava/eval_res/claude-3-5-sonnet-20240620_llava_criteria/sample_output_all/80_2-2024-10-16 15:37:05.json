    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the damage of the road in the image, what should be done to reconstruct the road?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the road has suffered severe damage with a large section completely washed away, creating a deep chasm across the roadway. To reconstruct this road, several steps would need to be taken:\n\n1. Assessment: A thorough evaluation of the extent of the damage, including soil stability and underlying structures.\n\n2. Drainage improvement: Install proper drainage systems to prevent future water damage, as this appears to be caused by water erosion.\n\n3. Soil stabilization: The surrounding soil needs to be reinforced and compacted to provide a stable foundation.\n\n4. Fill the gap: The chasm needs to be filled with appropriate materials, likely starting with large rocks or rubble, followed by smaller gravel and soil, compacting each layer.\n\n5. Road base reconstruction: Rebuild the road base with proper materials and compaction.\n\n6. Paving: Apply new asphalt or concrete to match the existing road surface.\n\n7. Guard rails: Install guard rails or barriers along the sides of the reconstructed section for safety.\n\n8. Road markings: Repaint road markings to ensure proper traffic flow.\n\n9. Environmental considerations: Implement erosion control measures and replant vegetation where necessary to prevent future erosion.\n\nThis reconstruction process would require heavy machinery, skilled workers, and careful engineering to ensure the new road section is stable and can withstand future weather events. The work would also need to be coordinated with local authorities to manage traffic and ensure safety during the reconstruction process.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nGiven the image where a person is standing near a road with a large hole in it, and a green truck driving by, it is evident that the road has experienced significant damage. To reconstruct the road, the following steps should be considered:\n\n1. Assess the damage: A thorough inspection of the damaged area should be conducted to understand the extent of the damage and identify any underlying issues, such as soil instability, infrastructure damage, or erosion.\n\n2. Develop a repair plan: Based on the assessment, a repair plan should be developed, taking into account factors such as budget, resources, and timelines. This plan should include specific repair or replacement strategies for the damaged infrastructure.\n\n3. Procure necessary materials and equipment: Once the repair plan is in place, the required materials and equipment should be acquired. This may include concrete, asphalt, steel, and other construction materials, as well as specialized equipment such as excavators, bulldozers, and trucks.\n\n4. Allocate resources: Depending on the repair plan, appropriate personnel and resources must be allocated to the project. This could include hiring experienced contractors, engineers, and construction workers to ensure efficient and effective reconstruction.\n\n5. Perform repairs: The actual repair work should be carried out, following the repair plan and adhering to safety protocols. This process may involve excavating damaged areas, repairing or replacing damaged infrastructure, and securing the reconstructed road to prevent future damage.\n\n6. Monitor progress and completion: Throughout the reconstructive process, the progress should be closely monitored to ensure that the work is completed according to the planned timeline and budget. Once the road is reconstructed, regular maintenance checks should be implemented to prevent future damage.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the extent of road damage: collapsed sections, cracks, and any visible structural failures.\n2. Suggest reconstruction steps: debris removal, ground stabilization, repaving, or rerouting.\n3. Consider safety and traffic control measures for the reconstruction process.",
