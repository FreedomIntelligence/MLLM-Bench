    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the texture of the skin of fruits in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the apple has a smooth, glossy skin, while the orange has a rough, slightly textured skin.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two fruits with distinctly different skin textures:\n\n1. Apple (green fruit on the left):\nThe apple has a smooth, waxy-looking skin. Its surface appears even and glossy, with a slight sheen visible in the lighting. There are very subtle variations in color and tiny imperfections that give it a natural look, but overall the texture is uniform and sleek.\n\n2. Orange (orange fruit on the right):\nIn contrast, the orange has a much more textured skin. Its surface is visibly dimpled and pitted, giving it a rough appearance. This texture is often described as \"pebbled\" or \"bumpy.\" The skin has a matte finish rather than a glossy one, and the multitude of tiny indentations create a complex pattern of light and shadow across its surface.\n\nThe difference in texture between these two fruits is quite stark. While the apple's skin appears almost polished and flat, the orange's skin is notably irregular and rough to the eye. This textural contrast is one of the key visual differences between these two types of fruit, alongside their distinct colors and shapes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention apple's smooth, glossy skin and orange's dimpled, pebbled texture.",
