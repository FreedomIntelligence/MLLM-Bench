    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is a table, and you need to implement data visualization based on the data in the table, in order to present the data in the table in the best way.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the image features a table with a list of different states in India, one potential data visualization approach is to create a bar chart or a line graph that displays the population of each state over time. This can help showcase changes in population growth and trends across the states, and highlight any particularly fast-growing or slow-growing areas.\n\nTo implement this approach, you can use a data visualization tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a specialized data visualization application. Start by sorting the table by the population column or selecting the columns that show the population figures for each state. Then, create a bar chart or a line graph with the population data on the vertical axis and the state names on the horizontal axis.\n\nFurthermore, you can consider adding color-coding to the chart based on the state's region, such as North, South, East, or West, to make it easier to identify trends within specific geographic areas. Finally, you can add labels and legends to the chart for better clarity and understanding of the data. With these visualization techniques, you can effectively present the data in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo best visualize the data in this table, I would recommend using a combination of visualization techniques:\n\n1. Stacked Area Chart:\n   This would be the primary visualization, showing the share of taxes for each state over time. The x-axis would represent the six Finance Commission periods, and the y-axis would show the percentage share. Each state would be represented by a different colored area, stacked on top of each other. This would allow for easy comparison of states' shares over time and how they relate to each other.\n\n2. Small Multiples Line Charts:\n   Create a grid of small line charts, one for each state. This would allow for a detailed view of how each state's share has changed over time, making it easy to spot trends for individual states.\n\n3. Heatmap:\n   Convert the table into a heatmap, with states on the y-axis and Finance Commission periods on the x-axis. Color intensity would represent the percentage share, allowing for quick identification of high and low values across states and time periods.\n\n4. Grouped Bar Chart:\n   For the top 5-10 states (by average share), create a grouped bar chart. Each group would represent a state, with six bars showing the share for each Finance Commission period. This would allow for easy comparison of the largest contributors over time.\n\n5. Treemap:\n   Create a treemap for each Finance Commission period, with the size of each rectangle representing the state's share. This would provide a quick visual of how the shares are distributed among states at any given time period.\n\n6. Interactive Dashboard:\n   Combine these visualizations into an interactive dashboard where users can switch between different views, filter states, or zoom in on specific time periods.\n\nThese visualizations would help to highlight trends, compare states, and show the overall distribution of tax shares over time, making the data more accessible and easier to interpret than the raw table.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Visualize data trends across Finance Commissions for multiple states.\n2. Highlight top three states with the highest percentage share changes.\n3. Ensure visualization clarity for comparison between states and years.",
