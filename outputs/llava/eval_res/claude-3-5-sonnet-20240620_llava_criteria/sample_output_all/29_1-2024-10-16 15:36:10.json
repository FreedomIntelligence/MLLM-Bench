    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the activity taking place, why are they pulling the rope?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a group of people, including children and teenagers, standing on a field of grass and pulling a rope. This activity seems to be an organized team-building event or an organized game where participants need to work together to achieve a common goal. The exact purpose of pulling the rope is unclear; it could be related to a tug-of-war, an obstacle course, or a symbolic gesture. It is evident that the activity requires cooperation and coordination among the participants, which aims to foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding among the team members.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe activity taking place in this image is a game of tug-of-war. A group of people, who appear to be students or young individuals, are lined up on a grassy area in front of what looks like a school building. They are pulling on an unseen rope in a classic tug-of-war formation.\n\nTug-of-war is a competitive game where two teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal of pulling the other team towards them and across a central line. It's often played as a team-building exercise, during field days at schools, or as a fun recreational activity.\n\nThe participants are pulling the rope as part of this game, trying to use their collective strength to overpower the opposing team (which is not visible in this image). This activity promotes teamwork, physical strength, and friendly competition. It's a common outdoor activity that can be enjoyed by people of various ages and is often seen in school or community events.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity as tug-of-war.\n2. Confirm the action involves pulling a rope.\n3. Explain the reason for pulling the rope is a competitive effort.",
