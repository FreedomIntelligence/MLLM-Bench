    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a single ginger cat lying on a concrete surface in an urban environment. The cat has a sleek, orange-colored coat and is stretched out in a relaxed pose. Its eyes are open and alert, looking directly at the camera. The cat's ears are perked up, suggesting it's attentive to its surroundings.\n\nThe environment appears to be the exterior of a modern building, likely an institutional or office structure. In the background, we can see a multi-story building with large windows and a distinctive architectural style. The building has a light-colored facade with horizontal louvers or slats on the upper level, possibly for sun shading or aesthetic purposes.\n\nThe cat is positioned near a gray wall or column, which contrasts with its orange fur. The ground where the cat is lying seems to be a concrete walkway or patio area. The lighting suggests it's daytime, with natural sunlight casting shadows and highlighting the cat's fur.\n\nIn the lower part of the building visible in the background, there appear to be some glass doors or windows, and inside, some objects that might be bulletin boards or signs can be faintly seen.\n\nOverall, the image presents a juxtaposition of nature and urban architecture, with the cat seeming quite at home in this built environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
