    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nwhat is the cause of the traffic jam in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe traffic jam in the image is caused by a multi-vehicle accident, resulting in an overturned car on the side of the street.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe cause of the traffic jam in the image appears to be a car accident. There's a white car that seems to have crashed into the road barrier on the left side of the road. The car is positioned sideways, blocking part of the road. A police vehicle is present at the scene, and there's a police officer standing in the road, likely managing traffic and the accident situation. This obstruction is causing other vehicles to slow down and create a backup, resulting in the traffic jam visible in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify traffic accident as the cause of the jam.\n2. Mention visible collision damage or road blockage.\n3. Describe the presence of emergency services or responders.",
