    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in this picture is where the wooden desk with the hutch is currently placed, between the two windows. This location is ideal for several reasons:\n\n1. Natural light: The desk is positioned between two windows, which provides ample natural light. Good lighting is essential for productivity and eye comfort in an office setting.\n\n2. Wall space: The desk is against a wall, which allows for efficient use of space and the possibility to hang organizational tools or inspirational items above the workspace.\n\n3. Power access: Given the presence of electronic items on the desk (like the boombox), it's likely that there are power outlets nearby, which is crucial for office equipment.\n\n4. Size and storage: The desk itself appears to be a good size for office work, with a hutch that provides additional storage space for books, supplies, and equipment.\n\n5. Central location: The desk is centrally located in the room, making it easily accessible and allowing for a good flow of movement around the space.\n\n6. Privacy: While the windows provide light, they also have blinds, allowing for privacy when needed.\n\nThis setup already resembles a functional home office or study area, making it the most logical choice for an office space within this room.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
