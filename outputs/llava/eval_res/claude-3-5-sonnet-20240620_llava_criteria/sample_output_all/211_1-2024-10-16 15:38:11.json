    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich parts of the map have the greatest humidity?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the map, the areas with the highest humidity levels are located around the eastern part of China.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the humidity map of China shown in the image, the parts with the greatest humidity are the darkest blue regions, which correspond to a humidity range of 75-82 according to the legend. These areas of highest humidity are primarily located in:\n\n1. The southeastern coastal regions\n2. Parts of south-central China\n3. A northeastern region\n\nThe map shows a general trend of increasing humidity from northwest to southeast, with the northwestern and western parts of China having the lowest humidity levels (shown in white or very light blue), and the southern and eastern regions having progressively higher humidity levels (shown in darker shades of blue).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the area with the darkest shade representing the highest humidity range.\n2. Reference the legend to confirm the highest humidity value.\n3.
