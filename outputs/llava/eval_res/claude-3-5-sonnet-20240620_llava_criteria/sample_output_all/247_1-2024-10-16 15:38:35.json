    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues, estimate the approximate height of the woman.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman is likely approximately 5.5 feet tall or shorter, as she is described as a \"little woman\" and is standing below both the large man and the large person in a jacket. Her height is in contrast to the taller individuals present in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the visual cues in the image, the woman appears to be significantly shorter than the two men standing beside her. Given that the average height of adult men is typically around 5'9\" to 5'10\" (175-178 cm), and these men seem to be quite tall, possibly athletes, they could be 6'3\" (190 cm) or taller.\n\nThe woman's head reaches approximately to the chest level of the men. Considering this proportion, we can estimate that she is likely around 5'2\" to 5'4\" (157-163 cm) tall. This would put her at a height that's noticeably shorter than average male height, but within a typical range for adult women.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just an estimate based on the visual information provided in the image, and without precise measurements or known reference points, it's impossible to determine her exact height.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes estimated height of woman using visual comparison with reference heights.\n2. Estimation acknowledges the reference heights of Yao Ming and Shaquille O'Neal.",
