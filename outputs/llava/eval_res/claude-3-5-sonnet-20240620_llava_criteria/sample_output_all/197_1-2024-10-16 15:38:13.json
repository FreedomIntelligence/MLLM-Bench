    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a small, circular wound on what appears to be the palm of a hand. The wound looks like a blister that has opened or popped, revealing raw, reddish skin underneath. The surrounding skin appears slightly raised and irritated.\n\nHere's some advice for dealing with this type of wound:\n\n1. Clean the area gently with mild soap and water to prevent infection.\n\n2. Apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound to help prevent infection and promote healing.\n\n3. Cover the wound with a sterile adhesive bandage to keep it clean and protected.\n\n4. Change the bandage daily or whenever it gets wet or dirty.\n\n5. Avoid further irritation to the area by refraining from activities that put pressure on the wound.\n\n6. Monitor the wound for signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or pus. If these occur, consult a healthcare professional.\n\n7. Allow the wound to heal naturally. Don't peel off any remaining skin from the blister as it can protect the healing area underneath.\n\n8. If the wound is painful, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers as directed.\n\n9. Keep the area dry when possible to promote healing.\n\nIf the wound doesn't show signs of improvement within a few days or if you have any concerns, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
