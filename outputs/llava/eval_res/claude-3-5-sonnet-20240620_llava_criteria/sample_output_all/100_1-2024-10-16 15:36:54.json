    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify any animal other than sheep in the image. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere is an animal other than sheep in the image. It is a cat standing next to a sheep.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, among the many sheep, there is a wolf hiding. The wolf's head can be seen peeking out from between the sheep, with its distinctive gray coloration and pointed ears contrasting with the white, fluffy sheep surrounding it. This appears to be a visual representation of the idiom \"a wolf in sheep's clothing,\" illustrating how a predator or dangerous entity might try to blend in with a harmless group.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm presence of a wolf among sheep.",
