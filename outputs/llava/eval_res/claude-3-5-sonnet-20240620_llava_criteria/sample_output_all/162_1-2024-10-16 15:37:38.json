    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe Daily Mail's front page uses highly emotive language in its headlines, which can have a significant impact on readers' perceptions and emotions. Let's analyze the key elements:\n\n1. \"As judge brands teacher's murderer 'evil', hear the full heart-rending story on our award-winning podcast\"\n   - Emotive words: \"evil\", \"heart-rending\"\n   - Impact: These words evoke strong emotions of anger and sadness, potentially drawing readers in through an emotional appeal.\n\n2. \"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\"\n   - This headline uses a dramatic, confrontational tone.\n   - Impact: It creates a sense of unity and defiance, potentially rallying readers to a cause or viewpoint.\n\n3. \"Tory Right's warning to Rishi amid fears he's thinking of sacking Home Secretary\"\n   - Words like \"warning\" and \"fears\" create tension and urgency.\n   - Impact: This language can heighten readers' sense of political drama and conflict.\n\n4. The use of \"THE TRIAL\" in bold, capitalized letters\n   - Impact: Emphasizes the significance and drama of the event being reported.\n\n5. Promotion of their podcast as \"award-winning\"\n   - Impact: Attempts to build credibility and attract listeners through self-promotion.\n\nThe overall impact of this emotive language can be:\n1. Heightened emotional engagement from readers\n2. Potential to sway opinions or reinforce existing beliefs\n3. Increased likelihood of readers seeking more information or listening to the podcast\n4. Risk of sensationalizing news events\n5. Possible polarization of readers' views on the issues presented\n\nIt's important to note that such emotive language in headlines is a common tabloid technique designed to grab attention and sell newspapers, but it can also lead to biased or sensationalized reporting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotive language in headlines and specify its emotional tone (e.g., \"evil\", \"heart-rending\").\n2. Explain how the chosen language could influence readers' emotions or perceptions.",
