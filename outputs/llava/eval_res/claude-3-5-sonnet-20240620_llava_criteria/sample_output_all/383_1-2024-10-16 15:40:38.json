    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the skateboarder is currently mid-air, performing a high aerial trick over a complex skate park with multiple bowls and ramps. Given the height and position of the skater, the most likely next move would be landing back into one of the curved surfaces of the skate park.\n\nThe skater will need to adjust their body position and board angle to align with the curve of the landing surface. They'll likely aim to land on the transition (curved part) of the bowl or ramp to absorb the impact and maintain momentum.\n\nAs for the risk assessment:\n\n1. High impact landing: The skater is at a considerable height, which means the landing will involve significant force. This increases the risk of injury if not executed properly.\n\n2. Precision required: Landing accurately on a curved surface requires great skill and timing. A slight miscalculation could result in a fall.\n\n3. Hard surface: The skate park appears to be made of concrete, which offers no cushioning in case of a fall.\n\n4. Complex terrain: The multiple curves and transitions in the park add to the difficulty of choosing and executing a safe landing.\n\n5. Momentum management: The skater will need to control their speed upon landing to avoid losing balance or overshooting their intended path.\n\nOverall, this trick carries a high level of risk due to the height, speed, and complexity involved. However, it's important to note that skilled skateboarders train extensively to perform such maneuvers as safely as possible. Proper protective gear (though not visible in this image) would also help mitigate some of the risks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
