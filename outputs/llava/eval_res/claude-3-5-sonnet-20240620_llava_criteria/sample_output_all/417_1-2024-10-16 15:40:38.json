    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease identify and name each visible component of the watch mechanism, such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nInside the watch mechanism, we can see various components such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates. The gears are metal parts with teeth that help transfer power from one component to another. The jewels are usually made of a precious metal and are used to reduce friction between gears, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. The spring is a vital component that provides the power required to keep the watch running. Lastly, the plates are the main structural components of the watch movement, which help hold all the components together and guide their movements. These components work together to make the watch tick and keep accurate time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image shows the intricate inner workings of a mechanical watch movement. Here are the visible components I can identify:\n\n1. Gears (Wheels): Multiple brass-colored gears of various sizes are visible throughout the mechanism.\n\n2. Jewels: Small red and purple dots visible in several places are jewel bearings, used to reduce friction.\n\n3. Plates: The silver-colored metal forming the base and structure of the movement.\n\n4. Bridge: The shaped metal pieces that hold various components in place.\n\n5. Balance wheel: The circular component visible at the bottom, used for timekeeping regulation.\n\n6. Hairspring: The thin spiral spring attached to the balance wheel.\n\n7. Escape wheel: A star-shaped gear, part of the escapement mechanism.\n\n8. Mainspring barrel: The large circular component, typically housing the mainspring.\n\n9. Screws: Multiple small screws are visible, holding various parts together.\n\n10. Lever: Part of the escapement mechanism, usually near the balance wheel.\n\n11. Regulator: The component with markings (S and F) near the balance wheel, used for fine-tuning.\n\n12. Winding stem: The protruding piece on the right side of the movement.\n\n13. Ratchet wheel: A gear with angled teeth, often part of the winding mechanism.\n\nThis movement appears to be from a chronograph watch, given its complexity and number of components. The level of detail and finishing suggests it's a high-quality movement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all visible components like gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n2. Accurately name each component based on watchmaking terminology.\n3. Ensure descriptions are clear and correspond to the specific parts in the image.",
