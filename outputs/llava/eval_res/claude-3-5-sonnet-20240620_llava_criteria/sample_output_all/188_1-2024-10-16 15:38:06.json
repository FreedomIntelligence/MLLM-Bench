    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the maximum number of people who belong to the same team in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the picture, there are two men wearing blue colors who belong to the same team.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the maximum number of people who belong to the same team appears to be 6. The image shows a soccer match in progress, and there are two teams visible on the field. One team is wearing white jerseys, and there are 6 players from this team visible in the image. The other team has blue jerseys, but fewer players from this team can be seen. There's also a player in a red jersey who appears to be the goalkeeper, and a referee in yellow. So the largest group of players from a single team that can be counted in this picture is 6, which is the team in white.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the maximum number of people in the same team: 7.",
