Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the woman doing? Why does she hold a microphone?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman is singing with her mouth wide open while holding a microphone. She is likely at a concert or a live event, where she is the main performer. Holding a microphone is essential for amplifying her voice so that the audience can hear her clearly and loudly. The woman's dramatic performance, combined with her full-mouthed singing, enhances the energy and excitement of the event, engaging the audience and creating a memorable experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a woman who appears to be singing passionately into a microphone. Her hair is flying upwards and back, suggesting energetic movement, likely from her performance. She's wearing what looks like a black sequined top, indicating this is likely a stage performance.\n\nThe woman is holding a microphone because she's singing or performing. Microphones are essential tools for vocalists, especially in live performances, as they amplify the voice so it can be heard clearly by the audience. The way she's gripping the microphone and her open mouth suggest she's in the middle of belting out a song with great intensity.\n\nThe dramatic lighting, her expressive pose, and the flying hair all contribute to capturing a dynamic moment in what appears to be an energetic musical performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the woman is singing.\n2. Look for mention of a microphone and open mouth as indicators of singing.\n3. Description of the woman's expressive body language or facial expression.",
