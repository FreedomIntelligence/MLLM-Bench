    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the machinery and materials being used by the individual to deduce the artisanal or trade profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the profession appears to be that of a tailor or seamster. The key evidence for this conclusion includes:\n\n1. Sewing Machine: The individual is using an old-style sewing machine, which is the primary tool for tailoring and garment alterations.\n\n2. Fabric: There are various fabrics and textiles visible in the background and on the work surface.\n\n3. Work Environment: The setting appears to be an outdoor market or bazaar, where tailors often set up shop to offer their services.\n\n4. Task at Hand: The person seems to be working on a piece of black fabric, likely altering or repairing a garment.\n\n5. Surrounding Items: Stacks of folded fabrics or clothes can be seen around the work area, consistent with a tailor's workspace.\n\nThe combination of the sewing machine, fabrics, and the work being performed strongly indicates that this individual is engaged in the tailoring trade, offering clothing alterations, repairs, or custom garment creation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe individual in the image is using a sewing machine and surrounded by a variety of clothing items. From these observations and the fact that the person is wearing glasses, it is highly probable that they are a tailor, a dressmaker, or someone engaged in the trade of sewing and crafting clothing items. The presence of the numerous garments and hand-crafted items in the background further supports this conclusion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the trade profession using visible machinery (sewing machine) and materials (fabric).\n2. Assess the context of the setting to support the profession deduced.",
