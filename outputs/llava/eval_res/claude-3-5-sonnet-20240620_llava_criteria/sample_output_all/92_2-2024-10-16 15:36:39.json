    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the main topic of the image, and assign a proper hashtag for this image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main topic of this image is a creative and humorous recreation of a Viking character using household items. The image shows a series of photos where a person uses a large kitchen strainer or colander with long bristles to mimic a Viking's beard and helmet. In the final panel, there's a cartoon illustration of a Viking for comparison.\n\nThis playful DIY costume demonstrates ingenuity and a sense of humor, turning everyday objects into a fun costume piece. The progression from holding the \"beard\" to fully embodying the Viking character is both clever and amusing.\n\nA proper hashtag for this image could be:\n\n#DIYVikingCosplay\n\nThis hashtag captures the essence of the creative, do-it-yourself approach to costume-making and the specific Viking theme portrayed in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a series of four different photos of a man holding a large broom. In each frame, the man's appearance changes, including the size of the broom, the man's attire, and the overall setting. The hashtag for this image would be #largebroomseries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response describes the image as related to cosplay.\n2. Check for an appropriate hashtag that resonates with the image's cosplay theme.\n3.
