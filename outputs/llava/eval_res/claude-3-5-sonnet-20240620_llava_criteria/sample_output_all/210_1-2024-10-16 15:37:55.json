Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the flow chart, as a undergraduate student who did not draw much attention, what should I call my professor who does not have a PhD?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs an undergraduate student, it is advisable for you to call your professor who does not have a PhD by their proper academic title followed by their first name, unless they explicitly request a different form of address. According to the flowchart, if you need to call this particular professor, you should start by calling them by their title (e.g., \"Professor Smith\") followed by their first name (\"Professor Smith\"). Always be respectful and courteous when addressing your professors, regardless of their educational background.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAccording to the flow chart, as an undergraduate student whose professor does not have a PhD, you should call your professor \"Professor So and So\". \n\nThe chart first asks if you're an undergrad (yes in this case), then if you have a death wish (assuming no), then if your professor has a PhD (no in this scenario). Following this path leads to the option \"Do you want to be?\", and assuming you don't want to have a death wish, the chart directs you to call them \"Professor So and So\".\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies path for undergrad students and professors without a PhD.\n2. Answer adheres to the chart's decision: \"Professor So and So.\"\n3. Response reflects understanding of the humor in the chart.",
