    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the image quality, and determine the possible cause of the blurriness.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality is moderate to low, with noticeable blurriness throughout. The underwater scene of what appears to be a coral reef is visible, but lacks sharp detail and clarity.\n\nThe blurriness in this image is likely caused by several factors common in underwater photography:\n\n1. Water diffraction: Light behaves differently underwater, causing some natural blurring and loss of sharpness.\n\n2. Particles in the water: Suspended particles like plankton or sediment can cause a hazy appearance in underwater photos.\n\n3. Camera movement: Slight movements of the photographer or camera in the water can lead to motion blur, especially if a slower shutter speed was used.\n\n4. Focusing issues: Autofocus systems can struggle underwater, potentially resulting in a slightly out-of-focus image.\n\n5. Lower light conditions: Underwater environments often have less available light, which can lead to the use of higher ISO settings or slower shutter speeds, both of which can introduce blur or noise.\n\n6. Possible use of a lower-quality underwater housing or lens port, which might not be optimized for underwater photography.\n\nTo improve the image quality, the photographer could consider using a better underwater camera setup, a faster shutter speed, additional lighting, and techniques to stabilize the camera underwater. Post-processing techniques could also potentially help to sharpen the image and enhance contrast to some degree.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image quality is poor, with a lot of blurriness due to the fuzzy coral and an unclear underwater view. There are many factors that could contribute to poor image quality, including the distance from the subject, camera settings, water clarity, or even the condition of the camera itself. The blurriness may not allow for a detailed examination of the coral reef structure, which could provide valuable information about marine life and ecosystems. It is essential to ensure that future underwater images are of high quality for more accurate identification and understanding of marine environments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess sharpness and clarity; mention if image details are distinguishable.\n2. Identify potential causes of blurriness, such as camera motion or water distortion.\n3. Evaluate color fidelity and noise levels, considering underwater lighting conditions.",
