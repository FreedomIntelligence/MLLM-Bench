    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a professional meeting or interview scenario in a modern office setting. The handshake is taking place between two individuals: one with curly red hair wearing a denim jacket, seated on one side of the table, and a man with graying hair and beard wearing a light gray blazer over a blue shirt, seated on the opposite side.\n\nThe handshake appears warm and friendly, with both parties smiling, suggesting a positive interaction. The man in the blazer is leaning forward slightly, indicating engagement and interest. His smile appears genuine, which could imply satisfaction with the meeting's progress or outcome.\n\nA third person, a woman with dark hair wearing an orange sweater, is seated next to the man in the blazer. She's observing the handshake with a pleasant expression, suggesting she's part of the same team or supporting the man in the blazer.\n\nThe setting and body language suggest this could be:\n1. A job interview concluding positively\n2. A business deal being sealed\n3. A successful client meeting\n4. An introduction or welcome to a new team member\n\nThe presence of a laptop, notebooks, and water glasses on the table reinforces the professional nature of the interaction. The modern office space with artistic wall decorations in the background adds to the contemporary business atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of successful professional collaboration, with the handshake symbolizing agreement, partnership, or a positive conclusion to their discussion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
