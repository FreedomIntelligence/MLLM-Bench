    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the crest for symbolic meanings, researching historical or cultural meanings to the elements on the logo, and provide an assessment of what organizations or entities might use such a crest.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe crest features a decorative design with both yellow and purple elements, along with a variety of writing, possibly in Japanese. The crest shows a bird, a dragon or a lion, and a sword. These symbols can represent different meanings, depending on the context in which they are used.\n\nThe bird likely symbolizes freedom, strength, or determination, while the dragon is often associated with power, courage, and good fortune. The lion is strong, brave, and represents leadership qualities. The sword can symbolize protection, courage, or authority. \n\nRegarding organizations that might use such a crest, it could be associated with martial arts, sports teams, military groups, or companies that provide security or protective services. The presence of Japanese writing and the specific design elements might indicate a connection to Japanese culture, art, or history. In any case, the crest is a rich and complex symbol, reflecting a combination of positive attributes and qualities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis crest is a striking design that combines several symbolic elements in a purple and gold color scheme, which are often associated with royalty, nobility, and wisdom.\n\nThe crest features a shield divided vertically into two halves:\n\n1. Left side: Appears to be a stylized animal, possibly a deer or stag. In heraldry, deer often symbolize peace, harmony, and wisdom. The antlers could represent strength and regeneration.\n\n2. Right side: Resembles a wing or a flame. Wings typically symbolize freedom, aspiration, and protection. If it's a flame, it could represent enlightenment, purification, or passion.\n\nThe overall design has a yin-yang quality, suggesting balance and harmony between different forces or concepts.\n\nBelow the shield is a banner with what appears to be Chinese characters. This indicates a connection to Chinese culture or language.\n\nThe combination of Western heraldic traditions with Chinese script suggests a fusion of Eastern and Western elements, which could represent:\n\n1. An international or multicultural organization\n2. An educational institution with a global focus\n3. A cultural exchange program or institute\n\nOrganizations that might use such a crest include:\n\n1. Universities or colleges with strong international programs, particularly those specializing in East Asian studies\n2. Cultural foundations promoting East-West understanding\n3. International businesses with strong ties to both Western and Chinese markets\n4. Government agencies involved in international relations, particularly with China\n5. Non-profit organizations focused on cross-cultural education and exchange\n\nThe purple and gold colors, combined with the scholarly and cultural symbolism, strongly suggest an educational or academic institution. The crest likely belongs to a university or college that prides itself on international relations, particularly with China, and emphasizes wisdom, aspiration, and cultural exchange in its mission.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
