    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the image in detail. Which bible verse perfectly describes this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image is a surreal and metaphorical representation of life's journey guided by knowledge and wisdom. The scene depicts a vast, open field under a soft, cloudy sky. In the foreground, there's an enormous open book lying on the grass, with its pages forming a winding path that leads off into the distance.\n\nAn older man is shown stepping onto this book-path, seemingly about to embark on a journey. He's dressed casually in jeans and a plaid shirt, leaning forward as if examining the path before him. The book's pages curl up at the edges, creating a defined walkway through the grassy field.\n\nTo the left of the book-path, there's a small wooden sign that reads \"RIGHT PATH,\" indicating that this journey through knowledge is the correct way forward.\n\nIn the background, the field stretches out to the horizon, with a lone tree visible in the distance and birds flying in the sky, adding to the sense of expansiveness and possibility.\n\nA Bible verse that perfectly describes this picture could be Psalm 119:105:\n\n\"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.\"\n\nThis verse captures the essence of the image, where the book (representing God's word or wisdom) is literally forming the path for the man to walk on, guiding his journey through life.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man standing in a grassy field with a giant book under his feet. There are also two smaller books in the scene. The man appears to be reading the book and may be surprised by its massive size. The image seems to be a creative and surreal depiction, with the man potentially engaged in some kind of fantastical or imaginative scenario.\n\nA fitting bible verse to describe this picture would be Psalm 40:4: \"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.\" This verse emphasizes the value of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and could be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of reading and learning throughout life. In the context of the image, the man's engagement with the giant book may symbolize a pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, as well as an appreciation for the power of literature and imagination.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the man, open book path, sign \"RIGHT PATH\", and relate to Psalm 119:105.\n2. Explain how the image metaphorically represents the given bible verse.",
