    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCritique the ad's implication of female competence and its potential impact on stereotypes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis advertisement is highly problematic in its portrayal of female competence and reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. The tagline \"You mean a woman can open it?\" implies that women are typically incapable of performing simple tasks, such as opening a bottle. This rhetoric is deeply sexist and undermines women's abilities and intelligence.\n\nThe ad's implication of female incompetence can have several negative impacts on societal perceptions:\n\n1. Reinforcing gender stereotypes: It perpetuates the outdated notion that women are less capable than men, especially in physical tasks.\n\n2. Undermining women's confidence: Such messaging can contribute to imposter syndrome and self-doubt among women.\n\n3. Normalizing sexism: By presenting this idea in a casual, supposedly humorous context, it normalizes sexist attitudes in everyday life.\n\n4. Limiting perceptions of women's roles: It indirectly suggests that women's capabilities are limited, which can affect how they are perceived in professional and personal spheres.\n\n5. Encouraging gender-based discrimination: Such stereotypes can lead to real-world discrimination in various contexts, including employment and education.\n\nThe visual elements of the ad, showing a woman with an exaggerated expression of surprise, further emphasize the supposed novelty of female competence. This imagery, combined with the text, creates a patronizing and belittling tone towards women.\n\nIn terms of its potential impact on stereotypes, this type of advertising can:\n\n1. Entrench existing biases: For those who already hold sexist views, it provides validation.\n2. Influence younger generations: Children exposed to such messaging may internalize these stereotypes.\n3. Slow progress towards gender equality: By perpetuating outdated ideas, it can hinder societal advancement in gender relations.\n\nIn conclusion, this advertisement is a clear example of how media can propagate harmful stereotypes. It's crucial to critique and challenge such portrayals to promote a more equitable and respectful representation of all genders in advertising and media.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a woman opening a bottle of ketchup, with the phrase \"you mean a woman can open it\" in white text, which implies that it is usually associated with men. This kind of stereotype perpetuates the notion that women are not as capable as men in tasks that involve physical strength and dexterity. This can have negative consequences on societal expectations and attitudes towards women, leading to a lack of opportunities, unequality, and limited perception of women's abilities. Such an advertisement may also promote the idea that women need to prove their competence in performing tasks that are typically considered \"manly\", reinforcing gender stereotypes and limiting the potential of women.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response recognizes the ad's implied message about female competence.\n2. Assess the response's insight on the ad's reinforcement or challenge of gender stereotypes.\n3. Evaluate the response's consideration of the potential societal impact of such stereotypes.",
