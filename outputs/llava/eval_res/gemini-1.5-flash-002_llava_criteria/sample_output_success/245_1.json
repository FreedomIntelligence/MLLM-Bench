    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the texture of the skin of fruits in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the apple has a smooth, glossy skin, while the orange has a rough, slightly textured skin.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a comparison of the textures of the apple and orange skin in the image:\n\nThe apple's skin appears smooth and relatively even in texture.  There's a subtle fine texture, but no significant bumps or irregularities are visible.  The color is consistent, suggesting a smooth, waxy surface.\n\nThe orange's skin, in contrast, has a noticeably rougher texture.  It's pebbled or bumpy, with many small, slightly raised areas.  The texture is more uneven than the apple's.  The surface appears slightly porous.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention apple's smooth, glossy skin and orange's dimpled, pebbled texture.",
