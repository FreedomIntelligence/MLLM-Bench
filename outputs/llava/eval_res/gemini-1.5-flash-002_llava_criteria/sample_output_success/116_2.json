    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe emotion expressed in the image is a blend of **overwhelm, distress, and a desire for distance or protection**.  The woman's posture, with one hand partially covering her face and the other held up as if to ward something off, suggests she's feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed by something.  Her slightly downturned mouth and the way she's turned slightly away also contribute to this impression. It's not necessarily fear, but more a sense of being burdened or emotionally flooded.\n\nSeveral contexts or situations could be causing this emotional state:\n\n1. **Grief or Loss:** The woman might be processing a recent loss – the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, or the loss of a job. The overwhelm could be from the emotional weight of the situation, and the hand gestures might represent a desire to shield herself from the pain.\n\n2. **Difficult Conversation or Confrontation:** She may have just had or be anticipating a challenging conversation, perhaps an argument with a family member, a disagreement with a colleague, or a confrontation about a difficult issue.  The hand gestures could be a subconscious attempt to create emotional distance or block out the negativity.\n\n3. **Overwhelming Stress or Anxiety:**  The woman could be experiencing a period of intense stress due to work pressures, financial difficulties, or other life challenges. The combination of stress and emotional exhaustion could lead to this overwhelmed and protective posture.\n\n4. **Trauma or PTSD Trigger:**  Something in her environment – a sound, a smell, or a visual cue – might have triggered a traumatic memory or a PTSD response. The hand gestures could be a self-soothing mechanism or an attempt to create a sense of safety and control.\n\n5. **Social Anxiety or Social Situation:** She may be in a social situation that is making her feel uncomfortable or anxious. The hand gestures could be a way of trying to withdraw from the interaction or create a barrier between herself and others.\n\n6. **Difficult Medical News:** The woman might have just received some upsetting medical news, either for herself or a loved one. The overwhelmed feeling and protective gestures would be a natural response to such a stressful situation.\n\n\nThe ambiguity of the image allows for multiple interpretations, but the core emotion seems to be one of distress and a need for emotional and perhaps physical space.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
