    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's an analysis of the indoor space depicted:\n\n**Architectural Style:** The architectural style is **Neoclassical** with Baroque influences.  Several features point to this:\n\n* **Symmetry and Proportion:** The space is highly symmetrical, with the paintings evenly spaced on either side of a central axis.  This is a hallmark of Neoclassical design.\n* **High Ceilings and Grand Scale:** The soaring ceilings and long, narrow gallery create a sense of grandeur, typical of Neoclassical and Baroque architecture.\n* **Ornate Moldings and Cornices:** The elaborate gilded moldings and cornices along the walls and ceiling demonstrate Baroque influences, adding richness and detail to the Neoclassical framework.\n* **Skylight:**  The large, gridded skylight provides natural light, a feature often found in Neoclassical buildings designed to showcase art.\n* **Color Palette:** The muted, rich brown tones of the walls are characteristic of Neoclassical interiors.\n\n\n**Cultural Function:** The cultural function is clearly that of an **art gallery or museum**. The space is specifically designed for the display and appreciation of paintings.  The arrangement of the paintings, the lighting, and the overall atmosphere all contribute to this function.  The presence of visitors viewing the artwork further reinforces this.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style elements like wall decor, ceiling, and lighting.\n2. Determine cultural function based on room contents and visitor activity.",
