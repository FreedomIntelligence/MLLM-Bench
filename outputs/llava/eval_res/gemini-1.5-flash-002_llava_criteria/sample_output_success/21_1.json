    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a man performing a **barbell bench press**.\n\n**Technical Essentials:**\n\nThe barbell bench press is a compound exercise that primarily works the pectoral muscles (chest), triceps (back of the upper arm), and anterior deltoids (front of the shoulders).  Proper form is crucial to avoid injury.  Key aspects include:\n\n* **Lie flat:** The lifter lies supine on a weight bench with their feet flat on the floor.\n* **Grip:**  The lifter grasps the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n* **Lowering:** The barbell is lowered slowly and controlled to the chest, touching the chest lightly.\n* **Pushing:** The barbell is then pushed back up to the starting position, extending the arms fully but avoiding locking the elbows.\n* **Breathing:**  Inhale during the lowering phase and exhale during the pushing phase.\n* **Spotter:**  A spotter is recommended, especially when lifting heavier weights, to assist in case of failure.\n\n\nIncorrect form can lead to injuries, particularly to the shoulders, elbows, and wrists.  It's important to start with lighter weights to master the technique before increasing the load.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
