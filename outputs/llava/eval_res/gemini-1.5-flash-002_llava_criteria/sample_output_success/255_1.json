    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a description of the species-specific features of the big cats depicted in the image:\n\n* **Tiger ( *Panthera tigris*)**: The tiger is easily identified by its distinctive orange and black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in its natural habitat.  Its body is relatively long and slender, and it has a powerful build. The head is rounder than the lion's, and the stripes extend to the face.\n\n* **Lion (*Panthera leo*)**: The male lion is characterized by its prominent mane, a feature absent in the female.  The lion's body is robust and muscular, and its overall coloration is a uniform tawny or light brown.  The mane is typically a darker brown or even black.  The face is broader and more rounded than the tiger's.\n\n* **Cougar/Puma (*Puma concolor*)**: The cougar, also known as a mountain lion or puma, has a uniformly colored coat, typically tawny or brownish-gray, with no stripes or spots. It has a long, muscular body, a relatively short tail, and a small, rounded head.  Its overall appearance is sleek and streamlined.\n\n* **Lioness with cubs (*Panthera leo*)**: The lioness lacks the mane, exhibiting the same tawny coloration as the male but without the prominent mane. The cubs are smaller versions of the adult lioness, also tawny-colored, though their coats might appear slightly lighter or fuzzier.\n\n\nThe illustration effectively highlights the key differences in coat pattern (stripes vs. uniform color), mane presence (male lion only), body shape (slender tiger vs. robust lion), and head shape.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
