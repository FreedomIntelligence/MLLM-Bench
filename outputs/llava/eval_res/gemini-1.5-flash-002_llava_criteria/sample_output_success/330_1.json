    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the disaster appears to be a landslide or debris flow of significant intensity and relatively short duration.\n\n**Intensity:** The intensity is high.  The image shows complete or near-complete destruction of multiple structures. Homes are largely reduced to rubble, with significant amounts of debris scattered across a wide area. The scale of the destruction suggests a powerful force, capable of moving large amounts of earth and debris with considerable momentum.\n\n**Duration:** The duration was likely short.  There's no evidence of prolonged erosion or gradual collapse. The sudden and catastrophic nature of the damage suggests a rapid event, such as a flash flood or a sudden slope failure, rather than a slow-moving process.  The debris is relatively unweathered, suggesting it hasn't been exposed to the elements for an extended period.  The fact that rescue workers are already on the scene also implies a recent occurrence.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a high-intensity, short-duration disaster, likely a landslide or debris flow, that caused widespread destruction in a localized area.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
