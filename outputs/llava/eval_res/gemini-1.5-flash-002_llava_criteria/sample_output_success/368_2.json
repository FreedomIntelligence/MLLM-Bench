    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\n Invent a conversation that could be occurring between two or more characters in the image. The dialogue should reveal their relationships and individual characters, as well as reflect the atmosphere of the setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a possible conversation based on the image:\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* **Nomusa:** The woman with dark curly hair, wearing a white top and denim shorts. She's a bit quieter and observant.\n* **Thandi:** The woman in the white vest and jeans, sipping wine. She's confident and outgoing, the de facto leader of the group.\n* **Lerato:** The woman in the white top and jeans next to Thandi. She's bubbly and playful.\n* **Zinhle:** The woman with long dark hair, wearing a white sleeveless top and jeans. She's stylish and a bit more reserved than Lerato.\n\n**Conversation:**\n\n**Thandi:** (Toasting her glass) Cheers, ladies! To another year of friendship, laughter, and… well, maybe a little too much wine.\n\n**Lerato:** (Laughing)  Definitely a little too much wine!  But hey, it's my birthday!  We deserve it.\n\n**Zinhle:** (Smiling) Happy birthday, Lerato.  This setting is perfect.  So peaceful.\n\n**Nomusa:** (Quietly)  It is beautiful. I love how they’ve decorated the table.  So elegant.\n\n**Thandi:**  I know, right?  I found this place online.  It’s called “Sunstone Gardens.”  Apparently, they specialize in these gorgeous outdoor picnics.\n\n**Lerato:**  You outdid yourself, Thandi.  This is way better than that karaoke bar we went to last year.\n\n**Thandi:** (Chuckles)  Let’s not talk about that.  Some memories are best left buried.\n\n**Zinhle:**  (Teasingly)  Oh, come on, Thandi.  You were surprisingly good at belting out Whitney Houston.\n\n**Thandi:** (Laughing)  Okay, maybe I was a *little* good.  But this is much more my style.  Relaxing, sophisticated… and less likely to involve public humiliation.\n\n**Nomusa:** (Smiling slightly)  I agree.  This is lovely.\n\n**Lerato:**  So, what are we doing after this?  More wine?  Dancing?  Maybe some…  (leans in conspiratorially) …karaoke?\n\n**Thandi:** (Raises an eyebrow)  Lerato, we agreed. No karaoke.  Unless you want to sing alone in the car on the way home.\n\n**Lerato:** (Feigning disappointment)  Fine.  But you’re buying the next round of wine.\n\n**All the women laugh, clinking their glasses together.**  The sound of laughter and clinking glass mingles with the gentle sounds of the garden, creating a warm and convivial atmosphere.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of women is enjoying a casual gathering of drinks and food on the patio of a house. They are seated at a long dining table, engaging in conversation and laughter. As they sip wine and share food, the women discuss various topics, such as life events, friendship, and recent trends. Overall, the atmosphere seems relaxed and social, with a sense of camaraderie among the group.\n\nOne woman, who could be the hostess, is chatting animatedly with a close friend about their recent vacation. They reminisce about their shared experiences and laugh about the silly moments they encountered during their trip. Another woman, who may be a family member or relative of the hosts, chimes in and comments on the lovely ambiance of the backyard gathering. She shares a story about a similar event she once attended, and everyone eagerly listens and enjoys the tale. \n\nWith the backdrop of yellow balloons and the warm weather, the scene exudes a sense of joy and togetherness. The women seated together at the table, engaged in lively conversations, make for a captivating snapshot of friendship and celebration.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Dialogue reflects a friendly or familial relationship and individual character traits.\n2. Conversation fits a casual, outdoor gathering atmosphere.\n3. Includes context from the setting, such as the outdoor meal or celebration.",
