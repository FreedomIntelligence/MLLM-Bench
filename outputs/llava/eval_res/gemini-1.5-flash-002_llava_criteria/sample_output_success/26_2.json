    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the writing posture of the girl in the picture and make some suggestions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the picture is leaning very close to her work, hunching her shoulders and neck.  This posture is not ideal for long periods of writing or studying.  It can lead to neck pain, back pain, and eye strain.\n\nHere are some suggestions for improving her writing posture:\n\n* **Sit up straight:** She should sit with her back straight, her shoulders relaxed, and her feet flat on the floor.  A chair with good back support would be beneficial.\n\n* **Adjust the height of her chair and table:** The height of her chair and table should be adjusted so that her elbows are at a 90-degree angle when she's writing.  This will help to prevent strain on her shoulders and neck.\n\n* **Keep her head up:**  She needs to avoid hunching over her work.  She should look straight ahead, keeping her head up and her chin parallel to the floor.\n\n* **Take breaks:** Frequent short breaks are crucial.  Every 30-45 minutes, she should stand up, stretch, and walk around to relieve tension.\n\n* **Use proper lighting:** Good lighting is essential to prevent eye strain.  The light source should be positioned to avoid glare on her paper.\n\n* **Consider an ergonomic writing surface:** A slightly slanted writing surface can help to improve posture and reduce strain.\n\n\nBy making these adjustments, the girl can significantly improve her writing posture, reduce the risk of pain and discomfort, and improve her overall comfort and concentration while studying.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe girl in the photo appears to have her elbow resting on the desk while writing. While this posture may provide additional support and comfort, it is not ideal for maintaining a proper and healthy writing posture. For better posture, the girl should consider adopting one of the following suggestions:\n\n1. Hold the pen or pencil in both hands and use a firm grip to minimize strain on the wrist and fingers.\n2. Place the notebook or book on a flat surface, like a desk or a lap, allowing the writing surface to be easily accessible.\n3. Keep the elbows slightly bent and maintain a relaxed, neutral position while writing.\n4. Maintain a comfortable position for the wrists and avoid bending them excessively while writing.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the girl can improve her writing posture, reduce the risk of strain or discomfort, and maintain a healthy and efficient writing experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the girl's posture is ergonomically correct for writing.\n2. Assess the angle of the girl's neck and back in relation to the desk.\n3. Suggest improvements for a healthier writing posture.",
