    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a business meeting or negotiation, likely a job interview or a client meeting.  The central action is a handshake between a woman with curly red hair and a man with graying hair.  Several nuances suggest the nature of their relationship:\n\n* **The Handshake:** The handshake is firm and appears to be a positive interaction, suggesting a degree of mutual respect and possibly a successful conclusion to whatever was being discussed.  It's not a fleeting or perfunctory handshake, indicating some level of significance.\n\n* **Body Language:** The man is smiling warmly, indicating approachability and possibly satisfaction. The woman also appears pleased, though her expression is more reserved.  The woman in the orange sweater observes the handshake with a look of interest or mild anticipation. Her posture suggests engagement but also a degree of cautious observation.\n\n* **Setting:** The professional office setting with a whiteboard displaying words (possibly keywords related to the business) reinforces the business context. The glass partition suggests a degree of transparency and openness, but also a level of separation, perhaps indicating a formal setting.\n\n* **The Third Person:** The presence of a woman in an orange sweater adds another layer of complexity.  She is observing the interaction closely, suggesting she may be a colleague, partner, or a participant in the same meeting. Her presence could indicate a collaborative effort, or perhaps a competitive element, depending on the context.\n\n**Potential Relationships and Scenarios:**\n\nSeveral scenarios are plausible:\n\n* **Job Interview:** The man could be an interviewer, and the woman with red hair a candidate who has just successfully completed an interview. The woman in orange might be a colleague of the interviewer.\n\n* **Business Deal:** The handshake could seal a business deal between the man and woman, with the third woman as a witness or representative of a related party.\n\n* **Client Meeting:** The man could be a representative of a company presenting a proposal to the woman, with the third woman as a colleague or client representative.\n\n* **Internal Meeting:** The interaction could be within a company, with the handshake representing the agreement on a project or strategy.\n\nWithout additional information, it's impossible to definitively determine the exact nature of the relationship. However, the overall impression is one of a positive and successful interaction within a professional context.  The image strongly suggests a collaborative or mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
