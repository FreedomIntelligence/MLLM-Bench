    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the provided images showing the evolution of Presidential automobiles from 1909 to 1950, we can infer several future design trends:\n\n**1. Increased Size and Luxury:**  The progression shows a clear trend towards larger, more luxurious vehicles.  Early models were relatively small and utilitarian; later models became significantly longer, wider, and more opulent, featuring more passenger space and comfort features. This suggests future automotive design will continue to prioritize spaciousness and high-end finishes, possibly even more so than currently seen in luxury vehicles.\n\n**2. Streamlining and Aerodynamics:** While early cars were boxy, later models, particularly from the 1930s onwards, exhibit more streamlined designs. This reflects a growing emphasis on aerodynamics for improved fuel efficiency and performance. Future designs will likely push this further, with even more sculpted bodies and advanced aerodynamic features.\n\n**3. Technological Advancements:** The shift from steam power to internal combustion engines, and the increasing complexity of the vehicles over time, points to a continued integration of advanced technologies.  Future cars will likely incorporate even more sophisticated powertrains (electric, hybrid, hydrogen), autonomous driving systems, advanced safety features, and in-car entertainment and connectivity.\n\n**4. Emphasis on Passenger Comfort and Safety:**  The evolution from open-top vehicles to enclosed, climate-controlled cars demonstrates a growing concern for passenger comfort and safety.  Future designs will likely prioritize features enhancing both, such as advanced climate control, noise reduction technologies, and sophisticated safety systems (airbags, collision avoidance, etc.).\n\n**5. Personalization and Customization:** While not explicitly shown in the historical progression, the variety of models used by different presidents hints at a potential future trend towards greater customization options to cater to individual preferences.  This could manifest in bespoke interiors, exterior styling choices, and even personalized technological features.\n\n\n**However, it's important to note limitations:**  The data set only covers a specific niche (Presidential vehicles) and a limited time frame.  The trends observed might not be fully representative of broader automotive design evolution.  Furthermore, external factors like environmental regulations, material science advancements, and societal shifts could significantly influence future design directions beyond what's suggested by this historical data.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
