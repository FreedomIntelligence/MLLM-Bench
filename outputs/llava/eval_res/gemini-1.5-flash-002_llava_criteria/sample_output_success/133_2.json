    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image,  describe the settings and identify the type of activity taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a person playing a first-person shooter video game in a dimly lit room.  The setting appears to be a gaming room or internet cafe, with multiple computer monitors visible. The person is wearing a headset and is actively engaged in gameplay, using a keyboard and mouse.  The activity is clearly video game playing, specifically a competitive online game judging by the in-game HUD.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a person sitting at a desk with two desktop computer screens and a keyboard in front of them. The individual is engaged in a video game activity, using the computer screens to play an online video game. It appears to be a gaming setup, possibly for a multiplayer or first-person shooter game, given the presence of two screens and a keyboard for controlling the game. The person is focused on the screens, likely interacting with the game to progress through levels or complete objectives.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify indoor setting with computer gaming equipment.\n2. Recognize the activity as playing a video game.",
