    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happened to each row of the image from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom left to right, each row has one row with a man and the rest of the rows have women.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a description of what happened to each row of images, going from left to right:\n\nThe images demonstrate a process of increasing resolution and detail, likely illustrating a concept in image processing or machine learning, such as image upscaling or generative modeling.\n\n* **Row 1:**  The images start with a very low-resolution, pixelated version of a face.  This is the lowest level of detail. Then the resolution gradually increases, becoming progressively clearer and less pixelated.  The final image on the right shows a high-resolution, clear image.\n\n* **Row 2:** This row shows a similar progression as the first, but starting with a slightly higher resolution than the first row.  The images go from blurry and indistinct to sharp and detailed.  The blurring effect is likely a form of downsampling or a low-pass filter applied to the image.\n\n* **Row 3:** This row again shows the same pattern, starting with a low-resolution, pixelated image and gradually increasing the resolution and detail until the final image is sharp.\n\n* **Row 4:** This row is identical to the previous rows, showing the same progression from low-resolution to high-resolution images.  The process is consistent across all rows.\n\nIn summary, each row depicts a progressive increase in image resolution and clarity, starting from a heavily pixelated or blurred state and ending with a sharp, high-resolution image.  This likely demonstrates an image enhancement or reconstruction technique.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the progression of image quality from left to right in each row.\n2. Confirm the presence of human faces in varying resolutions and clarity in the image.\n3. Assess if the description includes changes in detail and recognizability.",
