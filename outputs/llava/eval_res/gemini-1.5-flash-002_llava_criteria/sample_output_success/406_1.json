    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a description of the image:\n\nThe image shows a single ginger cat lying on a light beige paved area, possibly concrete or stone. The cat is positioned centrally and is facing the viewer.  Its fur is a light to medium orange, appearing relatively short and slightly unkempt. The cat's expression is calm and somewhat watchful; its eyes are open and focused on the camera.  Its body is relaxed, limbs sprawled out comfortably.\n\nThe background is a modern building with large windows and light-colored walls. The building appears to be multi-storied, with a visible balcony or walkway featuring horizontal slats. The windows are rectangular and reflect some light, suggesting it's likely daytime.  A dark gray or black vertical post or pillar is partially visible behind and to the right of the cat, suggesting it might be an outdoor area, perhaps a patio or courtyard.  The overall lighting suggests it's a sunny day, with the sunlight illuminating the cat and its surroundings.  The environment appears clean and relatively quiet.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
