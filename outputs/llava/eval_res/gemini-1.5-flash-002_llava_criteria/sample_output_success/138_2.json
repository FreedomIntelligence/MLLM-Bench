    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the profession is likely **road construction or railway maintenance**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **The Pickaxe:** The most prominent tool is a pickaxe, a tool frequently used for breaking up hard surfaces like rock, asphalt, or concrete. This is common in road construction and railway maintenance where tracks need to be repaired or new sections built.\n\n* **Postures:** The postures of the workers suggest strenuous physical labor.  One person is actively using the pickaxe, while others appear to be either assisting or taking a break. This is consistent with the physical demands of road/railway work.\n\n* **The Setting:** While not entirely clear, the background suggests a large, somewhat uneven surface, consistent with a road or railway bed.  The pile of material in the foreground could be rubble or broken-up material from the work site.\n\nWhile other professions might involve pickaxes, the combination of the tool, the postures, and the implied setting strongly suggests road or railway work.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
