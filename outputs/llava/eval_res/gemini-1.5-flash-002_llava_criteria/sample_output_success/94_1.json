    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I want to post the image to Twitter, help me assign a topical hashtag that aligns with the post.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nWhile the image features a skeletal head diagram with labels, it seems to be part of a larger context, possibly a medical or scientific textbook. A suitable hashtag for a Twitter post might be #anatomy, #medicine, #education, or #science. To make your tweet more engaging, you could also share a quote or a thought related to the content of the image that would resonate with your audience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are a few hashtag suggestions for your Twitter post, depending on the angle you want to take:\n\n* **#Phrenology:** This is the most straightforward and accurate hashtag, as the image depicts a phrenological chart.\n\n* **#VintageScience:** This hashtag highlights the historical context of the image.\n\n* **#MedicalHistory:**  This is appropriate given the image's relation to a now-discredited medical theory.\n\n* **#BrainMap:** This is a more general hashtag that might attract a broader audience interested in the brain.\n\n* **#PseudoScience:** This hashtag acknowledges the image's connection to a field that's no longer considered scientifically valid.  This might be appropriate if you want to spark discussion about the history of pseudoscience.\n\n* **#HistoricalChart:** A more general option that focuses on the visual aspect of the image.\n\nYou could also combine several of these hashtags for broader reach.  For example: `#Phrenology #VintageScience #MedicalHistory`\n\n\nThe best choice will depend on your intended audience and the message you want to convey.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the hashtag relates to historical/educational diagrams or phrenology.\n2. Check hashtag relevance to the image content, including terms like 'brain', 'mind', 'map'.\n3. Ensure the hashtag is appropriate for social media sharing and not offensive.",
