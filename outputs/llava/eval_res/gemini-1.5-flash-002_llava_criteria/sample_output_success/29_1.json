    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the activity taking place, why are they pulling the rope?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a group of people, including children and teenagers, standing on a field of grass and pulling a rope. This activity seems to be an organized team-building event or an organized game where participants need to work together to achieve a common goal. The exact purpose of pulling the rope is unclear; it could be related to a tug-of-war, an obstacle course, or a symbolic gesture. It is evident that the activity requires cooperation and coordination among the participants, which aims to foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding among the team members.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe activity is a game of tug-of-war.  The children are pulling the rope as part of a competition to see which team can pull the other across a designated line.  It appears to be a recreational activity taking place outside of a school building.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity as tug-of-war.\n2. Confirm the action involves pulling a rope.\n3. Explain the reason for pulling the rope is a competitive effort.",
