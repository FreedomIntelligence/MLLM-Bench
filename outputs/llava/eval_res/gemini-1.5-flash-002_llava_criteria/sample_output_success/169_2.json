    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a description of the steps to open a new book, based on the provided image, followed by an evaluation of the instructions' clarity and effectiveness:\n\n**Steps to Open a New Book:**\n\n1. **Lay the book flat:** Place the book on a table with its spine (back) resting on the surface.\n\n2. **Open the front cover:** Gently lower the front cover.\n\n3. **Open the back cover:** Gently lower the back cover.\n\n4. **Alternating pages:** Open a few pages from the front, then a few from the back.  Repeat this process, alternating front and back.\n\n5. **Gently press down:** While alternating pages, gently press down on the opened pages, working your way towards the center of the book.\n\n6. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 4 and 5 two or three times to loosen the binding.\n\n**Never force the book open.** If the spine resists, it's too tightly bound and needs more gentle treatment.\n\n\n**Evaluation of Clarity and Effectiveness:**\n\nThe instructions are fairly clear and effective, especially when accompanied by the visual aids.  The numbered steps would improve clarity. The diagrams clearly show the process.  The text is concise and easy to understand.  The warning against forcing the book open is crucial and well-placed.\n\nHowever, some improvements could be made:\n\n* **Specificity:**  The instruction \"a few leaves\" is vague.  Suggesting a more specific number (e.g., \"2-3 pages\") would be helpful.\n* **Emphasis on Gentleness:**  The instructions could emphasize the importance of gentle pressure throughout the process.  Words like \"carefully,\" \"delicately,\" or \"gently\" could be used more frequently.\n* **Angle of Opening:** While the diagrams imply it, the instructions could explicitly state that the book should be opened at a slight angle from the spine, not completely flat.\n* **Alternative phrasing:** Instead of \"limber up the binding,\" which is somewhat unclear, a phrase like \"loosen the spine\" might be more intuitive.\n\n\nOverall, the instructions are good, but minor adjustments could make them even clearer and more user-friendly.  The inclusion of William Matthews' anecdote adds a compelling element, highlighting the potential consequences of improper handling.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List steps to open a new book: place on table, front cover, back cover, alternate leaves, press gently, repeat if needed.\n2. Assess if instructions are clear: sequential order, simple language, easy to follow.\n3. Evaluate effectiveness: steps lead to opening without damaging the book's binding.",
