    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat artwork is representative of **Cubism**, specifically a style that bridges early and synthetic Cubism.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Fragmentation and Geometric Shapes:** The face is broken down into geometric planes and facets, a hallmark of Cubism.  The figure isn't rendered realistically; instead, multiple viewpoints are presented simultaneously.\n\n* **Simultaneity of Views:**  We see the woman's face from the front and possibly a profile view at the same time.  This is a core tenet of Cubist representation.\n\n* **Limited Palette, Bold Colors:**  While a range of colors is used, they are bold and somewhat non-naturalistic. The colors are applied in flat areas, rather than blended smoothly for realistic shading. This is a characteristic of Cubism, particularly its later, Synthetic phase.\n\n* **Emphasis on Form over Representation:** The artist prioritizes the abstract construction of the form over achieving a photorealistic likeness.  The overall effect is less about capturing a specific person and more about exploring the structure of the human form through geometric abstraction.\n\nWhile it's difficult to identify the *specific* artist without more information (like a signature or provenance), the stylistic features strongly suggest a work from the Cubist movement, likely created in the period where early Cubism's analytical approach was giving way to the more synthetic style.  The artist may have been influenced by Picasso or Braque, the pioneers of Cubism, but with a personal interpretation.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
