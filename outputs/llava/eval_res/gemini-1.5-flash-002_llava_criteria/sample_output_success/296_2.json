    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the image is the area currently occupied by the wooden desk and chair.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* **Existing Setup:**  The desk, chair, and hutch are already arranged, suggesting a pre-existing workspace.  This minimizes the need for significant furniture rearrangement or purchase.\n* **Adequate Lighting:** The desk is positioned near a window, providing natural light.  There's also a desk lamp for supplemental lighting.\n* **Privacy (Relative):** While it's in a bedroom, the corner placement offers a degree of visual separation from the bed area.\n* **Space:** The area is large enough to accommodate the existing desk and chair comfortably.  There's also space for storage (the hutch).\n\nWhile the room is small, and not ideal for a dedicated office, this is the best option within the constraints of the existing space shown in the picture.  Other areas lack sufficient surface space or adequate lighting.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
