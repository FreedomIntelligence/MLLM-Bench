    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two images closely to identify and compare the differences between them as many as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe two images show a brown and black dog in different poses and settings. The first image features the dog carrying a bottle in its mouth, with one paw on a bowl and the other paw on a cat. The dog appears to be placing the bottle into the bowl. The second image displays the dog with a bone in its mouth, standing next to a house.\n\nIn the first image, the dog is positioned more towards the left side, while in the second image, it is positioned more towards the right side. Although both images show the dog in action, there are some noticeable differences in the objects the dog is carrying and its surroundings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are ten differences between the two images:\n\n1. **Dog's Left Eye:** The left eye of the dog is slightly different in shape and size.\n\n2. **Dog's Right Ear:** The right ear of the dog is slightly larger in the second image.\n\n3. **Bone in Bowl:** A bone is present in the bowl in the first image, but absent in the second.\n\n4. **Food in Bowl:** The bowl in the second image contains food, while the bowl in the first image is empty.\n\n5. **Fence Post:** One of the fence posts has a slightly different shape near the top.\n\n6. **Flower Petals:** One of the flowers has a different number of petals.\n\n7. **Grass Patches:** There are subtle differences in the shape and size of the grass patches.\n\n8. **Dog House Roof:** The roofline of the dog house has a slightly different angle.\n\n9. **Dog House Door:** The shape of the dog house door opening is slightly different.\n\n10. **Ground Spots:** There are some subtle differences in the size and placement of the small dark spots on the ground.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in dog's eye, collar, posture of the dog's leg, bowl contents, flower, stone, fence knot, grass near the fence, dog house window, and bush.",
