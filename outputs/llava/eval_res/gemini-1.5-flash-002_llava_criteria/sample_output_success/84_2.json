    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a fish, likely a type of wrasse, swimming in an aquarium.  Here's a description to aid identification:\n\n* **Body Shape and Size:** The fish is relatively small to medium-sized (exact size is impossible to determine from the image), with a somewhat elongated, oval body. It's laterally compressed (flattened from side to side).\n\n* **Coloration:** The dominant body color is a muted, greenish-gray or olive-green.  There's a noticeable patch of dark blue or purplish-blue on the lower jaw and chin area.  The pectoral fins (the fins closest to the gills) appear to be a yellowish-tan. The rest of the fins seem dark, possibly black or dark brown.\n\n* **Head:** The head is relatively large compared to the body. The mouth is slightly protrusible (it can extend outwards).  There's a suggestion of some darker markings or lines on the head, but the resolution isn't high enough for precise detail.\n\n* **Fins:** The caudal fin (tail fin) is not clearly visible in its entirety, but appears to be somewhat rounded or slightly forked.  The dorsal fin (along the back) and anal fin (along the belly) are also not fully visible, but seem to be relatively low-profile.\n\n* **Overall Appearance:** The fish has a somewhat plump, robust appearance, not slender or elongated.  Its coloration is fairly subdued, blending with a greenish-blue environment.\n\n\nTo get a more precise identification, additional information would be helpful, such as:\n\n* **Location:** Where was this photo taken (geographic location, specific aquarium)?\n* **Size:**  An approximate length would be very useful.\n* **Behavior:** What was the fish doing?  Was it foraging, resting, or interacting with other fish?\n* **Higher-resolution image:** A clearer image would allow for a more detailed examination of markings and fin shapes.\n\nWith this more detailed description and additional information, a more precise identification could be made.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
