    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe circuit board shows significant signs of overheating and likely a short circuit.  The most prominent evidence is the extensive blackening and charring around components near the center of the board. This indicates a high current flow through those components, generating excessive heat that damaged the board's surface and possibly the components themselves.  The blackened areas suggest significant thermal stress and potential component failure.  The melted solder around some components further supports this conclusion.  The board is likely unusable without extensive repair or replacement, and even then, the underlying cause of the short circuit needs to be identified and addressed to prevent recurrence.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
