    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a breakdown of the elements contributing to the comedic effect in the image:\n\n* **Extreme Close-up/Low Angle:** The perspective is from very close to the cow's face, almost as if the viewer is on the ground looking up. This unusual angle distorts the proportions and creates a sense of intimacy that's unexpected and slightly absurd.  It makes the cow seem larger than life and more in your face.\n\n* **The Tongue:** The cow's tongue sticking out is a classic comedic trope. It's playful and unexpected, suggesting a silly or mischievous personality. The way it's slightly droopy adds to the humor.\n\n* **The Nose:** The large, textured nose takes up a significant portion of the frame. Its close proximity to the camera and detailed texture makes it seem almost cartoonish and emphasizes the cow's unique features.\n\n* **The Expression:** While it's difficult to definitively say what the cow is \"feeling,\" the combination of the tongue, the close-up perspective, and the slightly unfocused eyes creates an expression that reads as goofy, surprised, or even slightly derpy.  There's a lack of menace or seriousness that is key to the humor.\n\n* **The Blurred Background:** The out-of-focus background further emphasizes the cow's face and makes it the sole focus of attention, heightening the comedic effect of the close-up.\n\nIn short, the humor comes from the unexpected intimacy of the close-up shot, combined with the cow's seemingly silly and surprised expression, particularly the prominent tongue.  It's a humorous juxtaposition of a normally majestic animal presented in a ridiculously endearing way.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
