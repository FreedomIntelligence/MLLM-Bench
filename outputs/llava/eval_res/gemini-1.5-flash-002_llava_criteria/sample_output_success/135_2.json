    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the activity taking place and briefly introduce the game rule.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a description of the image and the game:\n\nThe image depicts a group of children playing a game that resembles a variation of \"Red Light, Green Light\" or \"Statue.\"  A boy stands apart, seemingly the \"it\" player, while a large group of children are holding onto each other, forming a chain or line.  The boy who is separate appears to be signaling the group to move or stop.\n\n**Game Rule (Inferred):**  The basic rule would involve the \"it\" player giving a signal (like \"green light\" or a wave) for the chain of children to advance towards them.  When the \"it\" player gives a stopping signal (like \"red light\" or turns their back), the children must freeze.  Any child who moves after the stopping signal is given might be \"out\" or have to return to the starting point.  The game continues until one child reaches the \"it\" player.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of people, including both children and adults, are playing a game together. They are holding hands and are in a circle while one person stands in the center, possibly trying to break the circle. The name of the game is \"Hot Potato\" or an Indian version of it. The objective of the game is for the person standing in the center to pass the ball or potato to another person without letting it touch the ground, essentially becoming the \"hot\" potato. This game is played for fun, as it tests the players' reflexes, agility, and social camaraderie.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity depicted and determine if it aligns with a known children's game.\n2. Explain the basic rule(s) of the game based on the visual cues in the image.",
