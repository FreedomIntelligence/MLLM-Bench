    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the color, shape and other attribute you think would be useful for people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a beautiful, multicolored plant with vibrant green and yellow leaves. The plant exhibits an interesting and colorful flower pattern, making it a striking and attractive feature in the garden. The plant's bright leaves and blooms create an eye-catching and lively effect, adding a unique touch of natural beauty to the garden.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe plant pictured is a Hosta.  Here's a description to help with recognition:\n\n* **Color:** The leaves are predominantly a vibrant chartreuse yellow-green, with irregular streaks and splashes of darker, forest green.  The variegation is quite striking and uneven, not a uniform pattern.\n\n* **Shape:** The leaves are ovate (egg-shaped) with a pointed tip. They are relatively large and somewhat elongated, not perfectly round.  The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, radiating from the center of the plant.\n\n* **Other attributes:** The plant is clump-forming, meaning it grows in a dense cluster. The leaves are smooth and somewhat leathery in texture. The overall shape of the plant is rounded and mounded.  The edges of the leaves are slightly wavy or undulated, not perfectly smooth.  They appear to be growing in mulch.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the plant as Hosta.\n 2. Describe the shape, color, and arrangement of the plant's leaves.\n3. Mention any additional attributes that aid recognition (e.g., environment, leaf pattern).",
