Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a winter ballad on the solitude and muffled world under snow, reflecting life's resilience in a monochrome setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe snow falls soft, a muffled shroud,\nOn streets where life once brightly flowed.\nA monochrome world, hushed and still,\nWhere winter's hand holds all its will.\n\nThe buildings stand, in shades of grey,\nTheir windows veiled, the light astray.\nThe falling flakes, a silent dance,\nObscure the world, a fleeting trance.\n\nA lone man walks, a figure small,\nAgainst the snow, he stands up tall.\nHis breath a mist, his steps slow, deep,\nThrough drifts of white, his secrets keep.\n\nThe world is hushed, a muted scene,\nYet in his heart, a fire keen.\nFor life persists, though winter's cold,\nA story told, a strength untold.\n\nThe snow may fall, the wind may blow,\nBut hope remains, a gentle glow.\nIn shades of white, a world anew,\nResilience blooms, forever true.\n\nThe muffled sounds, the frosted pane,\nA winter's tale, a soft refrain.\nBut through the snow, a spirit bright,\nEndures the dark, and claims the light.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAmidst the snow-covered scene, a man alone walks\nHis solitary steps echo in the crunchy ground\nSilent, muffled, the world around him hushes\nThe snow-muffled world, a monochrome landscape\n\nThe trees and buildings wear a white shroud\nBare branches stretch, reaching out frozen hands\nThe wind howls through the streets, whipped by the snow\nAs the man walks, his footprints swiftly fade away\n\nIn this frozen world, life's resilience lives on\nAmidst the white and grey, a colorless but persistent hue\nA man, though the snow may cover, continues on his way\nEmbracing the cold, the winter's melancholy song he'll sing\n\nIn the end, the snow will melt, and the world revealed\nThe man may find warmth, and perhaps, a heart to mend\nBut until then, in this solitude, he braves the cold\nA lone figure in a silent, snow-muffled world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Includes imagery of solitude, snow's muffled world, and monochrome setting.\n2. Reflects life's resilience in the context of a winter scene.\n3.
