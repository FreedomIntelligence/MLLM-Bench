Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the red berry in the smoothie bowl in the image? How is it different from the dark purple berry in the bowl? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a description of the berries in the smoothie bowl:\n\nThe red berries are raspberries.  Raspberries are characterized by their bright red color, a slightly tart flavor, and their delicate, easily-separating drupelets (the little individual segments).\n\nThe dark purple berries are blackberries. Blackberries are darker in color, almost black, and have a more intense, slightly sweeter flavor than raspberries.  Their drupelets are also more fused together than those of raspberries.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe red berry in the smoothie bowl is the strawberry, whereas the dark purple berry is the acai berry. Both of these berries are included in the smoothie alongside other fruits, such as blueberries, blackberries, and bananas.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the raspberry and describe its color, shape, and texture\n2. Identify the dark purple berry as blackberry.\n3.
