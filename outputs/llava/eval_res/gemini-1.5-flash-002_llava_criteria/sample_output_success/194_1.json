    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm.  Let's break down the components and look for abnormalities:\n\n**ECG Waveform Components:**\n\n* **P wave:** Represents atrial depolarization (contraction).  In this ECG, the P waves are present, upright, and consistent in morphology (shape) preceding each QRS complex.  This indicates normal atrial activation.\n\n* **QRS complex:** Represents ventricular depolarization (contraction). The QRS complexes are narrow (less than 0.12 seconds), indicating normal conduction through the ventricles.  The morphology varies across the leads, which is normal as the electrical activity is viewed from different angles.\n\n* **T wave:** Represents ventricular repolarization (relaxation). The T waves are present and generally follow the QRS complexes.  Their morphology varies across leads, which is expected.  There are no signs of significant T wave inversion or other abnormalities.\n\n* **PR interval:** The time between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex.  It represents the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles.  The PR intervals appear to be within the normal range (0.12-0.20 seconds).\n\n* **QT interval:** The time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. It represents the total duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization.  Visual assessment of the QT interval is difficult without precise measurement tools, but it appears to be within a normal range.  However, a precise measurement would need to be done to confirm this.\n\n\n**Abnormalities:**\n\nBased on a visual inspection, there are **no obvious significant abnormalities** in this ECG.  The rhythm is regular, the P waves are normal, and the QRS complexes are narrow.  There are no signs of ST-segment elevation or depression (which would suggest myocardial ischemia or infarction), and the T waves are not significantly inverted or abnormal.\n\n**Important Note:**  I am an AI and cannot provide a medical diagnosis. This analysis is based solely on visual interpretation of the provided ECG image.  A proper interpretation requires consideration of the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and potentially further investigations.  A qualified healthcare professional should always interpret ECGs and make any necessary diagnoses or treatment decisions.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
