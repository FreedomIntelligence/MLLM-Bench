    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify any cultural or traditional attire and elements present in the scene, and infer the type of ceremony or event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a scene that strongly suggests a traditional West African wedding ceremony, possibly Ghanaian.  Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Cultural Attire:** The groom (or a significant male figure in the ceremony) is wearing a brightly colored Kente cloth, a vibrant and patterned textile that is highly significant in Ghanaian culture.  The bride is wearing a modern, off-the-shoulder gown, but the lower part of her outfit incorporates the Kente cloth design, blending tradition with contemporary style.  The man on the left is wearing a simple, elegant white long-sleeved shirt, a style common in many West African cultures for formal occasions.  The man standing behind the groom is also dressed in a simple white long-sleeved shirt.\n\n* **Ceremony Elements:** The presence of a book (possibly a Bible or a traditional marriage register) and the solemn expressions of those involved suggest a formal exchange of vows or a legal signing of documents. The bride's elaborate hairpiece and the overall formality of the setting further support this interpretation.\n\n* **Inference:**  The combination of traditional Kente cloth, a formal setting, and the presence of a book strongly suggests a wedding ceremony, possibly incorporating both traditional and modern elements.  The groom's Kente cloth is particularly indicative of a Ghanaian cultural context.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are individuals dressed in traditional African attire, particularly a man wearing a kilt and a woman in a colorful dress. They are standing around a table, which indicates a formal event or ceremony. The presence of a cell phone on the table might suggest that the event is being documented or that the attendees are using it for communication. The group of people is engaged in a specific activity, and their attire suggests that the event is culturally or traditionally based.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify attire indicating a wedding; prioritize bright-colored, festive garments and any headpieces.\n2. Describe elements like bouquets or ceremonial objects that suggest a wedding.\n3. Identify the presence of a marriage officer or a religious leader holding a book that suggest a wedding.",
