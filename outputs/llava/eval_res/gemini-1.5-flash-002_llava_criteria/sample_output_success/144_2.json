    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify potential humorous elements within the image, and create a humorous caption for the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are a few humorous caption options for the image of a man speeding on a scooter:\n\n**Option 1 (Playing on speed):**\n\n\"Me, trying to get to the sale before it ends.\"  or \"My commute.  Arrive late, or arrive dramatically.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Self-deprecating):**\n\n\"This is my 'I haven't worked out in months' workout.\" or \"Adulting is hard.  This is my 'adulting' transportation.\"\n\n\n**Option 3 (Exaggerated):**\n\n\"Faster than a speeding bullet... well, maybe a slightly slower bullet.\" or \"Breaking the sound barrier... one tiny scooter wheel at a time.\"\n\n**Option 4 (Referencing the backpack):**\n\n\"Carrying the weight of the world... one scooter ride at a time.\" or \"My escape plan.  (Contents of backpack: snacks, extra socks, and a slightly deflated ego).\"\n\n\n**Option 5 (Simple & Sweet):**\n\n\"Scootin' on outta here!\"\n\n\nThe humor comes from the contrast between the man's serious expression and the relatively mundane activity of scooter riding,  exaggerated speed, and the relatable situations implied in some of the captions.  The motion blur adds to the comedic effect.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humorous element in the image is the man with a backpack on his back seemingly having trouble balancing on the small scooter. Riding a scooter could be challenging, especially if the man is not used to it. The fact that the man is wearing a backpack might also add a playful element to the scene, as he rides quickly down the street, possibly struggling to maintain his balance.\n\nA humorous caption for this image could be: \"The man with the backpack races to catch the bus, but the scooter might not be fast enough to keep up with his schedule.\"\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes a humorous take on the adult riding a child's scooter.\n2. Humor relates to the contrast between the rider's intense expression and the playful activity.\n3. Caption is creative, contextually relevant to the image, and evokes amusement.",
