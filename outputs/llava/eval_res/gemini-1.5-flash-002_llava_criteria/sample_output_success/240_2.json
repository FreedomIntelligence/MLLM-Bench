    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical characteristics that are typical for the species and breeds of the animals in the image, such as coat type and ear shape\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a comparison of the physical characteristics of the animals in the image:\n\n**1. Jack Russell Terrier Puppy:**\n\n* **Coat Type:** Short, smooth, and dense.  It's predominantly white with tan markings on its head and above its eyes.\n* **Ear Shape:**  V-shaped, dropping down at the sides of the head, but not fully folded over.\n\n\n**2. Maine Coon Kitten:**\n\n* **Coat Type:** Long, thick, and shaggy.  The kitten shown is a reddish-brown or ginger color with lighter underfur.  Maine Coons are known for their impressive coats.\n* **Ear Shape:** Large, tufted ears that are slightly pointed at the tips.\n\n\n**3. Labrador Retriever Puppy:**\n\n* **Coat Type:** Short, dense, and slightly wavy.  The puppy is a light cream or pale yellow color.\n* **Ear Shape:**  Medium-sized, floppy ears that hang down close to the head.  They are typically soft and rounded.\n\n\nIn summary, the three animals showcase a variety of coat lengths and textures, and distinct ear shapes typical of their respective breeds.  The differences highlight the breed-specific traits that distinguish these popular pets.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features three puppies and a kitten, showcasing a mix of species and breeds. The puppies present in the image can be characterized by their furry coats and dog-like features, such as pointy ears and a muzzle. The cat, on the other hand, is characterized by its sleek, furry coat, large pointy ears, and, of course, a more elongated body. The ears of the dogs are pointed upwards, which is a typical characteristic of many dog breeds, whereas the cat has large, pointed ears, which is a more cat-like feature. By comparing these physical characteristics, one can appreciate the differences between the animals and their respective species and breeds.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare coat types: smooth white with tan patches, fluffy long-haired, soft short cream-colored.\n2. Compare ear shapes: partially folded, pointed and floppy.",
