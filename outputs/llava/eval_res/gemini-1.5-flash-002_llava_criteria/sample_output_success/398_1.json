    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a series of figures in chronological order. What is the trend of change in the predicted graph? Explain the reasons for this trend of change.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph is that the waistline of the figures gradually increases from one figure to the next. This represents the accumulation of extra fat over time, which is a common concern in the context of obesity. The series of figures, each showing a person wearing blue shorts and a spaghetti-string top, are used to explain the consequences of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in obesity and its related health problems. This sequence is a visual representation of the potential health risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe trend shown in the image is a progressive increase in body weight and body fat percentage over time for both the male and female figures.  The figures are arranged chronologically, showing a gradual increase in size and a decrease in muscle definition.\n\nThe reason for this trend is likely to depict the effects of **unhealthy lifestyle choices** over time.  This could include factors such as:\n\n* **Poor diet:** Consuming excessive calories, particularly from processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats, leads to weight gain.\n* **Lack of physical activity:** Insufficient exercise prevents the body from burning calories and maintaining a healthy metabolism.\n* **Sedentary lifestyle:** Spending long periods sitting or being inactive further contributes to weight gain.\n\nThe image visually represents how these factors can cumulatively lead to significant weight gain and changes in body composition, going from a fit and healthy appearance to an obese appearance.  It's important to note that this is a simplified representation and individual experiences can vary.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer recognizes the trend of increasing body weight.\n2. Assess the explanation for the rising trend, relating to the figures' changes.\n3. Confirm the answer follows a chronological analysis of the figures.",
