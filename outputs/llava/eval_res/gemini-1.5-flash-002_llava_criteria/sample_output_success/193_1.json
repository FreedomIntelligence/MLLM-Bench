    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the type of cells pointed by labeled arrows.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows cells with labeled arrows pointing to them, likely indicating specific features or characteristics of the cells. However, without additional context or specific descriptions of the cells, it is difficult to definitively determine the type of cells pointed by the labeled arrows. The cells could be red blood cells, white blood cells, or any other type of cell in the context of a microscope slide.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a description of the cells indicated by the arrows in the image:\n\n* **A:**  This is a **lymphocyte**.  Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune system.  They are relatively small and have a large, round nucleus that takes up most of the cell.\n\n* **B:** This is a **neutrophil**. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell and are part of the innate immune system. They have a multi-lobed nucleus (often 3-5 lobes) and a granular cytoplasm.\n\n* **C:** This is a **monocyte**. Monocytes are another type of white blood cell. They are larger than lymphocytes and have a kidney-shaped or indented nucleus.  They are precursors to macrophages.\n\n* **D:** This is a **basophil**. Basophils are a type of granulocyte white blood cell.  They are characterized by large, dark-staining granules that obscure the nucleus.\n\n* **E:** This is a **lymphocyte**.  Similar in appearance to A.\n\n* **F:** This is a **lymphocyte**. Similar in appearance to A and E.\n\n* **G:** This is a **neutrophil**. Similar in appearance to B.\n\n* **H:** This appears to be a **platelet**. Platelets are much smaller than the other cells shown and are involved in blood clotting.  They are fragments of megakaryocytes.\n\n\nIt's important to note that identifying blood cells from images can be challenging, and this identification is based on the visual characteristics of the cells in the provided image.  A definitive identification would require more sophisticated analysis.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify and match each labeled arrow (A-H) with the cell types from the reference.\n2. Answer must specify the type of cell for each label without ambiguity or error.",
