    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that not only describes what is seen but also evokes the other senses, such as the smell of the fresh peaches or the taste of the jam, to create a multi-sensory experience.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a large woven basket filled with a variety of ripe peaches, placed beside a wooden table. Their colors range from vibrant reds to deep oranges, and they appear to be fresh and juicy. The basket, which seems to be handmade, lends a rustic charm to the scene. Next to the basket, there is a white ceramic jar filled with a sweet, homemade jam. The aroma of the peaches entices the senses, while the taste of the jam offers a delightful contrast to the freshness of the fruit. The combination of these elements creates a delightful and nostalgia-inducing experience that captures the essence of a sunny summer day spent outdoors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are a few caption options for the image, aiming for a multi-sensory experience:\n\n**Option 1 (More poetic):**\n\n\"Sun-drenched apricots, their velvety skins hinting at the sweet juice within.  The scent of ripe fruit mingles with the rich, syrupy aroma of homemade jam, a taste of summer preserved in amber glass.  The warmth of the wood, the whisper of leaves – a still life brimming with the bounty of harvest.\"\n\n\n**Option 2 (More descriptive):**\n\n\"A rustic still life: plump apricots, their downy fuzz almost visible, spill from a woven basket beside a jar of glistening apricot jam. The sweet, tangy fragrance hangs heavy in the air, promising a taste of sunshine and summer's end.  The rough texture of the wooden barrel adds a grounding element to this scene of sun-kissed abundance.\"\n\n\n**Option 3 (Shorter and sweeter):**\n\n\"The scent of summer lingers – ripe apricots, their sweetness captured in a jar of homemade jam. A taste of sunshine, preserved.\"\n\n\n**Option 4 (Focus on the contrast):**\n\n\"The dark background throws the vibrant hues of the apricots and the rich amber of the jam into sharp relief.  Imagine the contrast between the smooth, cool skin of the fruit and the warm, syrupy sweetness of the jam. A feast for the senses.\"\n\n\nChoose the caption that best suits your desired tone and audience.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes visual description of peaches, jam jar, and setting.\n2. Caption evokes sense of smell (e.g., fresh peaches) and taste (e.g., sweet jam).\n3. Caption is coherent, creates a multi-sensory experience, and aligns with the image.",
