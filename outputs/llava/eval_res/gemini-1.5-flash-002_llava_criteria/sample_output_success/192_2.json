    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**CT Head Report**\n\n**Findings:**\n\nThe non-contrast CT scan of the head demonstrates a large, well-circumscribed, hypodense mass in the right parietal lobe.  The mass measures approximately [estimate the size in cm;  e.g., 6 x 5 x 4 cm] and shows significant mass effect with midline shift to the left.  There is associated edema surrounding the lesion.  No significant hemorrhage is identified within the mass itself.  There is evidence of small areas of hypoattenuation in the left frontal lobe, which could represent small areas of ischemia or artifact.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or subdural/epidural hematoma is identified.  The ventricles are compressed.  The skull bones appear unremarkable.\n\n**Impression:**\n\nThe imaging findings are most consistent with a large right parietal lobe mass.  The differential diagnosis includes a large meningioma, glioblastoma, or metastatic lesion.  Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI is recommended for better characterization of the lesion and to assist in determining the etiology.  Given the size and mass effect, neurosurgical consultation is recommended for consideration of treatment options.\n\n\n**Note:** This report is based solely on the provided image and is for illustrative purposes only.  A definitive diagnosis requires correlation with clinical findings and additional imaging studies.  Measurements are estimates and should be verified by the radiologist reviewing the original images.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
