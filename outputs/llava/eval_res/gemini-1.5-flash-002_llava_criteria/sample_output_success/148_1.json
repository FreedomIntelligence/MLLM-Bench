    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image lies in the juxtaposition of the text \"MONDAYS...\" and the cat's posture.\n\n* **The Cat's Posture:** The cat is curled up into a tight ball, its face hidden, suggesting dejection, sadness, or reluctance. This is a relatable posture for many people who feel similarly about Mondays – the start of the work week.\n\n* **The Text:** The simple, capitalized \"MONDAYS...\" sets the context. The ellipsis (...) adds to the feeling of drawn-out misery and resignation associated with the start of the work week.\n\nThe joke works because it uses anthropomorphism – attributing human emotions to an animal.  The cat's body language perfectly mirrors the common human feeling of dread or exhaustion associated with the beginning of the work week, creating a humorous and relatable image.  The simplicity of the meme enhances the impact.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
