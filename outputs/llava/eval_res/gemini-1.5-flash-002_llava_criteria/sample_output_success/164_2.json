Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven an image of an e-mail, determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe author's primary intention is to inform the recipient of three urgent political updates, emphasizing the Democrats' apparent advantages in upcoming special elections and fundraising, as well as the precariousness of the Republican House majority.
