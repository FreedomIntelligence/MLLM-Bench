    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image depicts a humorous take on human evolution, showing a progression from ape to modern human.  The trend is one of increasing technological dependence and a corresponding decrease in physical activity and self-reliance.\n\nThe next stage could be depicted in several ways, all maintaining the theme of technological advancement and its impact on humanity:\n\n* **Complete Dependence:** A figure slumped over, completely immersed in a virtual reality headset or a sophisticated technological device, perhaps even with atrophied limbs from lack of use. This would highlight the potential for excessive reliance on technology.\n\n* **Technological Symbiosis:** A figure with some sort of technological augmentation, perhaps implanted devices or cybernetic enhancements, blurring the line between human and machine. This would represent a future where technology is integrated into our very being.\n\n* **Isolation and Mental Health:** A figure alone, surrounded by technology but visibly lonely or depressed, highlighting the potential negative consequences of social isolation in a technology-driven world.\n\n* **Environmental Degradation:** A figure surrounded by the detritus of advanced technology, showing a possible dystopian future where technological progress has come at the cost of environmental sustainability.\n\n\nThe choice of the next stage depends on the intended message.  The humorous tone of the original image might lean toward the first option (complete dependence), while a more serious interpretation could opt for the latter options.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
