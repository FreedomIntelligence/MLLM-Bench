    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the foods on the table detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe table features a plate full of food, which includes meat, bread, greens, and a salad. There are several pieces of bread, some of which are of different sizes. A bowl of sauce is also present on the table. Additionally, there's a donut on the table, slightly separated from the main plate of food.\n\nIn the background, a stuffed teddy bear is sitting next to the plate. The dining table occupies most of the scene, setting a casual atmosphere for enjoying the meal.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a description of the foods on the table:\n\nThe plate features a variety of fried items arranged artfully.  There are several pieces of crispy, golden-brown fried chicken wings, exhibiting a slightly glossy sheen from the cooking oil.  Next to them is a pile of lighter-colored, deep-fried items that appear to be battered and possibly squid or other seafood, showing a similar crisp texture.  A small amount of dark, possibly grilled or blackened, food is visible beneath the chicken wings.  In the background, a handful of thin, irregularly shaped, crispy fried snacks, potentially prawn crackers or similar, are piled up.  A sprig of fresh parsley is placed decoratively amongst the fried foods.\n\nAccompanying the fried items are two small white bowls. One contains a vibrant yellow mustard-based dipping sauce, showing a slightly creamy consistency. The other bowl holds a dark reddish-brown, finely ground spice blend, possibly a chili powder or a similar seasoning mix.  The overall presentation suggests a snack or appetizer platter.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe all visible food items, including chicken wings and chili powder.\n2. Mention textures or colors where relevant to the description of the foods.",
