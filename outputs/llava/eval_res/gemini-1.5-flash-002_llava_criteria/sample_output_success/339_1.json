    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe computer screen has sustained significant damage.  There's a spiderweb pattern of cracks radiating from a central point, indicating a strong impact.  The cracks extend across a large portion of the screen's surface.  The damage is severe enough that the screen is likely unusable, and the display may be distorted or completely black.\n\nPossible repair options:\n\n* **Screen Replacement:** This is the most likely solution.  The damaged screen will need to be completely replaced with a new one.  This will require professional repair, either by a certified repair shop or the manufacturer.  The cost will depend on the model of the computer and the availability of replacement parts.\n\n* **Repair Attempt (Not Recommended):**  While some minor cracks might be repaired with specialized adhesives, the extent of the damage in this image makes a DIY repair extremely unlikely to succeed and likely to cause further damage.  Attempting a DIY repair could void any warranty.\n\n\n**In summary:**  Due to the severity of the damage, a professional screen replacement is the only viable and recommended repair option.  Contacting the manufacturer or a reputable repair shop for a quote is the next step.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the extent and location of the screen damage.\n2. Suggest realistic repair methods for the identified damage.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the instruction's focus on evaluation and repair.",
