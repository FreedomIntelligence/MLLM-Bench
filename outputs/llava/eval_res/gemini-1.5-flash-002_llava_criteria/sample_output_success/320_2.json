    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the image quality, and determine the possible cause of the blurriness.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality is poor; it's blurry and lacks detail.  The blurriness is likely due to one or more of the following factors:\n\n* **Motion blur:** This is the most probable cause in an underwater photo.  Even slight movement of the camera (either from the photographer's hand or underwater currents affecting the camera housing) will result in significant blurring, especially when shooting in relatively low light conditions.\n\n* **Low light conditions:** Underwater, light diminishes rapidly with depth.  This can lead to the camera increasing its ISO (sensitivity to light), resulting in increased noise and potentially blurriness.  A slow shutter speed would also be necessary to gather enough light, increasing the likelihood of motion blur.\n\n* **Water conditions:**  Turbid water (water with suspended particles) will scatter light, reducing clarity and sharpness.\n\n* **Lens limitations:** The quality of the camera lens itself could contribute to some blurriness, though this is less likely to be the primary cause given the overall level of blur.  The lens might not be optimally focused, or the camera's autofocus system might have had difficulty focusing in the low-light conditions.\n\n* **Camera settings:** Incorrect settings like a too-wide aperture (low f-stop number) could contribute to a lack of sharpness, but it's more likely the motion blur and low light are the main culprits.\n\nIn summary, the most likely cause is a combination of motion blur from camera movement and the challenges of capturing a sharp image in underwater low-light conditions.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image quality is poor, with a lot of blurriness due to the fuzzy coral and an unclear underwater view. There are many factors that could contribute to poor image quality, including the distance from the subject, camera settings, water clarity, or even the condition of the camera itself. The blurriness may not allow for a detailed examination of the coral reef structure, which could provide valuable information about marine life and ecosystems. It is essential to ensure that future underwater images are of high quality for more accurate identification and understanding of marine environments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess sharpness and clarity; mention if image details are distinguishable.\n2. Identify potential causes of blurriness, such as camera motion or water distortion.\n3. Evaluate color fidelity and noise levels, considering underwater lighting conditions.",
