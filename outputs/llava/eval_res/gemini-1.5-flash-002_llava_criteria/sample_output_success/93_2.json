    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I want to find similar photos like this on social media, for which sections or hashtags should I search?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo find similar photos on social media, you should search using a combination of location-based hashtags and descriptive keywords.  Here's a suggested approach:\n\n**Location Hashtags:**  The image appears to be in Amalfi Coast, Italy.  Use these hashtags (and variations):\n\n* #AmalfiCoast\n* #Amalfi\n* #Positano (if you think it's Positano, it's very similar in style)\n* #Italy\n* #SouthernItaly\n* #Campania (the region)\n* #ItalianCoast\n* #Mediterranean\n\n**Descriptive Hashtags:** These hashtags will capture the visual aspects of the photo:\n\n* #ItalianVillage\n* #ItalianStreet\n* #SunsetinItaly\n* #EveninginItaly\n* #TravelItaly\n* #Travelgram\n* #Instatravel\n* #VacationMode\n* #RomanticItaly\n* #EuropeanTravel\n* #TravelPhotography\n* #StreetPhotography\n* #ArchitecturePhotography\n* #Cityscape\n* #OldTown\n* #CharmingTown\n* #MediterraneanVibes\n\n\n**Advanced Search Strategies:**\n\n* **Combine location and descriptive hashtags:** For example,  `#AmalfiCoast #SunsetinItaly #ItalianVillage`\n* **Use location tagging:** If you know the exact location, tag it directly in your search.  Many social media platforms allow searching by location.\n* **Search for specific landmarks:** If you can identify the church in the background, include its name in your search.\n* **Explore related hashtags:** When you find a relevant post, check its hashtags and explore those as well.  This can lead you to more niche and relevant results.\n* **Use image search:** Some platforms (like Google Images or Pinterest) allow reverse image searches. Upload the photo to find visually similar images.\n\n\nBy combining location-specific and descriptive hashtags, you will significantly increase your chances of finding similar photos on social media platforms. Remember to experiment with different combinations to refine your results.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo find similar photos on social media, you can search for the following sections or hashtags:\n\n1. #cityscape: This hashtag is commonly used for urban scenes, including busy streets and surrounding buildings.\n2. #citylife: Similar to #cityscape, this hashtag represents urban life and city dwellers going about their daily activities.\n3. #eveningwalk: Use this hashtag if you're looking for images of people walking in the evening, which might include the same setting as this image, such as a couple walking down a city street.\n4. #nightwalk: This hashtag is suitable if you want to find photos that depict people walking at night in cities, which can be another suitable context for the image.\n\nBy searching for these hashtags on platforms like Instagram or Twitter, you'll likely come across similar photos capturing the bustling atmosphere of city streets, with people walking or engaging in various activities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style, cultural elements, or geographical features.\n2. Suggest relevant hashtags or sections for similar content.\n3. Ensure suggestions are specific to the image, not generic terms.",
