    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the visual symptoms in detail and estimate the stage of the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a young child is looking at the camera with red spots on their skin, particularly on their face. These red spots are likely indicative of a rash or an outbreak of hives. Hives are often caused by an allergic reaction, irritation, or an infection. It is difficult to precisely determine the stage of the condition from the image alone, as the severity, size, and distribution of the rash can vary. However, given that the child is looking at the camera, it is possible that the rash is not too severe or extensive, allowing the child to maintain focus and comfort in the presence of the photographer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a toddler with a rash primarily affecting the cheeks and possibly spreading to the neck.  The rash is characterized by:\n\n* **Erythema (redness):**  The skin is significantly reddened, particularly on the cheeks.\n* **Maculopapular lesions:** The redness appears as flat (macules) and slightly raised (papules) spots.  They are not clearly defined, blending into the surrounding redness.\n* **Distribution:** The rash is concentrated on the cheeks, but there's a suggestion of spread towards the neck and possibly other areas not fully visible in the image.\n\n**Estimating the Stage:** Without more information (e.g., fever, other symptoms, duration), it's impossible to definitively diagnose the condition or stage. However, the appearance suggests a possible early stage of a viral exanthem (rash).  Several viral illnesses, such as fifth disease (erythema infectiosum) or measles, present with similar initial facial flushing and maculopapular rash.\n\n**Important Note:** This is a visual assessment only.  A proper diagnosis requires a medical examination by a healthcare professional.  The rash could be caused by various conditions, some requiring immediate medical attention.  If the child shows other symptoms like fever, lethargy, difficulty breathing, or the rash is spreading rapidly, seek immediate medical help.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe visible skin symptoms (e.g., rash, discoloration).\n2. Estimate condition stage based on visual symptoms severity.\n3. Include no diagnosis, focus on symptom description and stage estimation.",
