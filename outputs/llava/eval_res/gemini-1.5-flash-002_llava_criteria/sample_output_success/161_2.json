Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, summarize the abstract in one sentence and explain the significance of this article.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere is a one-sentence summary of the abstract and an explanation of the article's significance:\n\n**Summary:** The paper introduces \"Phoenix,\" a large open-source language model that achieves competitive performance with English and Chinese models while excelling in low-resource languages, aiming to democratize access to ChatGPT globally.\n\n**Significance:** This article is significant because it addresses the accessibility limitations of ChatGPT, particularly in regions with restricted access or limited resources. By releasing a competitive open-source model, the researchers aim to promote inclusivity and enable broader use of advanced language technologies, thereby potentially fostering innovation and development in various fields worldwide.  The availability of the data, code, and models further enhances the impact by allowing others to build upon and improve the work.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe abstract describes a paper that highlights the importance of democratizing chatbot development by incorporating multiple languages, including English and Chinese, to allow chatbots to communicate with users across diverse linguistic backgrounds. This can be achieved by using innovative models such as Phoenix, which can enhance the performance of chatbots while reducing the learning time required. The significance of this article lies in promoting the use of chatbots in various languages, thus providing universal access and fostering global connections.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Summarize the abstract in one sentence, mentioning 'Phoenix', 'democratize ChatGPT', and 'languages'.\n2. Explain the significance, focusing on accessibility in 'resource-limited' areas and 'non-Latin languages'.",
