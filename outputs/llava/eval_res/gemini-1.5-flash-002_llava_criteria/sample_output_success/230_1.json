Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nList all models that have pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere is no direct information provided in the image about the specific models with pre-training support for both Spanish and Chinese. However, the image states that \"German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Italian, and Portuguese\" are among the languages supported by the models. This suggests that the models likely have pre-training support for a mix of languages, but the image does not provide a detailed list of which languages have such support.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the provided table, the models with pre-training support (♥) for both Spanish and Chinese are:  None.\n\nWhile some models have post-training support (♠) for both languages,  none show pre-training support for both.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List must include BELLE and Phoenix as they include both Spanish and Chinese during pre-training.",
