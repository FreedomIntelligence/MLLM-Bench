    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis meme uses several elements of humor to create its comedic effect:\n\n* **Irony:** The core humor stems from the irony of the situation.  A woman expresses her hatred of dogs, yet the next panel shows a large, adorable Shiba Inu (a popular dog breed) sitting in the car, seemingly accepted by the man.  The juxtaposition of her statement with the reality of the situation is inherently ironic.\n\n* **Unexpectedness/Surprise:** The sudden appearance of the large Shiba Inu is unexpected, breaking the established context. This element of surprise contributes significantly to the humor.\n\n* **Absurdity:** The sheer size of the Shiba Inu in the car, and its seemingly calm acceptance by the driver, is absurd and unrealistic.  This absurdity adds to the comedic effect.\n\n* **Visual Humor:** The meme's style, a pop-art-like comic strip, enhances the humor. The exaggerated features of the characters and the clear distinction between the panels contribute to the overall comedic tone.\n\n* **Memetic Humor:** The inclusion of the \"This is the way!\" phrase and the NAFO/OFAN logo (associated with online pro-Ukraine communities) adds a layer of memetic humor. This will only be fully understood by those familiar with these online communities and their associated memes. This leverages pre-existing humor and cultural references.\n\n\nThe overall type of humor is primarily **ironic**, but it also incorporates elements of **absurd humor** and **visual humor**.  The memetic elements add another layer of context and humor for those familiar with the online culture it references.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
