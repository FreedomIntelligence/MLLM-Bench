    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nConsidering her attire and appearance, could you discern the profession or occupation of the individual in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the individual is dressed as a firefighter, wearing a fire helmet, a yellow and red uniform, and carrying a toy fire hose. The profession or occupation of the person in the picture is most likely a firefighter, as their attire, appearance, and the toy equipment they are carrying are indicative of their role in the field.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the individual is clearly **not** a firefighter.  The child is wearing a firefighter costume, including a helmet, vest, and toy water gun.  Therefore, their profession or occupation cannot be discerned from the image; it's purely a costume.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer should infer that the individual is a kid, based on the reference provided.\n2. Answer should infer that the kid is roleplaying a firefighter.",
