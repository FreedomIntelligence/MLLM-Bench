    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the facial expression of the woman in the picture and explain how you get your conclusion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman in the picture has a smiling facial expression with her eyes open wide. Her lips are slightly parted, revealing her teeth, and her eyelashes are fluttering. The combination of her eyes, lips, and teeth creates a warm, joyful, and inviting demeanor. This facial expression conveys a positive and friendly impression, which suggests that she is happy and comfortable in the moment captured in the photo.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman in the picture is displaying a happy expression.  This conclusion is based on several visual cues:\n\n* **Upward Turned Mouth Corners:** Her mouth is curved upwards at the corners, a classic indicator of a smile and happiness.\n* **Eye Muscles:** The muscles around her eyes are slightly crinkled, creating what are often called \"crow's feet.\" This is a genuine smile, not a forced one, as forced smiles typically don't involve the eye muscles.\n* **Overall Facial Expression:** The overall arrangement of her facial features contributes to an impression of joy and contentment.  There's no evidence of sadness, anger, or any other negative emotion.\n\nThe combination of these features strongly suggests that the woman is feeling happy and content.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's facial expression as a smile, referencing the mouth and corners of her eyes.\n2. Explain the recognition process, mentioning visible teeth and eye crinkles.\n",
