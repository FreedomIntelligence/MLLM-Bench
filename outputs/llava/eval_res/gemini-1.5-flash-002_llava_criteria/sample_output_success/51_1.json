    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the building in the picture? To which period can its construction be traced back to?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe building in the picture is an ancient, large, and historic structure, likely a castle or a fortress. Its construction can be traced back to the Xi'an period in China, which dates back to around the 11th century. It has a unique design, featuring a high stone wall lining its side and a distinctive stepped appearance. The steepness of the wall and its impressive height make it a fascinating sight and a testament to the architectural and engineering prowess of the time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThat's a section of the Great Wall of China.\n\nConstruction of the Great Wall spanned many centuries, with significant work done during various dynasties.  The sections visible in the image are primarily from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).  While earlier walls existed in the area, the Ming Dynasty undertook extensive repairs, rebuilding, and expansion of the wall, resulting in much of what we see today.  Therefore, while the location has a history going back much further, the specific structures shown in the picture are primarily from the **Ming Dynasty period**.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the building as the Great Wall.\n2. Trace the construction period back to the 7th century BC (Spring and Autumn period).",
