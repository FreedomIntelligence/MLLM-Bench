    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that captures the duality of the character's persona as portrayed by the face paint overlaying the natural expression, reflecting the contrast between the facade and the individual's true self.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are a few caption options to capture the duality of the character's persona, as shown in the image:\n\n**Option 1 (Short & Punchy):**\n\n> The mask hides, but the eyes reveal.\n\n**Option 2 (More Descriptive):**\n\n> A painted smile can't conceal the storm brewing beneath.  The facade and the man within, forever intertwined.\n\n**Option 3 (Poetic):**\n\n>  Beneath the clown's grim visage, a soul struggles to break free.  A tragic dance between performance and reality.\n\n**Option 4 (Intriguing):**\n\n>  Is it the makeup, or is it the madness that truly defines him?  The line blurs, the truth remains hidden.\n\n**Option 5 (Direct & Empathetic):**\n\n>  He wears a mask, but the pain is undeniable.  A portrait of fractured identity.\n\n\nChoose the caption that best suits the overall tone and style you're aiming for.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe face of the Joker, with his red, white, and blue makeup, is overlaid with a face that reflects his true self, creating a compelling contrast between the persona and the individual's genuine thoughts and emotions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption identifies the contrast between face paint and natural expression.\n2. Caption reflects the concept of duality in the character's persona.\n3. Caption is coherent and contextually relevant to the image.",
