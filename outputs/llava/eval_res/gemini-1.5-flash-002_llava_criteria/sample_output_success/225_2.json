    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the linear flow of energy in these food chains.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a description of the linear flow of energy in the provided food chains:\n\n**Food Chain 1 (Trees → Deer → Lion):**\n\nEnergy flows from the trees (producers), which convert sunlight into chemical energy through photosynthesis.  Deer (primary consumers) eat the trees, obtaining energy stored in the plant tissues.  Lions (secondary consumers) then consume the deer, acquiring energy from the deer's tissues.  The energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next.\n\n**Food Chain 2 (Flower → Flies → Frog → Snake → Eagle):**\n\nEnergy begins with the flower (producer), which produces energy through photosynthesis. Flies (primary consumers) feed on the flower's nectar and pollen. Frogs (secondary consumers) eat the flies. Snakes (tertiary consumers) eat the frogs. Finally, eagles (quaternary consumers) prey on the snakes.  Again, energy is transferred sequentially through the food chain.\n\n\n**Food Chain 3 (Flower → Small Fishes → Larger Fish → Birds):**\n\nThis aquatic food chain starts with the flower (producer), which provides energy to the ecosystem, likely through decaying matter that sustains small fishes (primary consumers).  Larger fish (secondary consumers) feed on the smaller fish.  Birds (tertiary consumers) then prey on the larger fish, completing the energy transfer.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays several food chains, showing the linear flow of energy from plants to animals. These food chains include a carnivorous plant, such as a Venus flytrap and an aquatic plant like a water lily, both of which consume smaller organisms as their primary food source. The linear flow of energy is evident as the smaller organisms, such as insects or small fish, are consumed by larger organisms, like predators or carnivorous plants. The larger organisms, in turn, may be preyed upon by even larger animals, like lions or eagles. The image emphasizes the interconnection and dependency of various species in the ecosystem and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and healthy environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The first chain: trees -> deers -> lion\n2. The second chain: flower -> flies -> frog -> snake -> eagle.\n3. The third chain: flower -> small fishes -> larger fish -> birds.\n4. There is no strict format in describing each chain. However, the answer should explicitly and accurately points out every element on each chain.",
