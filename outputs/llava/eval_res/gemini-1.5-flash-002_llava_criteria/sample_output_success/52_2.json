    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat famous festivals or cultural events are often held around the landmark in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat's Mount Fuji reflected in Lake Kawaguchiko.  Several festivals and events are held around Lake Kawaguchiko, often timed to coincide with the changing seasons and the beauty of Mount Fuji:\n\n* **Fuji Shibazakura Festival:** This festival celebrates the blooming of the moss phlox (shibazakura) flowers in a vast field at the foot of Mount Fuji.  It typically takes place in late April to mid-May.\n\n* **Autumn Leaf Viewing:**  Lake Kawaguchiko is a popular spot for autumn leaf viewing, with many events and activities related to the changing colors of the foliage in the surrounding area.  This typically occurs in October and November.\n\n* **Fuji Rock Festival (not directly at Lake Kawaguchiko):** While not directly at Lake Kawaguchiko, this large-scale music festival is held in Naeba Ski Resort, and many attendees stay in the Lake Kawaguchiko area due to proximity and lodging options.\n\n* **Various Fireworks Displays:** Throughout the year, there are often fireworks displays held near the lake, often tied to specific holidays or events.\n\nIt's important to note that specific dates and events vary from year to year, so checking local tourism websites closer to your travel dates is recommended for the most up-to-date information.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the picture, the landmark is a large mountain situated beside a lake. It is not clear from the image which specific landmark or country it is, but in many cultures, such landmarks are often used as a backdrop for religious, cultural, or traditional festivals. Some examples of famous festivals held around such scenic locations include the New Year's Eve celebrations at the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Buddha Light Illumination Festival in Japan, where participants gather to celebrate and appreciate the beauty of their surroundings. These events often bring people together to mark significant occasions, relax, and enjoy the stunning natural scenery around them.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
