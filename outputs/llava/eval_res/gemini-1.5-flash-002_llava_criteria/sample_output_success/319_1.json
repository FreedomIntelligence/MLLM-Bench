    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the answer to this expression?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe expression shown on the paper involves a calculation of the determinant for a 2x2 matrix, which requires a little more information to determine the answer definitively. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndet(A) = a\\_11 \\* a\\_22 - a\\_12 \\* a\\_21\n\nIn this case, it is not possible to provide the exact answer without the values of the elements of the 2x2 matrix. To find the determinant, you need to know the specific values of a\\_11, a\\_12, a\\_21, and a\\_22.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's how to solve the integral:\n\n**1. Simplify the integrand:**\n\nThe expression can be rewritten as:\n\n∫ 2x / [(x + 1)(x² + 1)²] dx\n\n**2. Partial Fraction Decomposition:**\n\nThis integral requires partial fraction decomposition.  Because the denominator has a repeated quadratic factor (x² + 1)², the decomposition will be more complex than usual.  The general form will look like this:\n\n2x / [(x + 1)(x² + 1)²] = A/(x + 1) + (Bx + C)/(x² + 1) + (Dx + E)/(x² + 1)²\n\nTo find A, B, C, D, and E, you'll need to:\n\n* Multiply both sides by the denominator [(x + 1)(x² + 1)²]\n* Expand and equate coefficients of the powers of x.  This will give you a system of five linear equations with five unknowns.\n* Solve the system of equations (this is often the most tedious part).\n\n**3. Integrate the Partial Fractions:**\n\nOnce you have the partial fraction decomposition, you'll integrate each term separately.  The terms with (x² + 1) in the denominator will likely involve trigonometric substitutions or other advanced techniques.\n\n**4. Combine and Simplify:**\n\nFinally, combine the results of the individual integrations and simplify your answer.\n\n**Important Note:**  The partial fraction decomposition and subsequent integration are quite involved.  Solving this by hand is lengthy and error-prone.  It's highly recommended to use a computer algebra system (like Wolfram Alpha, Mathematica, or similar software) to perform the partial fraction decomposition and integration.  These tools can handle the complex algebra and calculus much more efficiently.  Simply input the original integral into the system to get the solution.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly solve the integral expression shown in the image.\n2. Matches answer: 2*(x - 1)/(4*x**2 + 4) - log(x + 1)/2 + log(x**2 + 1)/4.\n3. Explanation is mathematically sound and aligns with visual math reasoning.",
