    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis is a **Collared Aracari** *(Pteroglossus torquatus)*.  Here's a detailed description to aid in identification:\n\n**Size and Shape:**  A medium-sized toucan, roughly the size of a large pigeon.  Its body is relatively long and slender compared to some other toucans, with a long, slightly decurved bill. The tail is relatively long and square-ended.\n\n**Bill:** The bill is a striking feature.  It's predominantly black, but the base of the upper mandible (the top part of the bill) is a bright yellowish-orange.  There's a noticeable, small, pale band near the tip of the upper mandible. The lower mandible (bottom) is also black. The bill is large relative to the bird's body but less massive than some other toucan species.\n\n**Head and Neck:** The head is mostly black.  A striking feature is the bright blue skin around the eye.  The throat and upper breast are a vibrant, bright yellow.  There's a narrow, reddish-orange band separating the yellow throat from the rest of the breast.\n\n**Body:** The breast and belly are a rich, reddish-orange color.  The back and wings are predominantly black.\n\n**Legs and Feet:** The feet are zygodactyl (two toes point forward and two point backward), typical of many tree-dwelling birds, allowing for a strong grip on branches. The feet are dark in color.\n\n**Overall Coloration:** The combination of the black, blue, yellow, and reddish-orange creates a very distinctive and visually appealing pattern.\n\n**Behavior:** Collared Aracaris are typically found in the canopy of forests and are arboreal (live in trees). They are often seen in pairs or small groups.  They are relatively active and vocal.\n\n**Habitat:**  They inhabit humid lowland forests, often near rivers or streams.\n\nBy combining these features of size, bill shape and color, head markings (blue eye ring and yellow throat), breast and belly coloration (reddish-orange), and the black back and wings, one can confidently identify this bird as a Collared Aracari.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal is a colorful bird with a striking appearance. It has a black and orange body, a white head, blue eyes, and a long beak. The bird's beak is quite large, and it seems to be stretching or yawning its mouth while perched on a tree branch. The bird's vibrant colors and unique features make it easily distinguishable and visually interesting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention toucans' large, colorful bills as a distinctive feature.\n2. Describe additional attributes: body color, size, and any unique markings.\n3. Include the setting or behavior if it aids in recognition.",
