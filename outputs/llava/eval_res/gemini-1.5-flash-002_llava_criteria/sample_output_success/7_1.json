    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the hands of the anime character and briefly describe the use and techniques of this object.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe anime character is holding a trombone, which is a musical instrument used to produce sound by vibrating the air inside it. The trombone is made of a long metal tube, with a flared bell at the end, and has a sliding mechanism that allows the player to change notes. The trombone uses brass and slide techniques to produce various tones and notes, making it a versatile instrument in different musical genres such as jazz, classical, and military marching bands.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThat's a saxophone.\n\nSaxophones are woodwind instruments that produce sound through vibrations of a reed in a mouthpiece.  The player manipulates the keys to change the length of the air column within the instrument, altering the pitch.  Techniques include breath control for dynamics (loudness and softness), finger dexterity for accurate note playing, and embouchure (mouth position) for tone quality.  Different saxophone styles exist (e.g., bebop, jazz, classical), each employing different techniques and musical approaches.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a saxophone.\n2. Describe the saxophone's use as a musical instrument.\n3. Mention the technique of blowing into it to produce sound.",
