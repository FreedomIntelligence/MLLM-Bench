    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe Daily Mail headlines utilize emotive language to evoke strong emotional responses from readers. Let's analyze each headline separately:\n\n**Headline 1: \"As judge brands teacher's murderer 'evil', hear the full heart-rending story on our award-winning podcast\"**\n\n* **Emotive language:** \"evil,\" \"heart-rending,\" \"award-winning.\"\n* **Impact:**  \"Evil\" directly labels the murderer, creating a strong negative emotional response and reinforcing the sense of justice. \"Heart-rending\" emphasizes the tragedy and suffering, appealing to readers' empathy and potentially driving them to listen to the podcast.  \"Award-winning\" adds credibility and implies a high-quality, compelling narrative, encouraging engagement.  The overall effect is to generate a strong emotional connection with the story and promote the podcast.\n\n**Headline 2: \"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\"**\n\n* **Emotive language:** The capitalization and forceful phrasing create a sense of urgency and threat.  The use of \"COME FOR\" is confrontational and aggressive.\n* **Impact:** This headline is designed to be provocative and polarizing. It frames the potential sacking of Suella Braverman as not just a political issue, but a direct attack on a significant segment of the Tory party and its values. This is likely to appeal to readers who already hold strong opinions about Braverman and the political climate, potentially galvanizing support for her or against Sunak. The all-caps style adds to the dramatic and confrontational tone.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\n\nThe Daily Mail uses a combination of emotional appeals (empathy, fear, anger) and persuasive techniques (authority, urgency) to grab readers' attention and influence their opinions.  The juxtaposition of a tragic crime story with a highly charged political story creates a sense of urgency and drama, maximizing engagement.  The use of emotive language is clearly strategic, designed to generate strong feelings and encourage readers to consume more of the Daily Mail's content.  The overall style is sensationalist and arguably manipulative, aiming for maximum emotional impact over neutral reporting.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotive language in headlines and specify its emotional tone (e.g., \"evil\", \"heart-rending\").\n2. Explain how the chosen language could influence readers' emotions or perceptions.",
