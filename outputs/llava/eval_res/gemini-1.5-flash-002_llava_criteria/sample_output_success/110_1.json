    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts three individuals in traditional Mongolian attire, seated before a large wooden desk or table.  The central figure appears to be the most important, based on their seating position and clothing.\n\n* **Central Figure:** This person is seated in a more prominent position, suggesting a higher status or role.  Their facial expression is one of mild contentment or perhaps a slight smile, suggesting a sense of composure and confidence. Their posture is relatively relaxed but upright, indicating respect and authority. The more ornate and richly colored clothing further reinforces this interpretation of higher status.\n\n* **Flanking Figures:** The two individuals standing on either side of the central figure appear to be attendants or individuals of lesser rank.  Their expressions are polite and somewhat formal, with neutral to slightly pleasant expressions.  They maintain a respectful distance and posture, standing straight with their hands mostly at their sides. Their clothing, while traditional, is less elaborate than the central figure's, supporting the interpretation of a lower status.  They seem attentive and possibly waiting for direction or instructions.\n\n\nOverall, the body language and facial expressions suggest a formal setting, possibly a ceremonial occasion or an official portrait. The central figure seems to be the person of authority, with the flanking figures acting as respectful attendants. The carefully arranged composition and the traditional clothing further emphasize the formality and importance of the scene.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
