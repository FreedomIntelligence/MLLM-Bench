Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the competition information in the picture, such as stage of the game, team information, etc.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's the competition information from the image:\n\n* **Game:** League of Legends\n* **Tournament:** Worlds 2023\n* **Stage:** Semifinals\n* **Match Format:** Best of 5\n* **Date & Time:** November 12th, 4:00 PM PHT\n* **Teams:** JD Gaming vs T1\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays a trophy sitting next to a TV screen, which is showing the scoreboard during a game.
