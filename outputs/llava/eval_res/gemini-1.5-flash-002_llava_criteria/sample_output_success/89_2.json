    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the decoration style in the image, what items in the picture reflect this style?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe decoration style in the image is **modern minimalist with subtle Asian influences**.\n\nHere's how the items reflect the style:\n\n* **Dark Wood Paneling:** The vertical dark wood paneling on the wall is a key element of modern design, providing texture and visual interest without being overly ornate.  The dark color adds a sophisticated touch.\n\n* **Minimalist Lighting:** The simple, geometric pendant light is characteristic of minimalist design. It's functional and visually uncluttered.\n\n* **Ginkgo Leaf Wall Decor:** The circular wall art featuring ginkgo leaves introduces a subtle Asian aesthetic. Ginkgo is a symbol often used in Asian art and design. The gold color adds a touch of elegance.\n\n* **White Perforated Headboard:** The white headboard with its perforated pattern is modern and clean. The perforations add a subtle textural element without being overly busy.  The clean lines and lack of excessive embellishment are key to the minimalist style.\n\n* **Neutral Color Palette:** The overall color scheme is neutral, with whites, browns, and dark wood tones dominating. This is a hallmark of minimalist design, creating a sense of calm and spaciousness.\n\n* **Simple Bedding:** The bedding is simple and unadorned, further emphasizing the minimalist aesthetic.\n\n\nThe combination of these elements creates a space that feels sophisticated, calm, and uncluttered, while the subtle Asian-inspired details add a touch of unique personality.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe decoration style in the image appears to be modern and contemporary. This is reflected in the use of white and brown tones, as well as the clean and sleek design. The bedroom features a white bed, a wall adorned with modern art, and brown wooden headboard, which contribute to the overall contemporary atmosphere. Additionally, the presence of a wall sconce provides a touch of modern elegance. Overall, these elements work together to create an inviting and stylish bedroom environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
