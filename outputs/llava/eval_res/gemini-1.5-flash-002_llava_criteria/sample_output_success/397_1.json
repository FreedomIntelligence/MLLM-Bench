Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe provided data does not contain information on capital expenditures.  Therefore, it's impossible to predict the capital expenditure for 2023 using linear regression or any other method based on this data alone.  The table shows cash flow statement items, not capital expenditure information.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted value should be based on \"depreciation and amortization\" figures from 2020 to 2022.\n2. Answer must include a specific numerical prediction for 2023 capital expenditure.\n3. Prediction should be derived using linear regression on the provided data points.",
