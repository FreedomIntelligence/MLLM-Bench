    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the intensity of the emotion on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and justify the assessment based on visual cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe intensity of the emotion depicted is **severe**.\n\nThis assessment is based on several visual cues:\n\n* **Facial Expression:** The character's face is contorted into a furious grimace.  The eyebrows are furrowed, the eyes are narrowed and intense, and the mouth is pulled back into a snarl, revealing clenched teeth.  These are all classic indicators of extreme anger.\n\n* **Body Language:** The clenched fists and rigid posture further emphasize the character's intense emotional state.  There's a tenseness to the entire body, suggesting a build-up of unrestrained anger.\n\n* **Color:** The vibrant, almost glowing red color of the character's skin reinforces the feeling of intense, burning rage.  The redness is not a subtle blush but a deep, saturated hue.\n\nThe combination of these visual cues strongly suggests a severe level of anger, rather than mild irritation or moderate annoyance.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe intensity of the emotion on this angry face can be assessed as severe. The visual cues indicating this level of intensity include the character's wide-opened eyes, furrowed brow, and tightly clenched teeth as they make a face of anger and frustration. The red color of the character's face also contributes to the intensity of the expression, as red is often associated with strong emotions or danger. Overall, these visual cues give the impression of a highly intense and severe emotional state.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the identified emotion matches the character's facial expression (e.g., angry, frustrated).\n2. Rate the intensity of the emotion as moderate, or severe.",
