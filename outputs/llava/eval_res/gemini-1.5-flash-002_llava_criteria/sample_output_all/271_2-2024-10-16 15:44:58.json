    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIn a setting where a group gathers to witness a signing event, what might be the underlying social connections that bring them together for this occasion?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe social connections bringing this group together for the signing event are multifaceted and stem from several sources:\n\n* **Political Affiliation and Power:**  The core connection is political.  The image shows members of Congress (Senate and House), the President, and potentially other high-ranking government officials or advisors.  Their presence signifies their involvement in the legislation being signed and their shared political goals.\n\n* **Professional Relationships:**  Many individuals present likely have long-standing professional relationships with each other, built through years of working within the same political system.  This includes colleagues, superiors, and subordinates.\n\n* **Family Ties:** The presence of children suggests that some attendees brought family members, indicating a personal connection beyond the purely professional. This could be a show of family support for the political figures involved, or simply the inclusion of family in a significant moment.\n\n* **Shared Ideology/Legislative Goals:** The individuals present likely share a common belief in the legislation being signed.  Their presence demonstrates support for the policy and its intended impact.\n\n* **Social Proximity/Networking:**  The event itself serves as a social gathering, offering an opportunity for networking and reinforcing existing relationships among powerful individuals.  Being present at such an event enhances one's political standing.\n\nIn summary, the gathering is a convergence of political power, professional ties, family connections, shared ideological beliefs, and social networking opportunities. The signing event serves as a focal point for these diverse but interconnected social dynamics.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe group gathered around the president as he signs a document may have strong connections or represent various interests that are affected by the decision being made. These connections can include social, professional, or institutional ties, such as political affiliations, business partnerships, or memberships in specific organizations. In the context of the image, the people watching the signing might be part of the administration, members of the public, or representatives of industries or organizations that will be directly impacted by the decision made by the president. The gathering could also be an opportunity for networking and building relationships, as well as learning about and discussing the decision directly with the person making it.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional roles and political affiliations of individuals.\n2. Suggest family relationships or personal connections among attendees.",
