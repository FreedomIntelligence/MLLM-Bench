    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain how the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit could be perceived as humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses and a hat, to a pineapple can be perceived as humorous because it gives the fruit a quirky and amusing appearance. This unconventional combination of a fruit and human-like accessories can be seen as a playful statement and may evoke laughter or amusement in viewers. The image of the pineapple with sunglasses lying on a bed on a blanket adds to the lighthearted and comical nature of the scene, as it is an atypical, whimsical depiction of a commonly seen object.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image of a pineapple wearing sunglasses comes from the incongruity and anthropomorphism.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Incongruity:**  Pineapples are fruits; sunglasses are human accessories.  Putting them together is unexpected and jarring, creating a comedic effect.  It's the juxtaposition of something natural and organic with something artificial and associated with human fashion.\n\n* **Anthropomorphism:**  By giving the pineapple sunglasses, we're assigning it a human characteristic.  It subtly suggests the pineapple has personality and is engaging in a human-like activity (wearing cool shades). This attribution of human qualities to a non-human object is inherently funny. The sunglasses, particularly the dark lenses, almost give the pineapple a \"cool\" or \"laid-back\" persona, which is amusing because pineapples are inanimate objects.\n\n* **Unexpectedness:** The image subverts expectations. We don't expect to see a fruit dressed up in human attire. This element of surprise contributes to the humorous effect.\n\n* **Simplicity:** The humor is straightforward and doesn't rely on complex jokes or wordplay. The visual itself is enough to elicit a chuckle.\n\n\nIn short, the humor arises from the unexpected combination of a commonplace object (a pineapple) with a human-like accessory (sunglasses), creating a visually amusing and slightly absurd scene that plays on our understanding of both objects and their usual contexts.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the accessory (sunglasses) and its typical human use.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing fruit by accessorizing.\n3. Discuss the incongruity between the pineapple and sunglasses.",
