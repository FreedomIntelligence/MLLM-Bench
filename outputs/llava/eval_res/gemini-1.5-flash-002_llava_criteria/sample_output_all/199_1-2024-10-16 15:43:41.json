Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThat's a COVID-19 antigen (Ag) rapid test.\n\nThe two lines indicate a **positive** result for COVID-19.\n\n* **The line labeled \"C\" (control):** This line always appears if the test is working correctly.  It shows the test functioned as intended.\n\n* **The line labeled \"T\" (test):** This line indicates the presence of COVID-19 antigens.  Since this line is present, along with the control line, it confirms a positive result.\n\nA negative result would only show the control line (\"C\").  A faint or unclear test line might indicate a low viral load or require a repeat test.  Always follow the instructions included with the test kit for proper interpretation.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
