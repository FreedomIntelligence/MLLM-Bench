    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe badminton racquet in the image has suffered significant damage at the joint between the shaft and the handle.  The shaft appears to be broken or severely cracked at this point.  The grip itself seems intact.\n\nRepairing this type of damage is unlikely to be successful and would likely compromise the racquet's structural integrity and playing performance.  The forces exerted during a badminton game are substantial, and a poorly repaired break could lead to further damage or even injury.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n* **Replacement is the best option:**  Given the severity of the break, replacing the racquet is strongly recommended.  Attempting a repair is likely to be a waste of time and resources.\n* **Do not attempt a DIY repair:**  Using glue or other adhesives will likely not provide sufficient strength to withstand the stresses of gameplay.\n* **Consider the cause:**  Examine how the racquet broke to avoid similar damage in the future.  Was it due to a hard impact, twisting, or a manufacturing defect?  This understanding can help you choose a more durable racquet next time.\n\n\nIn short, don't try to fix this racquet; buy a new one.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
