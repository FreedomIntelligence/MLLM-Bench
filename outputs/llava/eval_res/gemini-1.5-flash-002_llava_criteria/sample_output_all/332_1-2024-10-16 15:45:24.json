    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess vehicles' damage in the image, and rank them in order of damage severity\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several vehicles that have sustained damage during the accident. They are:\n\n1. A car in the middle of the scene, which has almost been T-boned and appears to be significantly damaged.\n2. Two cars in the foreground, which seem to have been involved in the collision. One car has a broken windshield and the other seems to be significantly damaged as well.\n3. A car near the right side of the scene, which has sustained some damage.\n4. A car at the far right side of the scene, which appears to be relatively undamaged compared to the other cars involved in the accident.\n\nIt is important to note that there might be other cars in the scene that have sustained damage, but they are not as visible or identifiable as the above vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's an assessment of the vehicle damage in the image, ranked in order of severity:\n\n1. **Red Sedan (most severely damaged):** This car is the most extensively damaged.  It appears to be severely crushed on the driver's side, indicating significant structural damage and potential for serious injuries.  It's likely totaled.\n\n2. **Silver Sedan (moderate damage):** This car has significant damage to its front end, suggesting a substantial impact. While it might be repairable, the cost of repairs could easily exceed the car's value.\n\n3. **White Sedan (minor damage):** This vehicle shows relatively minor damage, possibly limited to the front bumper and possibly some undercarriage damage. It's probably repairable at a reasonable cost.\n\nIt's important to note that this assessment is based solely on visual inspection of the image.  A proper damage assessment requires a thorough physical examination by a qualified professional.  The severity of the damage is also not directly correlated with the severity of any potential injuries to the occupants of the vehicles.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if red vehicle has severe head section damage, silver vehicle has visible rear damage.\n2. Rank vehicles' damage severity correctly as answer: red vehicle (severe damage to its head section) > silver vehicle (visible rear damage).\n3. Evaluate damage without identifying or making statements about people.",
