    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo has been edited and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the photo has been edited.  The most obvious edit is the addition of a squirrel.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Unnatural Placement:** The squirrel is positioned on the grass verge in a way that's inconsistent with the overall scene.  There's no natural cover or reason for a squirrel to be positioned so prominently and openly in that specific spot. Squirrels tend to be more cautious and less likely to be seen so clearly in the open.\n\n* **Lack of Shadow:** The squirrel lacks a realistic shadow.  Given the angle of the sun, a shadow should be visible behind it on the grass.  The lack of a shadow strongly suggests it's been digitally added without considering the lighting conditions.\n\n* **Image Quality Discrepancy:** The squirrel appears to have a slightly different level of detail and sharpness compared to the rest of the image. This subtle difference in image quality is a common clue in image manipulation.  It looks pasted in rather than naturally present.\n\n* **Unlikely Behavior:** While squirrels are common, their behavior is usually more secretive.  A squirrel sitting so still and openly in a well-lit area along a walkway is statistically improbable.\n\n\nIn summary, the unnatural positioning, lack of shadow, subtle differences in image quality, and the unlikely behavior of the squirrel all point to the squirrel being digitally added to the photograph. The rest of the image appears unedited.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the photo has been edited to appear as though there are two cute little faux foxes playing on the side of the brick walkway. In reality, there is only one fox figure located in the grass near the wall. The second fox figure is an altered photo with the face of the fox added later to create the illusion of two foxes playing. This playful and creative editing gives the scene a whimsical and charming appearance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the photo is edited by identifying the added squirrel.\n2. Evaluate the explanation of how the squirrel's integration indicates editing.\n3. Assess the consistency of lighting and shadows related to the squirrel.",
