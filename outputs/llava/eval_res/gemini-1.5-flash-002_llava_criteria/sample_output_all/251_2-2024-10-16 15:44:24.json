    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical features of the twins to identify subtle differences that may distinguish them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a comparison of the twins' physical features, noting subtle differences:\n\n* **Hair Part:** The twin on the right has her hair parted more to the side, while the twin on the left's part is less defined and appears more centrally located.\n\n* **Hair Texture/Style:** While both have long, light blonde hair, the twin on the left's hair seems slightly more textured or wavy, with some strands falling more loosely around her face. The twin on the right's hair appears slightly straighter and smoother.\n\n* **Freckles:** Both have freckles, but the distribution and density might subtly differ.  A closer inspection would be needed to confirm this, but the twin on the right might have slightly more concentrated freckles on her nose.\n\n* **Eyebrows:** The shape and thickness of their eyebrows might vary slightly.  Again, a higher resolution image would be needed for a definitive assessment.\n\n* **Facial Shape:** There may be a slight difference in the overall shape of their faces. One twin’s face might be slightly rounder or longer than the other's.  This is very subtle and difficult to determine with certainty from this image.\n\n**Important Note:** These are subtle differences, and it's entirely possible that these variations are simply due to the angle of the photo, lighting, or even slight variations in expression.  The twins are remarkably similar.  A side-by-side comparison with higher resolution would be needed to confirm these observations with greater confidence.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe twins have similar physical features; however, there are subtle differences that can be observed. First, one twin has a mole on her face close to the left side of her nose, while the other has a slight gap between her eyebrows. Second, the twin on the left has longer hair, as it extends beyond the other girl's hair. These small distinctions in their features make them stand out despite their similar appearances.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify facial feature differences such as freckle patterns, eye shape, or smile.\n2. Note hair texture, color variation, or hairstyle distinctions.\n3. Describe any other physical differences, like ear shape or skin tone.",
