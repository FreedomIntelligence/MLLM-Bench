    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the white car is traveling forward and slightly to the left. The dark-colored car is traveling in the same direction but is positioned behind and slightly to the right of the white car.  Both cars appear to be moving at a moderate speed.  Due to the snow and the blur, precise speed and trajectory predictions are impossible.\n\n**Predicted Trajectories (with caveats):**\n\n* **White Car:**  Will likely continue moving forward in its current direction unless the driver changes course.  The slight leftward movement suggests it might continue to drift slightly left.\n* **Dark Car:**  Will likely continue following behind the white car, maintaining a similar relative position unless the driver takes evasive action.\n\n\n**Collision Avoidance:**\n\nThe primary risk is the dark car potentially rear-ending the white car if it doesn't maintain a safe following distance or if the white car brakes suddenly.  The snowy conditions further exacerbate this risk due to reduced traction.\n\nTo avoid a collision:\n\n* **Driver of the dark car:** Needs to significantly increase following distance to account for reduced braking capabilities in the snow. They should also reduce speed and maintain a safe distance.  They should be prepared to steer around the white car if necessary.\n* **Driver of the white car:** Should drive smoothly and avoid sudden braking or lane changes.  They should be aware of the car behind and be prepared to signal any changes in speed or direction well in advance.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This prediction is based solely on a single moment captured in a blurry image in adverse weather conditions.  Actual trajectories can vary significantly due to driver actions, road conditions, and other unforeseen factors.  The advice given is general and should be considered alongside safe driving practices in snowy conditions.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
