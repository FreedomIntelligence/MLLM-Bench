    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a ceremonial event, likely the Changing of the Guard, outside Buckingham Palace.  Several elements of discipline and ceremony are evident:\n\n* **Uniformity:** The soldiers are impeccably dressed in identical red tunics, black bearskin hats, and black trousers.  This uniformity emphasizes the regimentation and precision of the event.\n\n* **Synchronized Movement:** The soldiers march in a precisely synchronized manner, demonstrating a high level of training and discipline. Their steps are uniform, and their movements are coordinated.\n\n* **Precision Drill:** The handling of rifles and the overall movements suggest a practiced drill routine.  The precision of their actions is a key aspect of the ceremony.\n\n* **Formal Bearing:** The soldiers maintain a formal and upright posture, reflecting military discipline and respect for the occasion.  Their expressions are serious and focused.\n\n* **Regimental Flag:** The presence of a regimental flag adds to the formality and significance of the event, further emphasizing the military tradition.\n\n* **Setting:** The backdrop of Buckingham Palace, a symbolic location of British monarchy, elevates the event to a state ceremony, highlighting its importance and tradition.\n\n* **Spectators:** The presence of a crowd of onlookers observing the event underscores its public and ceremonial nature.  Their quiet observation respects the solemnity of the occasion.\n\nIn summary, the image portrays a highly disciplined and meticulously choreographed military ceremony, emphasizing tradition, precision, and the formality of the occasion.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3. Mention the context suggesting a multicultural event.",
