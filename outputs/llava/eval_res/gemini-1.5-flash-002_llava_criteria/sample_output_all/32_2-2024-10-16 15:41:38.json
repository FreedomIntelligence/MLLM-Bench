    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of symbol is this? Identify all elements in the symbol and describe their meanings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat's a **recycling symbol** specifically indicating **High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)** plastic.\n\nLet's break down the elements:\n\n* **The Chasing Arrows Triangle:** This is the universal symbol for recycling.  The arrows in a circular motion represent the continuous process of collecting, processing, and reusing materials.\n\n* **The Number 2:** This number inside the triangle is the resin identification code (RIC) for HDPE.  Each number within the triangle corresponds to a specific type of plastic.  Number 2 specifically identifies High-Density Polyethylene.\n\n* **HDPE:** This is the abbreviation for High-Density Polyethylene.  It's a common type of plastic used in many products, including milk jugs, detergent bottles, and some food containers.  Including the abbreviation provides additional clarity for those familiar with plastic types.\n\nIn short, the symbol tells you that the item is made of HDPE plastic and is potentially recyclable (depending on local recycling programs).\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe symbol is a recycle logo, also known as the recycling arrows symbol. The symbol is usually represented by three chasing arrows forming a triangle, with the words \"HDPE\" present below the arrows. The three chasing arrows signify the process of recycling, with each arrow representing a different stage: breaking down the used material, melting it down, and remolding it into new products. The \"HDPE\" stands for high-density polyethylene, which is a type of plastic commonly used for bottles and containers. This symbol is used to indicate the recyclability of HDPE materials and encourages people to recycle items made of this type of plastic.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify symbol as resin identification code for HDPE, which is the abbreviation of High-Density Polyethylene.\n2. Explain the meaning of the triangular shape and the number 2 inside it.",
