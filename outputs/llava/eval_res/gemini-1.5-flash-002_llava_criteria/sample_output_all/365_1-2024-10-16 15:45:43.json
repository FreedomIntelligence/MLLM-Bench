Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a narrative poem on political activism's fervor and the spectrum of public opinion in cityscape demonstrations.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heart of the city, on a bustling street,\nA crowd gathered, with protesters in retreat.\nTheir fervor for change, their voices united,\nIn the name of justice, they stood all conspired.\n\nOn the corner of a downtown intersection,\nA Trump placard waved with strong affliction.\nAmidst the crowd, a man raised his hand,\nWith the sign, he stood as a bold champion.\n\nIn the image, some with Trump placards in hand,\nOthers with signs, voicing their dissent.\nA diverse group of people, opinions vast,\nIn the city landscape, their voices never past.\n\nThe intersection became a platform for the clash,\nA space for voices that couldn't be rushed.\nWith traffic lights above, the scene unfolded,\nA reflection of the nation's deeply rooted.\n\nVarious viewpoints, perspectives, and beliefs,\nThe city's vibrant colors, a canvas for griefs.\nThe people's voices, like a symphony,\nEchoing throughout the bustling reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe city breathes a concrete sigh, a grey and hurried breath,\nAs banners snap and voices rise, a chorus born of death –\nOr life renewed, depending on the lens through which you see,\nThis clash of wills, this human storm, a cityscape decree.\n\nA sign held high, a stark command, \"STOP! TRUMP!\" screams the plea,\nA face, familiar, fierce, and bold, for all the world to see.\nThe crowd divides, a shifting sea, of fervent, hopeful souls,\nAnd those who stand, with furrowed brow, and silently oppose.\n\nA man in brown, his weathered face, a quiet strength displays,\nHe holds the sign, a silent vow, through sunlit, hazy days.\nBeside him, youth, in vibrant blue, a future yet unknown,\nTheir hands entwined, a promise made, a seed of change has grown.\n\nBut further back, a different hue, a muted, cautious tone,\nThe onlookers, a silent watch, their feelings yet unshown.\nA woman old, with knowing eyes, observes the heated fray,\nHer silent judgment hangs in air, a judgment of the day.\n\nA father holds his child's small hand, a question in his gaze,\nThe weight of words, the clash of views, in this uncertain maze.\nA young man stands, aloof and cold, his arms are crossed tight,\nHe sees no cause, no burning need, to join the fervent fight.\n\nThe air is thick with passion's fire, with anger, hope, and fear,\nA tapestry of human thought, both crystal clear and drear.\nThe city watches, stone and steel, as arguments unfold,\nA microcosm of human strife, a story to be told.\n\nAnd as the day begins to fade, and shadows start to creep,\nThe crowd disperses, slowly, leaving fragments of their keep –\nA scattered leaflet, whispered word, a memory to hold,\nOf fervent hearts and differing views, a story to unfold.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes city demonstration with a \"STOP TRUMP\" sign, reflecting political activism.\n2. Narrative captures the fervor of activism and spectrum of public opinion.\n3. Poem structure and language quality align with narrative poetry conventions.",
