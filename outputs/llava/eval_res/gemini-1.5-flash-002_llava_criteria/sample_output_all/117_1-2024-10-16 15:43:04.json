    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpre the man's facial expression, what might lead to this?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe man's facial expression in the image seems to display a mix of surprise, frustration, and indignance. He is holding a rotary dial telephone over his shoulder and appears to be shouting into it. His displeasure might be caused by various factors, such as receiving unexpected or unwanted news or encountering an issue with the telephone itself, like difficulty understanding or hearing the other person, or even being faced with a situation that triggered his angry reaction. It is essential to note that the exact cause of his reaction cannot be definitively determined from the image alone, but it is clear that he is not pleased with the situation he is experiencing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe man's facial expression is one of intense anger and frustration.  His eyes are squeezed shut, his mouth is wide open in a yell, and his face is contorted.  His clenched fist on the telephone receiver further emphasizes his rage.\n\nSeveral things could lead to this reaction:\n\n* **A frustrating phone call:**  He might be arguing with someone on the other end of the line, perhaps about a business deal gone wrong, a personal conflict, or a difficult customer service interaction.  The vintage phone suggests a particularly challenging or antiquated system might be adding to his stress.\n\n* **Bad news:** He may have just received upsetting news over the phone, such as a job loss, a family emergency, or a financial setback.\n\n* **A build-up of stress:** The outburst could be the culmination of a long day or period of accumulating stress and pressure, with the phone call acting as the trigger.\n\n* **A technical problem:**  If he's having trouble with the phone itself or the connection, it could be driving him to this level of anger.\n\nIn short, the image depicts a moment of extreme emotional distress likely triggered by a negative experience related to a phone conversation.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the specific facial expression (e.g., anger, frustration) and its intensity.",
