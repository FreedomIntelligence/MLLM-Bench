    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat are the dishes in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a clay pot containing a stew or soup.  The stew appears to contain various ingredients including what looks like:\n\n* **Meat:** Possibly chicken or pork, in chunks.\n* **Vegetables/Tubers:**  Light-colored pieces that could be potatoes or other root vegetables.\n* **Mushrooms/Other Fungi:** Round, light-colored pieces that could be mushrooms or another type of fungus.\n* **Glass Noodles (or similar):**  Translucent strands visible in the soup.\n\nIn the background, there are piles of what appear to be:\n\n* **Abalone:** Several abalone shells are visible, indicating that this ingredient might also be part of the meal, possibly prepared separately.\n* **Sea Cucumber (possibly):** Dark, almost black, oblong pieces that could be sea cucumber.  This is less certain than the abalone identification.\n\nThe overall impression is that this is a luxurious and possibly medicinal Chinese soup or stew, featuring high-value ingredients like abalone and sea cucumber.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a bowl of food, a plate, and a dish with a soup in a red bowl.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the dish as Fotiaoqiang (Buddha Jumps Over the Wall).\n2. Describe visible ingredients/components of the dish.",
