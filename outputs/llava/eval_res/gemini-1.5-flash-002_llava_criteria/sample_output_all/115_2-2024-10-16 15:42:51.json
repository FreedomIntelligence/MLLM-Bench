    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the expression of the person on the left. Is he happy or miserable?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe person on the left appears to be very happy.  His eyes are crinkled, his mouth is wide open in a large smile showing his teeth, and his whole face is relaxed and expressive of genuine joy or amusement.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe expression of the person on the left is a combination of a smile and a grin, indicating that he is both happy and amused. His big smile shows that he is having a great time, while the mischievous grin suggests that he's likely enjoying a playful or entertaining moment. This unique expression might have been captured in a stylized or artistic manner, making it appear more exaggerated or colorful. However, his overall demeanor in the image suggests that he is enjoying himself and feeling lighthearted.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the person on the left as happy.\n2. Evaluate the description of facial features indicating happiness (e.g., smile, eyes).\n3. Assess the relevance and accuracy of the analysis.",
