    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf one of the person in the image wants to post this picture on social media, please help write an small article which narrates the entire scene from his/her perspective and include their sensory experiences - what they see, hear, smell, and feel - as well as their inner thoughts and emotions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a short article from the perspective of one person in the image, focusing on sensory details and inner thoughts:\n\n**Sunset Symphony: A Family Affair**\n\nThe salty air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, kissed my face as the sun dipped below the horizon.  A fiery spectacle painted the sky – oranges, reds, and purples bleeding into each other like a watercolor masterpiece.  The waves whispered secrets to the shore, their rhythmic hush a soothing counterpoint to the excited chatter of my family.  Little Leo’s giggles were particularly prominent, a joyful melody against the sunset's breathtaking crescendo.\n\nMy hand was clasped tightly in my sister's, a comforting weight in the growing twilight.  I could feel the warmth of the sand beneath my bare feet, a grounding presence as the world around us seemed to blaze with color.  The gentle breeze carried the sounds of children's laughter and the murmur of adult conversations, a harmonious blend of joy and togetherness.\n\nLooking around, I saw my family – my parents, my siblings, their partners, and my adorable nieces and nephews – all silhouetted against the vibrant sky.  It struck me how much we had all grown, how much had changed, yet how fundamentally connected we still were.  A wave of emotion washed over me – gratitude, love, and a profound sense of belonging.  This moment, this perfect sunset, felt like a symbol of our family's resilience and enduring bond.  This is what I want to remember, this feeling of unity and shared joy.\n\nThis picture, this moment, is more than just a pretty sunset; it's a testament to the love that binds us. I can't wait to share this with everyone.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs I stand on the beach with my family and friends, our hands entwined in a chain, I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and happiness. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the waves, and the sky is adorned with clouds that add to the picturesque scene. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the gentle sea breeze create a calming atmosphere. The smell of the saltwater and the cool sand beneath my feet remind me of the carefree days of childhood spent on the beach.\n\nAs I look at the people around me - our family and friends, young and old, I feel a sense of togetherness and gratitude. This moment captured, with the backdrop of a beautiful sunset, is a memory that will be cherished for years to come. It is a reminder of the importance of spending quality time with loved ones, enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\n\nWith my cellphone in hand, I snap a photo to capture this precious memory. The image not only shows the chain of people on the beach but also the vibrant colors of the sunset and the ocean waves. I share it on social media, along with a caption that expresses my emotions and thoughts about this beautiful moment. The picture spreads joy, and many people like and share it, highlighting the significance of such moments in our lives.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
