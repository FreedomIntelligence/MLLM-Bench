    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capital among the countries listed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe data shows a strong positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita for the three countries listed (US, Brazil, and Madagascar).\n\n* **US:**  Has the highest GDP per capita ($33,582) and a relatively high average night light intensity (4.66). A significant portion of its land area shows high night light intensity (69.32% at levels 0 and above).\n\n* **Brazil:** Has a significantly lower GDP per capita ($3,760) than the US, and a lower average night light intensity (0.63). The majority of its land area is also at high night light intensity (94.02% at levels 0 and above), but the distribution across intensity levels is different from the US.\n\n* **Madagascar:**  Has the lowest GDP per capita ($249) and the lowest average night light intensity (0.02).  Almost all of its land area shows very low night light intensity (99.73% at levels 0 and above).\n\n**Interpretation:**  The higher the GDP per capita, the higher the average night light intensity. This is expected because higher GDP generally correlates with more developed infrastructure, including electricity, which leads to more light at night.  However, it's important to note that this is a correlation, not causation. Other factors contribute to both GDP and electricity consumption.  The data also highlights that even within high night light intensity areas, the distribution across intensity levels can vary significantly, reflecting differences in population density and urbanization patterns.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo analyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed, one can refer to the image showing a scatter plot of these two variables. The x-axis represents the night light intensity, whereas the y-axis represents the GDP per capita. By observing the plot, one can determine the strength and direction of the relationship between these two factors. A positive correlation indicates that countries with higher night light intensity tend to have higher GDP per capita, while a negative correlation suggests the opposite. Additionally, if there is a significant linear relationship, it can provide insights into how night light intensity influences GDP per capita among these countries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Relate the night light intensity to average value per pixel.\n2. There is a positive relationship between average value per pixel (night light intensity) and GDP per capital.",
