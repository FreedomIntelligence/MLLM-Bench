    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed caption that describes not just the visual elements of the image but also suggests the geographical setting and possible climatic conditions present in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a caption describing the image:\n\nA breathtaking panorama unfolds in the high-altitude landscape, likely somewhere in the Tibetan Plateau or a similar region of the Himalayas.  A serene, meandering stream, its surface reflecting the vivid blue sky and the imposing snow-capped peaks, cuts through a valley floor of dry, golden-brown grasses.  The grasses suggest a high-altitude meadow, perhaps experiencing a late autumn or early spring season.  The stark contrast between the vibrant blue sky and the snow-covered mountains, which are partially shrouded in wispy clouds, hints at a crisp, clear day with possibly low humidity.  The snow on the mountains indicates a cold climate, likely experiencing sub-zero temperatures at night, even if the daytime sun provides some warmth. A lone figure, standing near a small structure in the lower left, provides a sense of scale to the immense grandeur of the natural surroundings. The dark, rugged slopes of the mountains, sparsely dotted with dark evergreen trees, suggest a harsh but beautiful environment, characteristic of high-altitude regions. The overall scene evokes a feeling of tranquility and awe-inspiring natural beauty.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a calm blue stream of water reflecting a majestic, snow-covered mountain peak. The scene appears to be set in a picturesque valley surrounded by tall trees and with a lush green field nearby. The presence of snow on the peak suggests colder climatic conditions at higher elevations. The tranquil atmosphere in the valley, the reflection of the mountain on the still water, and the stunning natural backdrop of the snowy peak create an idyllic and serene landscape.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption identifies mountain, river, vegetation, and any man-made structures.\n2. Caption suggests geographical setting (e.g., mountain range, region).\n3. Caption infers climatic conditions (e.g., cold, temperate, alpine).",
