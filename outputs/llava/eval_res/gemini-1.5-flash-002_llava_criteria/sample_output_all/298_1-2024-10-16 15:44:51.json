    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the size and shape of the center island and the items suspended above it, deduce if this kitchen island can be served as a dining area.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the kitchen has a large center island that appears spacious and has a sink positioned towards the right side. Moreover, various items such as pots, pans, and a bowl are hanging above the island. However, the presence of hanging items, pots, and pans over the island instead of a traditional dining table suggests that the kitchen island might not serve as a dining area. Instead, it primarily functions as a workspace for food preparation and cooking.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's an analysis of whether the kitchen island can serve as a dining area:\n\nThe island is relatively large, providing ample surface area.  However, the hanging pot rack directly above it significantly reduces the usable headroom.  This would make sitting at the island uncomfortable for anyone of average or taller height.  Therefore, while it *could* technically be used for informal dining (perhaps for a quick breakfast or snack), it's not ideally suited for comfortable, regular dining.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the island's size and shape accommodate dining functions.\n2. Evaluate the practicality of suspended items for a dining area.\n3. Determine if the island's height is suitable for seated dining.",
