    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils or clothing to protect themselves from a severe dust storm, also known as a sandstorm.  The intense wind carries large amounts of sand and dust particles, which can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, and reduced visibility.  The veils act as a barrier against this airborne debris.\n\nThe weather occurrence, the dust storm, is caused by several factors, all related to atmospheric conditions and the environment:\n\n* **Strong winds:**  High-speed winds are the primary driver of dust storms.  These winds lift loose sand and soil particles from the ground.  The strength and duration of the winds determine the intensity and extent of the storm.\n\n* **Dry conditions:** Dust storms are more common in arid and semi-arid regions with little vegetation to hold the soil in place.  The lack of moisture allows the wind to easily pick up the dry soil.  Prolonged drought exacerbates this.\n\n* **Loose soil:**  Areas with loose, unconsolidated soil are particularly vulnerable.  This includes areas with little or no vegetation cover, recently disturbed land (like agricultural fields or construction sites), and dry lakebeds.\n\n* **Temperature gradients:**  Significant temperature differences between the ground and the air can create instability in the atmosphere, leading to strong convective currents that lift dust particles.\n\n* **Atmospheric pressure systems:**  Changes in atmospheric pressure, such as the passage of a cold front or a low-pressure system, can create strong wind shear and contribute to dust storm formation.\n\nIn summary, the combination of strong winds, dry conditions, loose soil, and atmospheric instability creates the perfect conditions for a dust storm, forcing the people in the image to take protective measures to avoid harm.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
