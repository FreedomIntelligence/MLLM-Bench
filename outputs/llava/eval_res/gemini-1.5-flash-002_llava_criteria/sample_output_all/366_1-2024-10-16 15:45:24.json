    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe fog hung heavy, a thick, white curtain drawn across the landscape.  Elias stood at the edge of the road, the damp chill seeping into his bones.  It wasn't the cold that bothered him, though; it was the uncertainty.  Before him stretched an endless ribbon of asphalt, swallowed by the mist, a path leading into the unknown.  This wasn't just any road; it was the road to his next chapter, a chapter unwritten, a story yet to unfold.\n\nHe’d spent years on well-trodden paths, following the familiar lines etched by expectation.  He'd been a good son, a diligent student, a reliable employee. He’d played the role expected of him, but the applause felt hollow, the accolades meaningless.  Something within him yearned for more, for the untamed wilderness of possibility.  And so, he’d arrived at this precipice, this foggy road, a symbol of his newfound freedom.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he launched himself into the air, a fleeting moment of weightlessness.  He soared above the road, a black silhouette against the white canvas of the fog, a tiny figure defying gravity, embracing the leap of faith.  He landed softly, the impact absorbed by the asphalt, and began to walk.\n\nThe road wasn't easy.  The fog played tricks on his eyes, distorting distances, blurring the edges of reality.  There were moments of doubt, of fear, where the allure of the familiar tugged at him.  He could turn back, retrace his steps, return to the safety of the known.  But the memory of his jump, the feeling of liberation, propelled him forward.\n\nHe walked for hours, the yellow line in the center of the road his only constant companion, a beacon in the swirling white.  Sometimes, the fog thinned, revealing glimpses of the landscape – a dark, imposing mountain range, a hidden valley shrouded in mystery.  These glimpses, fleeting as they were, only fueled his curiosity, his desire to explore.\n\nHe met no one on his journey, only the whispers of the wind and the soft crunch of his shoes on the road.  It was a solitary journey, a pilgrimage into the depths of himself.  He learned to rely on his instincts, to trust his intuition, to embrace the unexpected.  The road, once a symbol of fear, became a teacher, shaping him, molding him into someone stronger, more resilient, more authentic.\n\nAs the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, the fog began to lift.  The road ahead, though still stretching into the distance, was no longer obscured.  He could see further now, the path less daunting, less mysterious.  He smiled, a genuine smile born of self-discovery and acceptance.  The journey was far from over, but he knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within his soul, that he was finally on the right road.  The road to his own freedom.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3. Incorporates the visual of the person jumping as part of the narrative.",
