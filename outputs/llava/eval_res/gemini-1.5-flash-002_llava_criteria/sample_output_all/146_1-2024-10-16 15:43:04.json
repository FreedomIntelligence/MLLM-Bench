    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in this meme relies on the exaggeration of the cat's facial expressions to represent the transformative effect of coffee.  The exaggeration is a form of hyperbole.\n\n**Before Coffee:** The cat's expression is one of extreme grumpiness. Its eyes are narrowed, its mouth is downturned in a severe frown, and its overall demeanor projects annoyance and displeasure. This is a significant exaggeration of a mildly grumpy cat;  most cats don't display this level of intense displeasure on a regular basis.\n\n**After Coffee:** The cat's transformation is equally hyperbolic. Its eyes are wide open, almost comically so, conveying a sense of intense excitement or even mania. Its mouth is open in a wide, almost unnatural grin, revealing its teeth.  The expression goes far beyond simple happiness; it's a cartoonish level of joy and energy.  A real cat rarely displays such an extreme and exaggerated reaction to coffee.\n\n**Contribution to Humor:** The humor stems from the relatable experience of feeling sluggish and irritable before caffeine, and then energized and happy afterward.  The meme's use of hyperbole amplifies this contrast, making it funnier. The extreme expressions are funny because they are unrealistic, yet they effectively capture the feeling of a drastic mood shift.  The absurdity of the cat's exaggerated reactions creates a comedic effect, making the meme memorable and shareable.  It's funny because it's an over-the-top representation of a common human experience.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
