    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's an assessment of the floor plan's design regarding bedroom privacy and accessibility to communal areas:\n\n**Privacy:**\n\n* **Bedrooms:** The bedrooms offer a moderate level of privacy.  They are clustered together in one wing of the house, separated from the main living areas by a hallway and the master bedroom is further separated from the other bedrooms by a small hallway.  However, the proximity of the bedrooms to each other might reduce privacy, especially if sound travels easily between rooms.  The lack of direct access between the bedrooms also contributes to a better sense of privacy.\n\n* **Bathrooms:** Each bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom, significantly enhancing privacy.\n\n\n**Accessibility to Communal Areas:**\n\n* **Living Room:** The living room is centrally located, providing easy access from all bedrooms and the kitchen/dining area.  This is a good design feature for family interaction.\n\n* **Kitchen/Dining:** The kitchen and dining area are conveniently located near the living room, facilitating easy movement between these spaces.\n\n* **Prayer Room:** The prayer room is somewhat isolated, which might be desirable for some but less convenient for quick access from other areas.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe floor plan prioritizes a balance between privacy and accessibility. While the bedrooms offer reasonable privacy, the overall design promotes a flow between the communal areas.  The placement of the prayer room is a design choice that might need to be considered based on the family's preferences.  The central location of the living room makes it easy to access from all parts of the house.  The en-suite bathrooms in each bedroom are a significant positive for privacy.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
