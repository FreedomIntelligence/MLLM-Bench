    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat looks like a superficial partial-thickness burn.  It's characterized by redness, blistering, and some damage to the top layers of skin.  It doesn't appear to be deep enough to involve the deeper layers of skin (dermis).\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* **Keep it clean:** Gently wash the area with mild soap and cool water once or twice a day.  Avoid scrubbing. Pat it dry.\n* **Don't break the blisters:**  Leave intact blisters alone.  Breaking them increases the risk of infection.\n* **Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment:** This helps prevent infection.  A product like bacitracin or neosporin is suitable.\n* **Keep it covered:**  A loose, clean bandage will protect the wound from further irritation and infection.  Change the bandage daily or as needed.\n* **Elevate the hand:**  If possible, keep your hand elevated to reduce swelling.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relief:**  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain and inflammation.\n* **Monitor for signs of infection:** Watch for increased pain, swelling, redness spreading beyond the initial burn area, pus, or fever.  If any of these occur, seek medical attention immediately.\n* **Avoid harsh chemicals and irritants:**  Keep the area away from soaps, lotions, and other substances that could irritate the wound.\n* **Consider a cool compress:**  For pain relief, apply a cool (not cold) compress for 10-15 minutes at a time, several times a day.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\n\n* If the burn is larger than 3 inches in diameter.\n* If the burn is deep (goes beyond the top layer of skin).\n* If you have signs of infection (as mentioned above).\n* If the pain is severe and not controlled by over-the-counter pain relievers.\n* If you have any concerns or questions about the healing process.\n\n\nThis advice is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice.  If you have any concerns, it's always best to consult a doctor or other healthcare professional.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
