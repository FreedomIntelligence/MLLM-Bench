    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the sign in the image. What does this sign mean?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat's a prohibition sign.  The image shows a hand giving a \"thumbs up\" gesture crossed out with a red circle and diagonal line.\n\nThis sign means **\"No Touching\"** or **\"Do Not Touch\"**.  It indicates that physical contact with something (a surface, object, or perhaps even a person) is prohibited.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe sign in the image is a \"no thumbs up\" or \"no thumbs up to you\" sign, indicating that someone is not giving their approval or support. The thumbs up symbol is being crossed out, suggesting that it is not allowed or is actively discouraged in this particular context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the sign as indicating \"no hitchhiking.\"\n2. Explanation aligns with common understanding of hitchhiking prohibition.\n3. Answer must not include additional unrelated details or symbols.",
