Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the equation, we can follow the steps of cross multiplication and use the distributive property.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two fractions with common numerators and denominators:\n\n(1/2) x (8/4) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can take the simplified equation to its next level by factoring the numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/2) = 2/4 = (1/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 - 1/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nThis means the equation is already simplified and there are no further steps to take. The final answer is 0.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's how to simplify the equation cleverly:\n\n**1. Combine the fractions in the numerator and denominator separately:**\n\n* **Numerator:**  To combine x/(x+1) + 1, find a common denominator (x+1):\n\n   [x/(x+1)] + [(x+1)/(x+1)] = (x + x + 1) / (x + 1) = (2x + 1) / (x + 1)\n\n* **Denominator:** To combine 1 - x/(x-1), find a common denominator (x-1):\n\n   [(x-1)/(x-1)] - [x/(x-1)] = (x - 1 - x) / (x - 1) = -1 / (x - 1)\n\n\n**2. Rewrite the complex fraction as a division problem:**\n\nThe original complex fraction is now:\n\n[(2x + 1) / (x + 1)] / [-1 / (x - 1)]\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n[(2x + 1) / (x + 1)] * [(x - 1) / -1]\n\n\n**3. Simplify:**\n\nMultiply the numerators and the denominators:\n\n-(2x + 1)(x - 1) / (x + 1)\n\nExpand the numerator (optional, but often helpful):\n\n- (2x² - 2x + x - 1) / (x + 1) = -(2x² - x - 1) / (x + 1)  or ( -2x² + x + 1) / (x + 1)\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the equation is **-(2x² - x - 1) / (x + 1)** or **(-2x² + x + 1) / (x + 1)**.  Both are equivalent.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3. Final answer should be mathematically equivalent to the original equation.",
