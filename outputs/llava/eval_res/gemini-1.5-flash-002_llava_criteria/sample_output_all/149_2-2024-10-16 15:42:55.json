    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze how the visual metaphor in the right image exaggerates the challenge of the situation depicted in the left image and why this hyperbole is humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's an analysis of the meme's humor:\n\nThe meme uses a visual metaphor to highlight the perceived stress of having a baby.  The left panel shows a seemingly calm scene: a parent gently placing a baby in a crib. This represents the outward appearance of the situation.\n\nThe right panel drastically exaggerates the feeling of the situation by replacing the baby with a lit stick of dynamite.  This is the hyperbole. The visual of a ticking time bomb implies the immense pressure and anxiety parents feel, particularly during the early stages of parenthood. The constant demands and potential for disruption of sleep, feeding schedules, and other aspects of life are represented by the ticking clock on the bomb.\n\nThe humor comes from the stark contrast between the seemingly innocuous reality (a sleeping baby) and the wildly exaggerated internal experience (a ticking time bomb). This incongruity creates a comedic effect.  It's funny because it's relatable: parents often feel overwhelmed despite the outward calm, and the meme uses absurd exaggeration to express that feeling.  The humor relies on the audience understanding the unspoken anxieties associated with caring for a newborn.  The hyperbole makes the relatable feeling of stress both funny and validating for parents who experience it.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the right image, a toy gun is placed on the baby lying on the bed, while the left image shows the baby sleeping peacefully without any danger. The visual metaphor in the right image exaggerates the challenge of the situation by presenting an exaggerately harmful item, the toy gun, which suggests a level of danger that is far from the actual situation depicted in the left image. This hyperbole is humorous as it creates a contrast between the calm and peaceful scenario in the left image and the imaginary, exaggerated dangers in the right image. This contrast emphasizes the fact that the baby's situation in the left image is benign and not a cause for concern, while the right image uses over-the-top elements to create humor by juxtaposing two vastly different scenarios in a single image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the contrast between the normal task (left) and its exaggerated version (right) as a metaphor for difficulty.\n2. Explain why the exaggeration (dynamite as a diaper) creates humor in the context of the challenge.\n3. Assess the effectiveness of the visual metaphor in conveying the hyperbolic sense of challenge.",
