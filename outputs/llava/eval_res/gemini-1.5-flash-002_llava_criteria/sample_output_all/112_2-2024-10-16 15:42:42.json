    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues, what is the facial expression of the woman?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the visual cues, the woman appears to have a serious or pensive expression.  Her mouth is slightly pursed, and her eyes are not smiling; they seem somewhat distant or thoughtful.  The overall effect is one of quiet contemplation rather than happiness, sadness, or anger.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the woman appears to be looking straight ahead and appears to be staring into the distance. She is not smiling or showing any expression indicating she is happy or sad. This neutral facial expression might suggest that she is calm, focused, or in deep thought.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the woman's facial expression accurately.\n2. Consider the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth as key indicators of expression.\n3. Do not let face paint distract from recognizing the underlying expression.\n",
