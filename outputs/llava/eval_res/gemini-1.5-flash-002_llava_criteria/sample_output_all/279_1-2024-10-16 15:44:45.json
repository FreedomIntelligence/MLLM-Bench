    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyzing the pairwise relationships between all characters in the diagram.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, three people are standing together, possibly celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. The woman and two kids are holding up cow-shaped and possibly horse-shaped hats, which could be part of a party theme or decoration. The pairwise relationships between the characters are as follows:\n\n1. The woman is standing in the middle.\n2. The two kids are on either side of her, with one on her left and the other on her right.\n\nThese three people create a cohesive group, likely enjoying a fun and memorable event together.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's an analysis of the pairwise relationships between the characters in the image:\n\n* **Woman and Boy:** The woman has her arm around the boy, suggesting a close, caring relationship. This could be a mother-son, aunt-nephew, or other familial or close-friend relationship.\n\n* **Woman and Girl:** The woman and girl are standing close together, but there's less direct physical contact than with the boy.  The closeness suggests a similar caring relationship as with the boy, possibly mother-daughter, aunt-niece, or close friend.\n\n* **Boy and Girl:** The boy and girl are standing side-by-side, but there's no direct interaction between them.  Their proximity suggests they might be siblings, cousins, or friends.  The lack of direct interaction doesn't provide strong evidence for the nature of their relationship.\n\n\n**In summary:** The image strongly suggests a familial or close-friend relationship between the adult woman and the two children. The relationship between the two children is less clear, but they likely know each other well.  The overall scene depicts a playful and affectionate group.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the relationship in a pairwise fashion.\n2. Use social cues like body language, attire, and props for reasoning.\n3. Avoid definitive statements of the relationships.",
