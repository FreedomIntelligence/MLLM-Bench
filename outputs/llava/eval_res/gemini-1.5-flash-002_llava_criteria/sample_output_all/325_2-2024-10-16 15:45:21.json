    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality can be improved in several ways using photo editing software:\n\n* **Brightness and Contrast:** The image is very dark. Increasing the overall brightness and adjusting the contrast will reveal more detail in the shadows and highlights.  A curves adjustment could be particularly helpful to lift the shadows without overexposing the lights.\n\n* **Noise Reduction:**  There's likely some digital noise, especially in the darker areas. Applying noise reduction will smooth out the image and make it appear cleaner.\n\n* **Sharpness:** The image might benefit from a slight sharpening to improve the definition of edges and details.  Be careful not to oversharpen, which can introduce artifacts.\n\n* **Color Correction:** The color balance seems slightly off; it's leaning towards a cool tone.  A slight warming of the image might make it look more natural.  The blue light on the house in the background could also be toned down slightly to better integrate with the rest of the image.\n\n* **Exposure:**  The exposure is uneven; some parts are too dark, while the lights are blown out.  Adjusting the exposure might help balance this.\n\nSpecific software recommendations:\n\n* **Adobe Photoshop:** Offers the most comprehensive tools for image editing.\n* **GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program):** A free and open-source alternative to Photoshop with many similar features.\n* **Luminar AI/Neo:**  These AI-powered editors offer automated enhancements that can significantly improve image quality with minimal effort.\n\n\nBy carefully adjusting these parameters, the image can be made significantly clearer, brighter, and more visually appealing.  The goal is to enhance the details of the house, the lights, and the cars without making it look unnatural or overly processed.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
