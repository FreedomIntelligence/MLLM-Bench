    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe skater boy is likely to land on the nearby ramp in front of him.  This is a prediction based on his trajectory and body position.\n\nThe risk assessment is moderate to high.  The factors contributing to the risk include:\n\n* **Height:** He's at a considerable height, meaning a fall could result in injury.\n* **Landing:** The precision required to land cleanly on the ramp is high. A slight miscalculation could lead to a fall.\n* **Speed:** While not explicitly shown, his speed is likely significant given the jump.  Higher speed increases the impact force of a potential fall.\n* **Surface:** Concrete is a hard surface, offering little to no give in a fall.\n\nWhile skilled skaters perform similar maneuvers regularly, the inherent risks associated with this type of jump should not be underestimated.  A successful landing depends heavily on the skater's skill, balance, and precise execution.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
