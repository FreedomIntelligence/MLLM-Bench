    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of wear of the headset, and infer the possible cause of the wear.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headset shows significant wear on the headband.  The leatherette or faux leather covering is peeling and fraying, exposing the underlying foam padding.  The wear is concentrated along the top of the headband, suggesting this area experiences the most pressure and friction.\n\nThe most likely cause of this wear is repeated bending and flexing of the headband during use.  The material is likely not of high quality, making it susceptible to cracking and peeling with prolonged use and stress.  The friction from the wearer's head also contributes to the degradation of the material.  It's also possible that exposure to sweat or other moisture may have accelerated the deterioration.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is holding a black headset with a fuzzy texture on the headband and ear pads. The headset appears to be worn down to the fabric, which indicates significant wear and tear. The possible cause of this wear could be regular use over a prolonged period, as headsets are often used daily by people engaged in activities such as gaming, listening to music, or participating in online meetings. The wear could also be a result of a lack of proper care, such as not regularly cleaning the headset or storing it in a dusty or poorly organized space. Overall, the headset's condition suggests that it has been used extensively and not well-maintained.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify wear on headset: peeling material, discoloration, deformation.\n2. Infer wear causes: usage, material quality, environmental factors.",
