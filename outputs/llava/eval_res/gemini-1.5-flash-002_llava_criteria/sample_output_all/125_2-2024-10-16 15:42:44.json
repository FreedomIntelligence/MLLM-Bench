    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the childâ€™s behavior to infer the narrative and sentiment being portrayed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image portrays a young girl hiding under her covers, her eyes wide with fear.  Her hands are clutching the blanket, suggesting a strong feeling of anxiety or terror.  The low light and dark shadows add to the overall sense of unease.\n\nThe narrative could be interpreted in several ways:\n\n* **A nightmare:** The girl may have woken from a frightening dream and is seeking refuge under the covers.\n* **Fear of the dark:**  A common childhood fear, the darkness of the room could be the source of her anxiety.\n* **Something else in the room:**  The girl may have heard or seen something that has frightened her.\n* **A traumatic event:**  The image could also suggest a more serious underlying issue, such as a traumatic experience.\n\nThe overall sentiment is one of fear, vulnerability, and insecurity.  The child's expression and body language clearly communicate a need for safety and comfort.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a little girl is pulling the sheet down over her face while lying in bed. Her action of partially hiding herself could be interpreted as a playful act or a sign of shyness or fear. It is difficult to determine the exact context or narrative behind her behavior, but it could be a moment captured in a childhood scenario or a scene from a movie or story. The sentiment being portrayed appears to be a light-hearted one, with the little girl expressing either playfulness, curiosity, or a sense of unease in her current situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the child's emotion from facial expression and body language.\n2. Describe the narrative context implied by the child's behavior.",
