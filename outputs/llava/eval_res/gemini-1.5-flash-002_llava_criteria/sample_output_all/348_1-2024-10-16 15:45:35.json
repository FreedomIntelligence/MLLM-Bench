    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze if the people in the image hold a ethical demand.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the people in the image are holding up signs with political demands, which suggests that they are advocating for a particular cause or ethical position. Given the variety of signs they are holding, it indicates that they are representing diverse opinions or concerns, which is typically found in protests or demonstrations. By participating in such events, the individuals are voicing their opinions and raising awareness about the issues they consider important, with the intention of influencing societal change, policy-making, or public opinion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the people in the image hold an ethical demand.  The signs they are carrying (\"End Racism,\" \"Racism is a crime against humanity\") advocate for the elimination of racism, a form of discrimination that violates fundamental human rights.  The ethical demand is for a society free from racial prejudice and injustice, which is widely considered a moral imperative.  Their protest is a call for social justice and equality, aligning with widely accepted ethical principles.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the image depicts a demand for ethical treatment or social justice.\n2. Evaluate the presence of signs or expressions that convey an ethical stance.\n3. Determine the context of the demand, such as anti-racism or human rights.",
