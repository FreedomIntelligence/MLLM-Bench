    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a caption that not only describes the group of people and their attire but also infers the cultural significance or occasion that might have brought them together.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are a few caption options for the image:\n\n**Option 1 (Focus on celebration):**\n\n\"A vibrant celebration of Mongolian culture!

This group, dressed in beautiful traditional deels, celebrates their heritage and culture.\"\n\n\n**Option 4 (Questioning, engaging caption):**\n\n\"What brings this stunning group together?  Their vibrant traditional Mongolian clothing hints at a special celebration or cultural event.  What do you think is the occasion?\"\n\n\nChoose the caption that best fits the intended tone and platform for sharing the image.  The word \"deel\" is used as it's the name of the traditional Mongolian robe.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe group of people in the image is all dressed in traditional Chinese clothing, showing their cultural heritage and pride. They are posing for a photo in front of a building, and some of them are giving a thumbs-up sign, signifying their happiness and excitement for the occasion.
