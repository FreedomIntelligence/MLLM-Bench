    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side closely to identify and compare the differences between them as much as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a comparison of the left and right images:\n\nThe differences are subtle, focusing on small details in the dogs' appearances and postures:\n\n* **Dog on the Left (Both Images):**  The dog on the left has a slightly different tail position and shape. The tail is more curved and appears a bit longer.\n\n* **Dog on the Right (Both Images):** The dog on the right has a slightly different posture.  The right hand (from the viewer's perspective) is positioned slightly lower.  There is also a minor difference in the fur around its head; the right image has slightly more detail or \"fuzziness\" to the fur.\n\n\nThe overall scene, the books, backpacks, and grass remain identical.  The changes are minor and likely intended as a subtle \"spot the difference\" exercise.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are two different representations of a puppy on a leash carrying a backpack. The two images can be distinguished by analyzing the expressions of the cute puppy. While the puppy is walking, it has a distinctive smile on its face, indicating that it is happy and enjoying the moment. In various locations throughout the images, you can also see the grass on the ground, adding to the visual context of the scene. The two different expressions of the puppy and the overall atmosphere in both pictures can be compared, highlighting the variations in their expressions and the overall scene they depict.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences: eye color, belt, shirt stripes, facial hair, eyebrow, socks, left dog's bag, left dog's eyelash, left dog's mouth wrinkle.\n2. Ensure all differences listed in the reference are mentioned accurately.\n3. Compare both images for any additional differences not listed in the reference.",
