    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThat's a promotional image, likely a still from a video.  The quality assessment depends on what's expected.\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Purposeful Style:** The image is clearly stylized and not aiming for photorealistic quality.  The slightly blurred background and focus on the phone are intentional choices.\n* **Clear Subject:** The subject (the phone and hand) is in sharp focus and easily identifiable.\n* **Legible Text:** The text overlay is clear and easy to read.\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Resolution:** The resolution isn't high.  If enlarged significantly, it would become pixelated.  This is typical for promotional images used online, though.\n* **Background Blur:** While stylistic, the background blur isn't particularly smooth or natural-looking. It appears slightly artificial.\n* **Hand/Glove:** The hand (wearing a glove) looks a little unnatural or posed.  This detracts slightly from the overall aesthetic.\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe image quality is adequate for its intended purpose—likely online advertising or social media. It's not high-resolution or photorealistic, but it's clear, communicates its message effectively, and has a consistent aesthetic.  It's not a high-quality image in a technical sense, but it's perfectly acceptable for its context.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3. Assess the visibility and legibility of the text \"Love Playing Snake?\".",
