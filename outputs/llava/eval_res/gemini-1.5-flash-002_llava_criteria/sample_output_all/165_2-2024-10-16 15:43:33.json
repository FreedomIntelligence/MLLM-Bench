    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the details of the event promoted, and assess the effectiveness of the poster as a marketing tool for the movie.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a breakdown of the event and an assessment of the poster's effectiveness:\n\n**Event Details:**\n\n* **Movie:** *Godzilla Minus One*\n* **Event Type:** Early access fan event for the movie.\n* **Date:** November 29, 2023\n* **Movie Release Date:** December 1, 2023\n* **Format:**  The poster emphasizes experiencing the movie in 4DX.  This implies a special screening with enhanced sensory effects (motion, water, wind, etc.).\n\n**Assessment of Poster Effectiveness:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Visually Striking:** The poster uses a bold, stylized image of Godzilla, with a striking color palette of teal and black against white.  It's eye-catching and memorable. The artistic style is unique and impactful.\n* **Clear Messaging:** The key information (movie title, dates, and 4DX emphasis) is easily readable.\n* **Sense of Urgency:** The \"Early Access\" messaging creates a sense of exclusivity and encourages immediate action.\n* **Target Audience Alignment:** The design appeals to fans of Godzilla and action movies who appreciate a visually intense and exciting experience.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Limited Information:** The poster lacks details about ticket purchasing, location, or any other logistical information. This makes it less effective as a standalone marketing tool.  It needs to direct people to a website or other source for details.\n* **Abstract Design:** While visually appealing, the abstract nature of the Godzilla image might not immediately communicate the movie's content to those unfamiliar with the franchise.\n* **Overly Stylized:** The artistic style, while unique, may alienate some viewers who prefer a more traditional movie poster approach.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe poster is effective in generating interest and creating a strong visual identity for the *Godzilla Minus One* early access event.  However, its lack of practical information significantly limits its potential.  It serves best as a teaser or attention-grabbing element within a larger marketing campaign that provides the necessary details for attendance.  The poster is excellent at creating excitement and brand awareness, but it needs to be paired with other materials to be fully functional.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe poster promotes the movie \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\" and features the main character, a massive blue creature, with the words \"Feel it in ARX.\" The movie is scheduled for release in 2019.\n\nAs a marketing tool, the poster is quite effective in generating excitement for the upcoming movie. By using a large, eye-catching image of the main character and a bold, capitalized message, the poster draws attention to the movie and creates a sense of anticipation for the viewers. The blend of a memorable character and the catchphrase \"Feel it in ARX\" can evoke curiosity and encourage conversation among fans and potential audiences, ultimately increasing the movie's visibility and interest.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify movie title (Godzilla Minus One), release date (December 1, 2023 (12.01.23)), and event date (November 29, 2023 (11.29.23)) from the poster.\n2. Evaluate visual elements' effectiveness in conveying the movie's theme.",
