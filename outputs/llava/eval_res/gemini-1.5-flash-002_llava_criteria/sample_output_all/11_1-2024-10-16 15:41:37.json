    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the text in the image and the implicit message conveyed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe text in the image is a saying or a motivational quote, which reads \"Life is a Straight Road to Success.\" The message conveyed by this quote is that success is a direct and clear pathway, and that with determination and effort, one can achieve success in life. The red background and bold lettering emphasize the importance and positivity of the message.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's a breakdown of the image and its implicit message:\n\n**Text Recognition:**\n\nThe central text on the red background reads:\n\n\"LIFE IS A STRAIGHT ROAD TO SUCCESS\"\n\n**Implicit Message:**\n\nThe explicit message is a common, almost cliché, statement about the path to success.  However, the *implicit* message is far more nuanced and critical:\n\n* **The irony of the \"straight road\":** The text is painted on a background featuring chaotic, childlike drawings of faces and what appear to be plants or abstract forms.  This juxtaposition directly contradicts the idea of a \"straight road.\"  Life, the artwork suggests, is not a simple, linear path. It's messy, unpredictable, and full of complexities.\n\n* **Subversion of a common trope:** The artwork takes a well-worn motivational phrase and uses the visual context to undermine its simplistic message.  It questions the very notion of a straightforward route to success.\n\n* **The nature of success itself:**  The simplistic smiley faces, while suggesting happiness, also hint at a potentially superficial or even manufactured notion of success. Are these truly happy faces, or are they masks? The artwork leaves this open to interpretation.\n\nIn short, the implicit message is a commentary on the often-oversimplified and unrealistic portrayal of the path to success.  It suggests that the journey is far more complex and less predictable than commonly believed.  The visual chaos surrounding the straightforward text highlights the inherent contradiction.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately transcribe all text: \"Life is a straight road to success.\"\n2. Describe the image's implicit message or metaphor.",
