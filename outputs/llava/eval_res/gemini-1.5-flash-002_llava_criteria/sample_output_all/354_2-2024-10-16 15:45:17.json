    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is likely AI-generated.  Here's why:\n\n* **Unrealistic Wave Scale and Physics:** The size and behavior of the tsunami wave are highly improbable.  Tsunamis, while devastating, don't typically maintain such a uniformly tall, unbroken wall of water over such a long distance. The wave's interaction with buildings and vehicles also defies realistic physics.  Real tsunamis would have far more chaotic and destructive effects.\n\n* **Lack of Realistic Debris and Destruction:** While some debris is depicted, the level of destruction is surprisingly minimal considering the scale of the wave.  A wave of that magnitude would cause significantly more damage and scattering of objects.\n\n* **Overall Composition:** The image has a slightly unnatural, almost \"painted-on\" quality to the wave, especially where it interacts with the buildings.  The contrast and sharpness between the wave and the city seem artificially enhanced.\n\nWhile it's possible to create a realistic-looking tsunami simulation, this image exhibits several telltale signs of AI image generation techniques, particularly in the unrealistic physics of the wave and the somewhat artificial blending of the wave with the city background.  The lack of fine details in the wave's texture and the overall cleanness of the image also contribute to this assessment.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
