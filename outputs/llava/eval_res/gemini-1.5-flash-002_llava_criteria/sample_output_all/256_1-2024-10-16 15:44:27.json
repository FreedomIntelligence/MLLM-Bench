    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the location of cactus which is different from the others.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere is a single cactus positioned slightly outside the main pattern. This cactus is located in the top row, second from the left. It stands out because it is not positioned in the same way as the other cacti, who are arranged in a pattern or mosaic-like pattern. The outlier's position might be intentional to add a touch of variety to the overall design.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe odd one out is located in the bottom row, second from the right.  That cactus has only two flowers on top, while all the others have three.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer specifies cactus location as row 2, column 6.",
