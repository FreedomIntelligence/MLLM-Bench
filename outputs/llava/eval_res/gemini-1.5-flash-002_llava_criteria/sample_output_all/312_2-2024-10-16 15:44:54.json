    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCalculate the value of I in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's how to solve the integral:\n\n**1. Rewrite the integral:**\n\nThe integral is:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (ln(x) / 4sin²(ln(x))) dx\n\n**2. Substitution:**\n\nLet u = ln(x).  Then du = (1/x) dx.  Also, when x = 0, u = -∞, and when x = 1, u = 0.  We also have x = e<sup>u</sup>, so dx = e<sup>u</sup> du.  Substituting these into the integral gives:\n\nI = ∫₋∞⁰ (u / 4sin²(u)) e<sup>u</sup> du\n\n**3.  This integral is difficult to solve analytically.**  There's no elementary function that represents its antiderivative.  Standard integration techniques (like integration by parts or trigonometric substitution) won't yield a closed-form solution.  Numerical methods would be required to approximate the value of I.\n\n**4. Numerical Approximation (using Wolfram Alpha or similar software):**\n\nUsing numerical integration techniques (like Simpson's rule or more advanced methods), software such as Wolfram Alpha can provide an approximate value for the definite integral.  The result will be a numerical approximation, not an exact symbolic answer.  I cannot perform this calculation here.  You would need to input the integral into a computational tool to get the numerical value.\n\n\nIn summary, while a precise analytical solution is not readily available, a numerical approximation can be obtained using computational software.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the equation provided in the image, I is equal to 4. Sin(2I).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer correctly calculates I as -25/56 from the integral in the image.\n2. Solution demonstrates understanding of integral calculus and trigonometric identities.\n3. Response includes a step-by-step explanation of the integral calculation process.",
