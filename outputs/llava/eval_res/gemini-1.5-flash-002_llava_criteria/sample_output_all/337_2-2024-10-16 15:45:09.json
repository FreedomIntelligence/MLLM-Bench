    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nObserve debris-clearing methods and safety gear to gauge rescue safety and efficiency.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows the aftermath of a fire, with extensive debris scattered across the scene.  There is no visible debris-clearing activity taking place, nor is there any safety gear evident.  A lone child stands amidst the ruins, indicating a lack of immediate rescue or safety measures.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this image:\n\n* **Rescue Safety:** Appears very low.  The presence of the child unsupervised in a hazardous environment highlights a lack of safety precautions and potential dangers from sharp debris, unstable structures, and residual hazards from the fire.\n\n* **Efficiency of Debris Clearing:**  Zero.  No clearing efforts are visible.\n\n\nTo accurately assess rescue safety and efficiency, more information is needed.  The image only captures a snapshot of a post-disaster scene and doesn't show the actions (or lack thereof) of emergency services.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image presents a scene of a child standing amidst a pile of rubble in a city, possibly after a natural disaster or a collapsing structure. In the process of clearing debris, several people can be seen, including one person standing in the middle and others surrounding the pile. However, we cannot easily identify any specific safety gear or debris-clearing methods being used.\n\nThe presence of the child and people around the pile indicates a sense of urgency and concern for the safety of those involved in the rescue efforts. To better understand the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation, one would want to observe the use of safety gear, such as helmets and protective clothing, and the implementation of proper debris-clearing methods, such as the use of specialized equipment or the organization of a coordinated rescue team.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible safety gear worn by individuals in the image.\n2. Describe observable debris-clearing methods or equipment.\n3. Assess the safety and efficiency of the rescue operation depicted.",
