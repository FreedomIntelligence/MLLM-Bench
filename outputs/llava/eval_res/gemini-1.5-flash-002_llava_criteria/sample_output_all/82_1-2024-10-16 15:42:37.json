    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDeduce the type of materials (e.g., oil paint, acrylic, watercolor) that may have been used in creating these paintings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it is likely that the artist used watercolor or a similar transparent medium to create these flower paintings. The paintings have a light, watery appearance, and the flowers are depicted in various shades and colors, which are characteristic features of watercolor paintings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe paintings appear to be done in **oil paints** or possibly **acrylics** with a heavy impasto technique.  The thick, textured application of paint with visible brushstrokes is characteristic of both mediums.  Watercolor wouldn't achieve this level of texture and three-dimensionality.  The slight glossiness also suggests oil paint, but it could be a glossy acrylic medium.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify texture and thickness indicative of oil or acrylic paint.\n2. Note color vibrancy and potential paint transparency suggesting watercolor.\n3. Assess brushwork and layering that could distinguish material types.",
