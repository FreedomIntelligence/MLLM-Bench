    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the image in detail. Which bible verse perfectly describes this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere's a description of the image and a suitable Bible verse:\n\n**Image Description:**\n\nThe image is a surreal landscape photograph. A large, open book lies on the ground, its pages forming a winding path that stretches across a verdant field under a partly cloudy sky. An elderly man, slightly hunched over, is studying the path closely, as if contemplating his journey. A small wooden signpost pointing towards the path reads \"RIGHT PATH.\" In the distance, two tiny figures are visible walking along the path. The overall mood is peaceful, contemplative, and suggestive of a journey of faith or self-discovery. The colors are soft and muted, enhancing the serene atmosphere.\n\n**Suitable Bible Verse:**\n\nSeveral verses could work, depending on the interpretation, but **Psalm 23:3** is a strong contender:\n\n*\"He refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake.\"*\n\nThis verse speaks directly to the themes of guidance, the right path, and spiritual refreshment, all of which are visually represented in the image. The man's contemplation of the path, the path itself being a book (representing scripture), and the overall peaceful scene all align with the idea of God guiding and refreshing the soul.  Other verses focusing on God's guidance or the importance of following His word could also be considered.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man standing in a grassy field with a giant book under his feet. There are also two smaller books in the scene. The man appears to be reading the book and may be surprised by its massive size. The image seems to be a creative and surreal depiction, with the man potentially engaged in some kind of fantastical or imaginative scenario.\n\nA fitting bible verse to describe this picture would be Psalm 40:4: \"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.\" This verse emphasizes the value of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and could be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of reading and learning throughout life. In the context of the image, the man's engagement with the giant book may symbolize a pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, as well as an appreciation for the power of literature and imagination.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the man, open book path, sign \"RIGHT PATH\", and relate to Psalm 119:105.\n2. Explain how the image metaphorically represents the given bible verse.",
