    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCritique the ad's implication of female competence and its potential impact on stereotypes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a woman opening a bottle of ketchup, with the phrase \"you mean a woman can open it\" in white text, which implies that it is usually associated with men. This kind of stereotype perpetuates the notion that women are not as capable as men in tasks that involve physical strength and dexterity. This can have negative consequences on societal expectations and attitudes towards women, leading to a lack of opportunities, unequality, and limited perception of women's abilities. Such an advertisement may also promote the idea that women need to prove their competence in performing tasks that are typically considered \"manly\", reinforcing gender stereotypes and limiting the potential of women.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis vintage ketchup advertisement relies on a deeply ingrained gender stereotype to sell its product.  The implication is that women are physically incapable or at least less capable than men of opening a bottle of ketchup, hence the surprised and almost incredulous tone of the caption, \"You mean a woman can open it?\"\n\nThe ad's impact on stereotypes is profoundly negative. It reinforces the idea of women as weak, delicate, and in need of special consideration (or products designed for their supposed limitations).  It subtly suggests that women are not as strong or resourceful as men, limiting their perceived capabilities and contributing to a broader societal devaluation of female strength and competence.  The ad plays on the expectation that women are primarily concerned with domestic tasks and their appearance (note the emphasis on her makeup and hairstyle), further reinforcing traditional gender roles.\n\nThe advertisement's humor is derived precisely from the subversion of this expectation, but the subversion itself is problematic.  It highlights the stereotype before subtly challenging it, which ultimately serves to reinforce the very stereotype it attempts to undermine.  The ad's impact is likely to be more damaging than beneficial, as the underlying message of female inadequacy is likely to resonate more strongly than the fleeting moment of surprise at a woman's ability to open a bottle.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response recognizes the ad's implied message about female competence.\n2. Assess the response's insight on the ad's reinforcement or challenge of gender stereotypes.\n3. Evaluate the response's consideration of the potential societal impact of such stereotypes.",
