    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSeveral elements combine to make this cow's portrait comical:\n\n* **The extreme close-up and low angle:**  The perspective distorts the cow's features, making the nose appear enormous and dominating the frame. This exaggerated proportion is inherently funny.\n* **The wide-angle lens:** This further distorts the perspective, adding to the comical effect.\n* **The tongue:**  The cow's long, pink tongue hanging out to the side adds a silly, almost goofy element to the image. It's unexpected and breaks the usual dignified image of a cow.\n* **The nose:**  The texture and detail of the large nose, captured so closely, are unusual and slightly absurd, contributing to the humor.\n* **The slight upward tilt of the head:** This, combined with the tongue, gives the impression that the cow is being playful or mischievous.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
