    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image suggests a few potential relationships between the individuals, with the most likely being a business meeting:\n\n* **Job Interview:** The woman in denim shaking hands with the man could be a candidate being interviewed.  The man's attire and positioning at the head of the table suggest he's in a position of authority, possibly a hiring manager. The woman in orange could be an HR representative or another interviewer, observing and taking notes. Her supportive and engaged posture, leaning in and smiling, indicates she's involved in the process.\n\n* **Client Meeting:**  The woman in denim could be a client meeting with the man and his colleague (the woman in orange).  The handshake could signify the beginning or end of the meeting, sealing a deal, or establishing a professional connection. The presence of documents and a tablet on the table supports this interpretation.\n\n* **Consultant/Contractor Meeting:** Similar to the client meeting scenario, the woman in denim could be a consultant or contractor finalizing an agreement with the company represented by the man and woman in orange.\n\n* **Internal Meeting/Promotion:** While less likely given the formality of the handshake, it's possible this is an internal meeting. The handshake could be congratulatory, perhaps for a promotion or successful project completion. The woman in orange could be a colleague or supervisor.\n\n**Nuances supporting the business context:**\n\n* **Formal Handshake:** The handshake itself is quite formal, suggesting a professional rather than personal relationship.\n* **Business Attire:** The man's blazer and the women's neat attire point to a business setting.\n* **Meeting Room Environment:** The modern office space, presence of a whiteboard (partially obscured by decorative text), table, documents, and tablet further reinforce the professional context.\n* **Body Language:** The man's smile and the woman in orange's engaged posture suggest a positive and collaborative atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the image strongly suggests a professional interaction, most likely a job interview or a business meeting.  The handshake, attire, setting, and body language all contribute to this interpretation.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
