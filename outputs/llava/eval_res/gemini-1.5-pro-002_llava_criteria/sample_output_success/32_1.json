    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of symbol is this? Identify all elements in the symbol and describe their meanings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe symbol is a recycle logo, also known as the recycling arrows symbol. The symbol is usually represented by three chasing arrows forming a triangle, with the words \"HDPE\" present below the arrows. The three chasing arrows signify the process of recycling, with each arrow representing a different stage: breaking down the used material, melting it down, and remolding it into new products. The \"HDPE\" stands for high-density polyethylene, which is a type of plastic commonly used for bottles and containers. This symbol is used to indicate the recyclability of HDPE materials and encourages people to recycle items made of this type of plastic.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis symbol is a **resin identification code (RIC)**, also known as a **recycling symbol**. It's used to identify the type of plastic resin used to make a product, which can be helpful for recycling purposes.\n\nThe elements of the symbol are:\n\n* **The chasing arrows triangle:** This is the universal symbol for recycling. The three arrows represent the three steps of the recycling process: collection, reprocessing, and purchase of recycled products.\n* **The number \"2\" inside the triangle:** This indicates the type of plastic resin. In this case, \"2\" stands for **High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)**.  HDPE is a versatile plastic known for its strength, durability, and resistance to moisture and chemicals. It is commonly used for milk jugs, detergent bottles, shampoo bottles, some plastic bags, and certain types of pipes.\n* **The letters \"HDPE\" below the triangle:** This is the abbreviation for the resin type, confirming that the plastic is High-Density Polyethylene.\n\nThe presence of this symbol doesn't automatically guarantee that the product is recyclable in all locations, as local recycling programs vary. However, it helps identify the plastic type, making it easier to determine if it can be recycled in a specific area.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify symbol as resin identification code for HDPE, which is the abbreviation of High-Density Polyethylene.\n2. Explain the meaning of the triangular shape and the number 2 inside it.",
