    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit is used to detect COVID-19 antigens (Ag).\n\n* **C (Control):**  The line next to the \"C\" is the control line.  It should *always* appear if the test has been performed correctly.  Its presence indicates that the test kit is working.\n* **T (Test):** The line next to the \"T\" is the test line.  In this image, the T line is visible. This indicates a *positive* result for COVID-19 antigens.  The person who took this test is likely infected with COVID-19.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
