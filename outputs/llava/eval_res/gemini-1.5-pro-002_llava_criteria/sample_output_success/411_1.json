    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCaption each section of the orchestra, detailing the types of instruments present and their arrangement on the stage. Describe the musicians' attire, their posture, and any visible interaction between the conductor and the orchestra members.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a large symphony orchestra gathered on a stage, performing in front of an audience. The musicians are seated on the ground in rows, each section arranged in a semi-circle around the stage. The orchestra consists of various instrumental groups, including strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion.\n\nThe strings group consists of several violins and cellos, while the woodwinds section includes clarinets, flutes, and oboes. The brass section features trumpets, trombones, and tubas, while the percussion group has percussionists holding drums and other percussion instruments.\n\nThe conductor is prominently visible at the front of the orchestra, leading the ensemble with precise hand and baton movements. The orchestra members follow the conductor's directions, with some musicians looking up to anticipate the next cue. They all maintain an attentive and focused posture, ready to play their parts in the performance.\n\nOverall, the orchestra creates a majestic and harmonious sound, highlighting the talent and dedication of the musicians to their craft.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image captures a full orchestra and choir performing in a grand concert hall.\n\n**Choir:** Located on risers at the back of the stage, the choir consists of a large number of singers, both men and women. They are dressed uniformly in black attire.  They hold their sheet music and appear to be following the conductor's direction.\n\n**Strings:** The string section occupies the central and front portion of the stage.  Violins are arranged in two groups on either side of the conductor, with violas seated inside the violins, closer to the center.  Cellos are positioned to the conductor's left, and double basses are at the far left edge of the orchestra. The musicians are dressed in formal black attire and sit with upright posture, focused on their instruments.  They are actively engaged in playing, following the conductor's cues.\n\n**Brass:** The brass section is situated behind the strings.  Trumpets and trombones are visible, with a French horn likely present but obscured in the photo. A lone trombone player stands slightly elevated on a small riser. The brass players, also in black attire, maintain a professional posture and appear to be watching the conductor.\n\n**Percussion:** The percussion section is located at the back right of the orchestra, behind the strings. A large timpani is visible, along with other percussion instruments that are difficult to identify precisely from this angle.  The percussionist is dressed in black and attentively follows the conductor.\n\n**Conductor:** The conductor stands on a podium in the center of the orchestra, facing the musicians. He is dressed in a dark suit and uses clear hand and body gestures to direct the orchestra and choir.  There is a visible connection between the conductor and the musicians, as they watch him for cues and tempo changes.\n\n\nThe overall impression is one of a professional and coordinated performance, with all sections of the orchestra and choir working together under the guidance of the conductor.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and caption different sections (strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion) and their instrument types.\n2. Describe musicians' attire and posture, ensuring accuracy and detail.\n3. Note any interaction between conductor and musicians, including gestures and expressions.",
