    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a story based on the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nToby burrowed deeper under his covers.  The hot air balloon painted on his wall seemed to mock him.  He was supposed to be soaring through multiplication tables, not hiding from them.  Seven times five.  He squeezed his eyes shut. Thirty… something.\n\nA thought bubble, fluffy and insistent, popped up above his head. Inside, his dog, Rusty, sat at a school desk, paw raised confidently.  “Thirty-five!” barked cartoon Rusty.  He was wearing a red collar, just like the real Rusty sleeping peacefully under Toby's bed.  Cartoon Rusty was surrounded by other kids, including a girl with bright yellow hair who looked suspiciously like Lily from his class. They all seemed to understand the mysteries of multiplication.\n\nToby groaned.  Even his dog, in his imagination, was better at maths than him.  He peeked out from under the covers. Real Rusty, oblivious to his dream-world brilliance, twitched his nose and let out a soft snore.  A chewed bone lay beside him on the patchwork rug.\n\nToby sighed. He knew he couldn't stay hidden forever.  Mrs. Higgins, his teacher, had warned them about the “times table test” on Monday.  He imagined Mrs. Higgins, also in his thought bubble, now towering over cartoon Rusty, who was shrinking smaller and smaller with each terrifying “seven times six?”\n\nHe kicked his legs under the duvet, accidentally hitting a toy airplane that had taken refuge under his bed.  He pulled it out, tracing its wings with his finger.  Maybe if he thought about it differently?  Seven groups of five.  He pictured seven little airplanes, each carrying five tiny passengers.  He counted them on his fingers, five, ten, fifteen… thirty-five!\n\nA small smile crept onto Toby’s face.  He sat up in bed.  Maybe seven times five wasn’t so scary after all.  He looked down at Rusty.  “Rusty,” he whispered, “what’s seven times five?”\n\nRusty, awakened by the sound of his name, stretched, yawned, and thumped his tail against the floor. He didn’t answer, of course. But somehow, Toby knew he’d get there. Even if it took a little longer than his dream-dog counterpart.  He climbed out of bed, grabbed his multiplication chart, and a pencil.  He had a feeling that today, he might just soar.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, we see a dog sitting on a mat, surrounded by an airplane and airplane toys. The dog seems to be resting and enjoying the cozy airplane-inspired bed. There are books scattered around the room, indicating that this space might be used for play, relaxation, or learning.\n\nIt's possible that the dog's owner is nearby, engaged in some activity or enjoying a meal, as there are two carrots visible on the floor, likely meant for sharing with the dog. A cup can also be seen on the floor, suggesting that the person might be having a drink while spending time with the dog.\n\nAs we look closer at the scene, we notice that the dog is carrying a book, adding a playful touch to the scene. The books' presence, along with the airplane toys, creates an imaginative and creative environment for the dog and its owner to enjoy.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes boy dreaming about math, dog attending school, and bedroom setting.\n2. Narrative coherence; beginning, middle, and end structured around the image.\n3. Creative elements that enhance the visual elements without altering them.",
