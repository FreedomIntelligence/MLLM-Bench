Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the radar chart, what does Libertarianism feature?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAccording to the chart, Libertarianism features:\n\n* **High Individualism (9/10)**\n* **High Skepticism of Authority (7/10)**\n* **High Liberty (7/10)**\n* **Moderate Scientific Method (2/10)**\n* **Low Equality (0/10)**\n* **Low Secularism (1/10)**\n* **Low Progress (3/10)**\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe radar chart shows that Libertarianism features a strong emphasis on individualism, freedom, and minimal government intervention.

This emphasis distinguishes it from other ideologies, which may prioritize collective rights, social equality, or broader governmental intervention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Libertarianism's highest score as Liberty.\n2.
