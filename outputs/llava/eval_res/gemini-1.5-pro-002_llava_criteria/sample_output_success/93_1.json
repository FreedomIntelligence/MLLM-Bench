Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I want to find similar photos like this on social media, for which sections or hashtags should I search?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo find similar photos on social media, you can search for the following sections or hashtags:\n\n1. #cityscape: This hashtag is commonly used for urban scenes, including busy streets and surrounding buildings.\n2. #citylife: Similar to #cityscape, this hashtag represents urban life and city dwellers going about their daily activities.\n3. #eveningwalk: Use this hashtag if you're looking for images of people walking in the evening, which might include the same setting as this image, such as a couple walking down a city street.\n4. #nightwalk: This hashtag is suitable if you want to find photos that depict people walking at night in cities, which can be another suitable context for the image.\n\nBy searching for these hashtags on platforms like Instagram or Twitter, you'll likely come across similar photos capturing the bustling atmosphere of city streets, with people walking or engaging in various activities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe photo appears to have been taken in Amalfi, Italy, specifically near the Duomo di Sant'Andrea.\n\nHere are some search terms you can use on social media:\n\n**Location-based:**\n\n* #amalfi\n* #amalficoast\n* #amalfiitaly\n* #positano (nearby town, often photographed similarly)\n* #campania (the region)\n* #italy\n* #italia\n* #duomosantandrea\n* #amalfiduomo\n\n**Subject/Style-based:**\n\n* #travelphotography\n* #travelgram\n* #instatravel\n* #travelitaly\n* #italianstreets\n* #streetphotography\n* #europe_gallery\n* #beautifuldestinations\n* #charmingtowns\n* #traveltheworld\n* #wanderlust\n* #exploreitaly\n* #italy_vacations\n* #italian_places\n* #goldenhour\n* #twilight\n* #cityscape\n\n**Consider also searching for the specific restaurant pictured:**\n\n* Search for \"Hotel Fontana Amalfi\" on Instagram or other platforms.
