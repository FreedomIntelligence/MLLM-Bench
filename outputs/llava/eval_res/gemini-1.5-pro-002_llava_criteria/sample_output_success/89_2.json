    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the decoration style in the image, what items in the picture reflect this style?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe decoration style leans towards **Modern Minimalist with subtle Japanese influences**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Clean lines and simple forms:** The room features a minimalist aesthetic with clean lines and a focus on functionality.  The headboard, nightstand, and lighting fixtures all exemplify this.\n* **Natural materials and colors:** The dark wood paneling and neutral color palette (white, brown, gold) create a calming and natural atmosphere, reminiscent of Japanese design principles.\n* **Japanese-inspired accents:** The ginkgo leaf wall decor is a clear nod to Japanese aesthetics.  The subtle, nature-inspired motif adds a touch of elegance without being overwhelming.\n* **Minimalist lighting:** The simple pendant light and the perforated headboard with backlighting contribute to the minimalist aesthetic and create a peaceful ambiance. The geometric shape of the pendant light adds a modern touch.\n\nThe combination of these elements creates a space that is both modern and serene, drawing inspiration from Japanese design while maintaining a minimalist core.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe decoration style in the image appears to be modern and contemporary. This is reflected in the use of white and brown tones, as well as the clean and sleek design. The bedroom features a white bed, a wall adorned with modern art, and brown wooden headboard, which contribute to the overall contemporary atmosphere. Additionally, the presence of a wall sconce provides a touch of modern elegance. Overall, these elements work together to create an inviting and stylish bedroom environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
