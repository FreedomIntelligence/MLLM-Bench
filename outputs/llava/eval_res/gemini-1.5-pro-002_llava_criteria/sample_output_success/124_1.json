    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the woman's emotional state by examining her gaze and the placement of her hand, considering the potential symbolism of the blurred lights in the background.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a black veil and looking to her left side with tearful eyes. The hand that she is holding out appears to be in front of her face, which might indicate that she is blocking her face from the viewer or trying to conceal her emotions. This, in combination with the background where the lights are blurred, creates a somewhat mysterious and potentially symbolic atmosphere. It might suggest the woman is going through an emotional experience or dealing with a challenging situation, and the blurred lights could represent the confusion or the complexity of her emotions at that moment. The woman's gaze and her hand's position also suggest vulnerability, and the blurred lights in the background contribute to a sense of introspection and reflection on her emotions and experiences.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman appears to be in a state of sadness and perhaps longing.  Several cues suggest this:\n\n* **Tears:** The visible tear tracks on her face are a clear indicator of sadness or distress.\n* **Gaze:** Her gaze is unfocused and directed past the camera, suggesting she's lost in thought and possibly reflecting on something painful or absent.  This lack of direct engagement with the viewer creates a sense of isolation and introspection.\n* **Hand Placement:** Her raised hand, fingers slightly spread, against what appears to be a window, could be interpreted in several ways.  It might be a gesture of reaching out for something or someone just beyond her grasp.  It could also be seen as a protective barrier, as if she's shielding herself from the outside world or holding back her emotions. The slight blur of the hand, like the lights, adds to the sense of emotional distance.\n* **Blurred Lights:** The bokeh effect of the blurred lights in the background adds to the overall mood. They could symbolize memories, lost opportunities, or the bustling world outside that she feels disconnected from. The cool tones of the lights contribute to the melancholic atmosphere.  The contrast between the bright, blurred lights and her relatively dark figure further emphasizes her emotional state, suggesting she feels separate from the vibrancy of life around her.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a woman grappling with strong emotions, likely sadness and a sense of loss or yearning. The combination of her tearful face, distant gaze, and the raised hand, coupled with the symbolic blurred lights, creates a powerful image of vulnerability and emotional isolation.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's emotional state  as sadness, regret, or perhaps a sense of longing.",
