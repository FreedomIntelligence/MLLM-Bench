    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, infer the type of event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, where several people are standing in front of voting booths with American flags nearby and are using electronic voting machines, it can be inferred that a political event is taking place. This event could be a primary election, a caucus, or another type of electoral process. The presence of a crowd and the use of electronic voting equipment indicate that the event is organized and possibly has a significant impact on the public's political choices or decisions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAn election.  People are using voting booths, which are clearly marked with American flags and the word \"Vote\". This strongly indicates a U.S. election is taking place.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as an election based on visual cues such as voting booths and flags.\n2. Mention the presence of people casting votes to support the event type.\n3. Note any signage or symbols that directly indicate voting or elections.",
