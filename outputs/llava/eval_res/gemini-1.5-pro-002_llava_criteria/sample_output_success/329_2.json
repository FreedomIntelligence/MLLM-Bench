    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image quality is decent, but not high-resolution. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Resolution:** The image appears to be compressed and likely taken from a video still or a lower-resolution source.  It's not sharp and details are somewhat blurry, particularly in the background.\n* **Focus:** The phone itself is relatively in focus, but the background is out of focus, likely a deliberate stylistic choice to draw attention to the phone.\n* **Lighting:** The lighting is adequate, but not particularly dynamic. It seems to be natural light, possibly slightly overcast.  There's no strong contrast or dramatic shadows.\n* **Composition:** The composition is simple and effective, focusing on the phone and the hand holding it. The text overlay is clear and easy to read.\n* **Overall:**  It serves its purpose of showcasing the phone and the game of Snake, but it's not a high-quality image suitable for large prints or detailed analysis. It's more suited for online use in a context where high resolution isn't paramount.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3. Assess the visibility and legibility of the text \"Love Playing Snake?\".",
