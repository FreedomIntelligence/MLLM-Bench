    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpre the man's facial expression, what might lead to this?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe man's facial expression in the image seems to display a mix of surprise, frustration, and indignance. He is holding a rotary dial telephone over his shoulder and appears to be shouting into it. His displeasure might be caused by various factors, such as receiving unexpected or unwanted news or encountering an issue with the telephone itself, like difficulty understanding or hearing the other person, or even being faced with a situation that triggered his angry reaction. It is essential to note that the exact cause of his reaction cannot be definitively determined from the image alone, but it is clear that he is not pleased with the situation he is experiencing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe man's facial expression shows anger and frustration. His eyes are squeezed shut, his mouth is wide open in a yell, and his brow is furrowed.  He's clearly upset about something he's hearing or experiencing on the phone call.\n\nSeveral things could lead to this expression:\n\n* **A frustrating conversation:** He could be dealing with a difficult client, a confusing automated system, bad news, or an argument with someone on the other end of the line.\n* **Technical difficulties:**  Perhaps the connection is bad, he keeps getting disconnected, or he can't understand the person he's talking to.\n* **Stressful situation:** The phone call could be related to a high-stakes situation, like a critical business deal, a family emergency, or a time-sensitive problem.\n* **Personal issues:**  While the context suggests a work-related scenario, underlying personal stress could be exacerbating his reaction to the phone call.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the specific facial expression (e.g., anger, frustration) and its intensity.",
