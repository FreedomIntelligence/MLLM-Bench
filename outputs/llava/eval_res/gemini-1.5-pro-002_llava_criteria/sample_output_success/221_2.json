    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the interaction between the shark and the smaller fish, discuss why the small fish swimming near the shark are not attacked and categorize the relationship accordingly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe smaller fish, likely pilotfish, are swimming very close to the shark, even appearing to touch it.  They aren't being attacked because this relationship is mutually beneficial, a form of symbiosis called **mutualism**, specifically **cleaning symbiosis**.\n\nThe pilotfish eat parasites and dead skin from the shark's body, providing a cleaning service.  In return, the pilotfish get a free meal and protection from other predators who wouldn't dare approach a shark.  The shark benefits from improved hygiene and health.  The pilotfish are also thought to consume scraps of food left over from the shark's meals.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe shark is seen swimming next to the small fish, but the smaller fish are not attacked. This suggests a symbiotic relationship between the two species. The small fish, possibly barberfish, are known for providing protection to sharks and other large marine predators like turtles. These small fish feed on parasites like shrimp and other bacteria that attach to the sharks' skin. This process helps the sharks maintain a healthy skin and overall health by removing these parasites. In return, the sharks offer protection to the small fish by keeping potential predators at a distance. This mutualistic relationship benefits both parties, with the shark gaining a cleaner and healthier skin and the small fish gaining protection from potential threats.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The group of smaller fish are swimming near the shark without being attack.\n2. Point out that the small fish are likely to be a type of pilot fish or remora.\n3. The shark receives cleaning service from these fish, which is why the latter are not attacked.\n4. Categorize the relationship as symbiosis.",
