    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBriefly describe the topic of the speech, identify and explain the rhetorical codes used in the speech.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe speech is about the importance of education and college entrance exams. It highlights the necessity of these exams, as they play a crucial role in students' access to higher education. The speaker stresses the value of the tests, emphasizing that they provide a competitive platform for students to showcase their abilities and secure admission to prestigious universities.\n\nThe speech uses anecdotal evidence, presenting stories of successful students who have benefited from the exams. The rhetorical code used here is the appeal to logos, which emphasizes the logical reasoning behind the necessity of entrance exams. The speaker also employs the rhetorical code of pathos by sharing personal stories, making a more emotional appeal to the audience. Moreover, the use of the rhetorical code of ethos is seen in the speech, as the speaker's authority and credibility are reinforced through the sharing of testimonials from successful students. Overall, the speech effectively utilizes a mix of logical, emotional, and ethical appeals to emphasize the importance of college entrance exams.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis speech argues for the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.  The speaker presents three main reasons: fairness, growth, and standardized evaluation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the rhetorical codes used:\n\n* **Logos (Logic):** The speaker uses logical reasoning to support their claims. For example, they argue that without entrance exams, admission would be based on factors like family background, creating an unfair system. They also point out that standardized exams provide a consistent way to evaluate students compared to varying school grading systems.\n\n* **Pathos (Emotion):**  The speaker appeals to emotion by highlighting the opportunity entrance exams provide for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to change their fates. This evokes a sense of hope and emphasizes the potential for upward mobility.\n\n* **Ethos (Credibility):** The speaker uses a quote from Einstein to bolster their argument about the importance of learning beyond memorization.  Invoking a respected figure lends credibility to their point about the value of these exams in fostering critical thinking.\n\n* **Hypophora:** The speaker poses questions and then immediately answers them. This is evident when they ask how universities would admit students without exams and then suggest it would likely be based on family background. This technique engages the audience and guides them through the speaker's reasoning.\n\n* **Anaphora:** The repetition of \"they have\" when describing the advantages of students from privileged backgrounds emphasizes the disparity and strengthens the argument for fairness.\n\n* **Antithesis:** The contrast between family background/money and hard work/ability highlights the fairness of entrance exams as a level playing field.\n\n* **Metaphor:**  Referring to the exams as \"keys to the future\" creates a vivid image of opportunity and potential. This metaphor reinforces the importance of these exams in shaping students' futures.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the speech's topic as the necessity of college entrance exams for high school students.\n2. Highlight rhetorical devices used: Hypophora, Anaphora, Antithesis, Ethos, Metaphor.\n3.
