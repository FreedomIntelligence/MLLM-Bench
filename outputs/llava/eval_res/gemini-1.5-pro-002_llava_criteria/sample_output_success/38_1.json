    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis is a replica or novelty badge inspired by the fictional Mayberry Sheriff's Department from *The Andy Griffith Show*.  There was no actual Mayberry, and the show's badges were props.  While this badge borrows elements common to real sheriff's badges (the star shape, the \"SHERIFF\" text), several details point to it not being a genuine law enforcement badge:\n\n* **\"Mayberry\" Text:**  The most obvious indicator.  Mayberry is a fictional town.\n* **Design and Material:** The badge has a very polished, almost toy-like appearance.  Real badges, even decorative ones, tend to have more heft and a less shiny finish. The beaded border is also a stylistic choice not typically seen on authentic badges.\n* **Central Star:** While stars are common, the plain, flat, white star is simplistic compared to the detailing often found on genuine badges.\n* **Lack of Specific County/State:** Real sheriff's badges almost always specify the county or jurisdiction they represent, often with state identification as well.\n\nTherefore, while this badge is a fun item for fans of *The Andy Griffith Show*, it is not a real law enforcement badge.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
