    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Privacy:**\n\n* **Moderate for Master Bedroom:** The master bedroom has its own en-suite bathroom, offering some privacy. However, its proximity to the living area might allow noise to travel.\n* **Low for other Bedrooms:** The two smaller bedrooms share a wall and are close to the living area and each other, offering minimal noise isolation.  Bedroom 3 is particularly vulnerable as it is adjacent to the living room and close to the main entrance.\n* **Prayer Room offers potential privacy:** Located away from the bedrooms, the prayer room could provide a quiet, private space.\n\n**Accessibility to Communal Areas:**\n\n* **Good flow between living, dining, and kitchen:** The open plan design creates a good flow between these areas, promoting interaction and ease of movement.\n* **Easy access to living room from bedrooms:** All bedrooms have relatively direct access to the living area.\n* **Slightly inconvenient bathroom access for Bedroom 3:**  While Bedroom 3 is close to a bathroom, it's not an ensuite and requires passing through a potentially busy area of the house.\n* **Staircase location is potentially disruptive:**  The staircase's location between the dining area and the master bedroom could lead to noise and traffic disrupting both spaces.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe floor plan prioritizes communal living over individual privacy.  While the open-plan design fosters a sense of togetherness, it compromises the acoustic privacy of the bedrooms, especially the two smaller ones.  The location of the staircase could also be problematic.  The design might be suitable for a small family or individuals who prioritize shared living, but it might not be ideal for those who desire more privacy and quiet in their bedrooms.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
