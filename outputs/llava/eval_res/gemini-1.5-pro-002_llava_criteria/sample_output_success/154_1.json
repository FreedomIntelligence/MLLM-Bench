    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a disciplined military ceremony, likely the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace.  Elements of discipline and ceremony include:\n\n* **Uniformity:** The guards are identically dressed in their iconic red tunics and bearskin hats, demonstrating a high level of uniformity and attention to detail.  This uniformity extends to their weapons and equipment.\n* **Precision marching:** The guards are marching in a precise and coordinated manner, maintaining even spacing and executing movements simultaneously.  This requires extensive training and discipline.\n* **Formal bearing:**  The guards maintain a stiff, upright posture and controlled movements, projecting an air of formality and seriousness.\n* **Carrying of colours:**  The presence of a regimental colour (flag) adds to the ceremonial aspect of the event.  The colour guard carries and protects the flag with reverence, signifying the regiment's history and honour.\n* **Synchronized movements:**  The guards move their rifles and perform other actions in perfect unison, demonstrating rigorous training and adherence to protocol.\n* **Presence of a lead officer:**  A single guard is seen marching slightly ahead and separate from the main formation, likely an officer or NCO leading the detachment. This indicates a hierarchical structure and chain of command.\n\n\nThese elements combine to create a visually impressive and highly formalized ceremony, reflecting the traditions and discipline of the British military.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3. Mention the context suggesting a multicultural event.",
