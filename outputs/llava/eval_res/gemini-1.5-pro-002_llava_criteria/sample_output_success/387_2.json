    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe white car appears to be turning left while the darker car is moving straight ahead at a higher speed.  Given their current trajectories and speeds, a collision is possible in the next few seconds.\n\nTo avoid a collision, the drivers could take the following actions:\n\n* **Darker car (likely the primary risk):** The driver of the darker car needs to brake immediately and potentially steer slightly to the right to increase the distance from the white car.  Given the snowy conditions, braking hard could lead to a loss of control, so careful modulation of the brakes is essential.\n* **White car:** The driver of the white car should also be cautious. While they appear to be turning, they should ensure they aren't cutting off the darker car.  They could potentially slow down their turn slightly to give the darker car more time to react.\n\n**Crucially, both drivers need to be aware of the hazardous conditions (snow and darkness) and adjust their driving accordingly.**  Reduced visibility and slippery roads necessitate slower speeds and increased following distances.  Overconfidence in these conditions is a major contributing factor to accidents.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
