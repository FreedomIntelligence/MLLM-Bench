    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the primary structure in the image and describe its architectural style and features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe primary structure in the image is the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge in New York City, built in 1883. It spans over the East River, connecting the borough of Brooklyn with Manhattan. The bridge has a distinctive twin-tower design, with two towers at the abutments on each end of the bridge. These towers house the cable supports and carry the weight of the suspended bridge deck, which is suspended from them. The bridge's architectural style is a blend of Gothic and Romanesque influences, making it an important historical and cultural landmark.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary structure in the image is the **Manhattan Bridge**.  While the street and buildings form the immediate foreground, the bridge is the clear focal point and the subject that organizes the composition.\n\nThe Manhattan Bridge is an example of a **suspension bridge**, specifically a **steel suspension bridge**. Its architectural style can be described as **utilitarian yet elegant**, reflecting the engineering prowess of the early 20th century.  Key features include:\n\n* **Suspension Towers:**  The massive steel towers that support the main cables are prominent.  They have a characteristic cross-bracing pattern for stability.\n* **Suspension Cables:**  The thick cables that drape between the towers and hold up the bridge deck are a defining feature of this type of bridge.\n* **Bridge Deck:**  The roadway and walkways suspended from the cables are visible, although the details are obscured by distance.\n* **Steel Construction:** The use of steel throughout gives the bridge a strong, industrial aesthetic.\n\n\nThe buildings lining the street appear to be a mix of styles, possibly including some elements of pre-war architecture and renovated industrial buildings.  They are generally multi-story and made of brick or concrete.  The cobblestone street adds a historical touch to the urban scene.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the primary structure as a bridge.\n2. Describe the architectural style of the bridge (e.g., suspension, cable-stayed).\n3. Mention specific features of the bridge (e.g., towers, cables).",
