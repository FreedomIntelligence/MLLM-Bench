    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis fish appears to be a type of wrasse, possibly a **Green Birdmouth Wrasse** ( *Gomphosus caeruleus* ), although the image quality makes definitive identification challenging.  Here's a description based on the image:\n\n* **Body Shape:**  Fusiform, meaning it's elongated and somewhat torpedo-shaped, tapering towards both the head and tail.\n* **Coloration:** Predominantly green on the body. The head appears to have a bluish tinge, especially around the mouth area.  There's a hint of yellow on the pectoral fins.  The tail fin and the rear part of the dorsal and anal fins appear darker, possibly black or very dark blue.\n* **Head:**  Distinctive \"bird-like\" mouth, which is small and slightly pointed. This is a key feature of birdmouth wrasses.\n* **Fins:**  The pectoral fins seem relatively small and translucent with a yellowish tint. The dorsal fin runs along most of the back.  The caudal (tail) fin is likely rounded or truncate (straight across), but it's difficult to see clearly.\n* **Size:** It's hard to judge size from the picture without a reference, but birdmouth wrasses can reach up to about 12 inches (30 cm) in length.  This individual appears to be smaller, perhaps a juvenile or subadult.\n\nTo confirm the species, more details would be helpful, such as:\n\n* **Clearer view of the tail fin shape:** Is it rounded, forked, or truncate?\n* **Details of the dorsal and anal fins:** Are there any spots or markings?\n* **A view from the side:** This would help confirm the overall body shape and coloration.\n* **Location where the photo was taken:** Knowing the geographic region helps narrow down the possibilities.\n\nIf you can provide more information, a more precise identification might be possible.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
