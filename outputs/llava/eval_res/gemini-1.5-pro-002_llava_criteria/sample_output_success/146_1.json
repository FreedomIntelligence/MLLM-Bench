    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe exaggeration lies in the \"after coffee\" cat's wildly different expression.  Its eyes are comically wide, almost bulging, creating a sense of manic energy.  The open mouth and slight grimace/smile further amplify this, suggesting an almost deranged level of excitement.  This is a stark contrast to the \"before coffee\" cat, which appears grumpy and half-asleep with narrowed eyes.\n\nThe hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor by taking a relatable experience – the energizing effect of coffee – to an absurd extreme.  Most people feel more awake and alert after coffee, but the cat's exaggerated reaction implies a transformation into a state of near-lunacy.  This extreme difference between the two images, along with the implied anthropomorphism (attributing human-like coffee dependence to a cat), creates a humorous disconnect and makes the meme funny.  It plays on the common trope of coffee being a necessary crutch for functioning in the morning, making light of the sometimes desperate need for caffeine.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
