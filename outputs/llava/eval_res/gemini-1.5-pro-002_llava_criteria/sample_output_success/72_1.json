    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer the activities that are likely to take place during the scene based on the objects present.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn this scene, a variety of items are laid out on a blanket at the beach, suggesting that a relaxing and leisurely outdoor activity is about to take place. There is a bottle of wine, likely to be enjoyed during a sunset picnic, and a book, which indicates that someone might be reading or unwinding on the beach. Additionally, there are oranges and sunflowers, which suggest that the person might be enjoying a healthy snack while soaking in the picturesque beach atmosphere. There is also a handbag in the scene, which could potentially belong to the person having the picnic. Overall, the setting appears to be a pleasant and serene environment for unwinding and enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the beach.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe scene depicts a sunset picnic overlooking the ocean.  The following activities are likely taking place or have taken place:\n\n\n* **Eating and drinking:** There are apricots, corn on the cob, a bottle and what appears to be a carafe of rosé wine, and a glass with an amber liquid, possibly another alcoholic beverage or juice. This suggests a meal or snack is being enjoyed.\n* **Relaxing and enjoying the view:** The beautiful sunset and ocean vista, combined with the picnic blanket and relaxed setting, strongly suggest the primary activity is enjoying the scenery and atmosphere.\n* **Reading:** An open book is present, indicating someone might be reading or has been reading.  The map inside suggests perhaps they are planning a trip or reminiscing about past travels.\n* **Conversation:** Picnics are often social events, so it's likely there is conversation happening, or has happened, between the people enjoying the picnic.\n* **Taking photos:** The picturesque setting makes it very likely someone has or will take photos of the sunset, the food, and the overall scene.\n\n\nIt's less likely, but possible, that other activities are also taking place, such as:\n\n\n* **Birdwatching:**  The elevated position overlooking the ocean could be a good spot for birdwatching.\n* **Stargazing:** If they stay after sunset, stargazing might become an activity.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity 'picnic' based on the presence of a blanket, food items, and outdoor setting.\n2. Confirm objects like a book, sun hat, and beach bag support leisure activities.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the seaside environment suggesting relaxation or dining.",
