    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven an image of an e-mail, determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe author's primary intention behind sending the email is likely to inform the recipient about three urgent updates, possibly related to politics or a specific event. The email includes a smiling man wearing a blue shirt, suggesting that the recipient might be familiar with the person or the situation described in the email. The presence of a flag in the image and the name \"Mike Johnson\" may provide additional context or information about the updates the recipient should be aware of.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary intention of the email is political fundraising.  Mike Johnson is highlighting what he presents as urgent reasons for recipients to donate to the Republican party: upcoming special elections, Democratic fundraising success, and the slim Republican majority in the House. By emphasizing these points, he aims to create a sense of urgency and motivate recipients to contribute financially to the Republican cause.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the email's purpose is to inform, request action, or another intention.\n2. Assess how the email's content supports the identified primary intention.\n3. Determine the relevance of updates mentioned to the email's primary intention.",
