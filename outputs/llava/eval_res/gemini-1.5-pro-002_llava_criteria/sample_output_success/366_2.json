    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe fog hung heavy, a white curtain drawn across the world, obscuring everything beyond a few feet.  The road, a dark ribbon bisected by a faded yellow line, stretched ahead, disappearing into the swirling mist.  It was a road less traveled, a road whispered about in hushed tones, a road that promised… something.  Freedom, perhaps. Or maybe just the unknown.\n\nElias hung suspended mid-leap, a fleeting moment of weightlessness captured against the stark canvas of fog and sky.  He’d been walking for what felt like days, the city a distant memory, a life shed like an old skin.  The weight of expectation, the suffocating routine, the constant hum of dissatisfaction - all left behind at the edge of the fog.\n\nThis road, this fog, was a baptism.  A cleansing.  He’d stepped into the unknown with nothing but the clothes on his back and a heart full of a strange, exhilarating fear.  The fog was a metaphor, he realized, as his feet touched the asphalt again.  It represented the uncertainty, the blurry edges of his future.  He couldn't see what lay ahead, but that was the point.  He wasn’t supposed to.\n\nEach step forward was an act of faith.  The fog muffled the world, creating an almost sacred silence.  There were no distractions here, no billboards screaming for his attention, no cacophony of city noise. Just the rhythmic crunch of his shoes on the road, the whisper of the fog against his skin, and the steady beat of his own heart.\n\nHe walked for hours, the fog sometimes thinning, offering glimpses of shadowy trees or rolling hills, then thickening again, swallowing the landscape whole.  The yellow line, his only constant companion, snaked ahead, a thread of gold leading him deeper into the mystery.\n\nSometimes, doubt gnawed at him.  Was he making a mistake?  Was this freedom or folly?  But then he’d remember the tightness in his chest, the dull ache in his soul that had plagued him before.  He’d remember the feeling of being trapped, of living a life that wasn’t his own.  And he’d keep walking.\n\nAs the sun began to set, painting the fog in hues of orange and pink, a sense of peace settled over him. He didn’t know where he was going, but he knew he was on the right path.  The fog, once a symbol of fear, now felt like a comforting embrace.  It was a reminder that life wasn't about seeing the destination, but about the journey itself.  About embracing the unknown, about finding freedom in the fog.  And as he walked on, into the deepening twilight, he knew that somewhere beyond the mist, a new beginning awaited.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3. Incorporates the visual of the person jumping as part of the narrative.",
