    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify a hair dryer in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere isn't a conventional hair dryer depicted in the image.  The closest item is a black, cylindrical object near the bottom center that could possibly be the barrel of a hair dryer without the handle and nozzle. However, given the other items present, it's more likely to be a styling iron or curling iron.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, there is a hair dryer in the image, which is placed next to a mirror and surrounded by cosmetics and other beauty supplies.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
