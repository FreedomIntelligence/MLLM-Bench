    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIs it possible for the player in the image to score points in the next 0.1 second?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nNo.  He's dribbling the ball and not close to the basket. In 0.1 seconds, he won't be able to shoot, let alone score. He's likely still dribbling or just beginning a move towards the basket in that short timeframe.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSince the basketball player in the image is running with the ball, it is likely that he is attempting to score points in the next 0.1 second. However, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of his attempt without further information about the current game situation or his performance at that moment. The player's chances of scoring depend on factors such as the position of his teammates and opponents, his own skill level, and his ability to make quick decisions and execute the right moves.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the player's body and ball position suggest imminent scoring action.\n2. Determine proximity to the basket and potential defenders' positions.\n3. Evaluate movement direction and momentum for scoring likelihood: impossible",
