    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSeveral circumstances could lead to this scenario:\n\n* **Slip and fall:** The most obvious explanation.  The floor looks polished and could be slippery.  The scattered papers suggest he was carrying them when he fell. The caution sign further supports this possibility.\n* **Medical emergency:** He could have suffered a heart attack, stroke, seizure, or fainted.  The papers would have fallen as he collapsed.\n* **Intoxication:**  Alcohol or drug use could have led to a loss of coordination and a fall.\n* **Stress or exhaustion:**  Overwork, lack of sleep, or emotional distress could cause someone to collapse, especially if combined with a medical condition like low blood sugar.\n* **Prank or staged photo:** Though less likely, it's possible the scene is staged for a photo or as a prank.  The presence of the caution sign could be part of the setup.\n* **Assault:** While there's no direct evidence, it's possible he was assaulted and his belongings scattered.  This is less likely given the lack of visible injuries or signs of a struggle.\n\n\nIt's important to note that without more information, it's impossible to determine the exact cause.  The presence of the caution sign suggests a wet floor is a strong possibility.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
