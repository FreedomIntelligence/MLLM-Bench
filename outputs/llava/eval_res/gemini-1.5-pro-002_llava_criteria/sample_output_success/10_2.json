Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich dishes can have extra ingredients added, and what is the cost of adding ingredients?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe following dishes can have extra ingredients added, along with the cost:\n\n* **Tomato & Onion Salad:** Add blue cheese for £1.\n* **Bruschetta al Pomodoro:** Add grilled goat's cheese for £1.\n* **Cocktail di Gamberi Rossi:** Add smoked salmon for £1.\n* **Pane all 'Aglio:**  Mozzarella cheese (£2), fresh rosemary & sea salt (£1), tomato & fresh basil (£1), goats cheese & caramelised onion (£2), rocket & parma ham (£2).\n* **Cesare Salad:** Add grilled chicken for £2.\n* **Spaghetti Carbonara:** Add chicken for £2.\n\n\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nSeveral dishes on the menu allow for the addition of extra ingredients.
