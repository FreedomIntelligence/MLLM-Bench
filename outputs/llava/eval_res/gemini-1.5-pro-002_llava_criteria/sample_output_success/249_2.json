    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows Earth and Mars, highlighting stark differences in their atmospheric and surface features.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\n* **Earth:**  Displays a thick, dynamic atmosphere with abundant white cloud formations indicative of a robust water cycle. These clouds vary in texture and distribution, suggesting different weather systems. The blue hues show the presence of liquid water oceans and a nitrogen-oxygen rich atmosphere.\n* **Mars:** Shows a thin, hazy atmosphere with a distinct orange-red tint. This color comes from iron oxide dust suspended in the atmosphere and covering much of the surface. There are some localized white patches, likely clouds of water ice or carbon dioxide ice, but far less extensive than Earth's cloud cover.  The thinness of Mars's atmosphere means it can't retain heat effectively, resulting in large temperature swings.\n\n**Surface:**\n\n* **Earth:**  Dominated by blue oceans, which cover approximately 71% of the surface.  Landmasses vary in color, from the browns and greens of vegetation to the tans and light browns of deserts.  The image clearly shows diverse geographical features, suggesting active geological processes.\n* **Mars:**  Appears primarily reddish-brown due to the widespread iron oxide.  Darker regions are visible, potentially indicating different rock compositions or areas where dust has been blown away.  Some craters are visible, suggesting a history of impacts.  While there might be subsurface ice, no liquid water is visible on the surface in this image.  The overall impression is of a dry, dusty, and less geologically active surface compared to Earth.\n\n\nIn summary, Earth's atmosphere is thick, active, and supports a water cycle leading to abundant clouds and liquid water oceans. Mars's atmosphere is thin, dusty, and cold, with limited cloud formation and no visible liquid water. Earth's surface is diverse, with oceans, continents, and active geological processes. Mars's surface is dry, dusty, and heavily cratered, with a uniform reddish-brown hue from iron oxide.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
