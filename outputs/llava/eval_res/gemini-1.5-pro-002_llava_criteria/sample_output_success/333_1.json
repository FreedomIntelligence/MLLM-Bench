    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe back glass of the phone is significantly shattered in the upper right corner.  While the extent of internal damage is impossible to determine from the image, the broken glass itself poses several problems:\n\n* **Sharp edges:** The shattered glass creates sharp edges that could cause injury to the user.\n* **Compromised protection:** The broken glass no longer provides adequate protection for the phone's internal components, making it vulnerable to dust, moisture, and further impact damage.\n* **Potential for further cracking:** The existing cracks could spread, potentially affecting the camera lens or other components.\n\nWhether the phone is *usable* without repair depends on the functionality of its internal components.  If the screen, touchscreen, and other internal parts are still working, the phone might be technically usable. However, it is **not recommended** to use it in this condition due to the safety hazards and increased risk of further damage.  Repair is necessary to restore the phone's structural integrity and protect its internal components.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
