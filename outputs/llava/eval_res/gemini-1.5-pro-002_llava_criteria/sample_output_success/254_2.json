    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are five differences between the two images:\n\n1. **Fishing Bobber:** The image on the right has a red and white bobber on the fishing line. The left image does not.\n2. **Penguin's Feet:** The penguin's feet on the right are yellow, while the penguin on the left has orange feet.\n3. **Fishing Hole:** The fishing hole in the ice on the right side is smaller than the one on the left.\n4. **Water Line:** The waterline in the background is higher on the right image than on the left.\n5. **Iceberg Shape:** The shape of the large iceberg in the background is slightly different between the two images. The peak on the right is more pointed.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are two images of a penguin sitting in the snow. The first image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and catching a fish, while the second image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and preparing to catch a fish. There are many fish in both pictures, but their positions are different. On the left, the fish are near the top-right side, and on the right, the fish are closer to the penguin. The penguin appears to be the same in both images, with no noticeable differences in its appearance. Overall, there are five differences in the image pairs, including the fish's positions, the fishing pole's orientation, and the fish's visibility.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences in penguin's left foot color, ice hole size, background iceberg, fishing line buoys, and penguin tail.",
