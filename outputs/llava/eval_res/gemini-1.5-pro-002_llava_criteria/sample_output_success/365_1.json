Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a narrative poem on political activism's fervor and the spectrum of public opinion in cityscape demonstrations.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heart of the city, on a bustling street,\nA crowd gathered, with protesters in retreat.\nTheir fervor for change, their voices united,\nIn the name of justice, they stood all conspired.\n\nOn the corner of a downtown intersection,\nA Trump placard waved with strong affliction.\nAmidst the crowd, a man raised his hand,\nWith the sign, he stood as a bold champion.\n\nIn the image, some with Trump placards in hand,\nOthers with signs, voicing their dissent.\nA diverse group of people, opinions vast,\nIn the city landscape, their voices never past.\n\nThe intersection became a platform for the clash,\nA space for voices that couldn't be rushed.\nWith traffic lights above, the scene unfolded,\nA reflection of the nation's deeply rooted.\n\nVarious viewpoints, perspectives, and beliefs,\nThe city's vibrant colors, a canvas for griefs.\nThe people's voices, like a symphony,\nEchoing throughout the bustling reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe city breathed a restless sigh, a rumble in its concrete heart,\nA tide of faces, placards high, a protest tearing it apart.\nA canvas stretched across the street, a spectrum painted bold and bright,\nFrom fiery rage to whispers sweet, bathed in the fading winter light.\n\n\"Stop Trump\" the banner loudly cried, held high by youthful, earnest hands,\nA man beside, his face with pride, a silent echo in the lands.\nA boy in blue, his gaze intent, absorbing every passing glance,\nA lesson learned, a seed now sent, in this tumultuous, civic dance.\n\nAcross the way, a different hue, a quiet murmur, barely heard,\nSome nod in silent, grudging true, some shake their heads, a bitter word.\nA woman stands, her arms crossed tight, a fortress built of worry's stone,\nAnother whispers, \"He's our right,\" a seed of discord subtly sown.\n\nThe traffic flows, a metal stream, oblivious to the human tide,\nA honking horn, a fleeting dream, against the chants that rise and ride.\nThe city watches, cold and grey, a backdrop to the human play,\nA stage where passions hold their sway, and truths and falsehoods find their way.\n\nThe air is thick with whispered fears, with hopes that flicker, barely there,\nThe weight of change, the passing years, a burden that the people share.\nAnd in the midst of all the noise, the silent questions start to bloom,\nOf fractured dreams and broken toys, a city waiting for its doom,\nOr dawn.  The answer hangs unseen, a whispered promise in the breeze,\nA future yet to be convened, on sidewalks choked with histories.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes city demonstration with a \"STOP TRUMP\" sign, reflecting political activism.\n2. Narrative captures the fervor of activism and spectrum of public opinion.\n3. Poem structure and language quality align with narrative poetry conventions.",
