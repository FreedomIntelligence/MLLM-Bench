    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical features of the twins to identify subtle differences that may distinguish them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe twins have similar physical features; however, there are subtle differences that can be observed. First, one twin has a mole on her face close to the left side of her nose, while the other has a slight gap between her eyebrows. Second, the twin on the left has longer hair, as it extends beyond the other girl's hair. These small distinctions in their features make them stand out despite their similar appearances.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThese twins are remarkably similar, but here are some subtle differences:\n\n* **Freckles:** While both have freckles, the twin on the right appears to have slightly more, and they seem a bit darker and more concentrated on her nose and cheeks.\n* **Eyebrows:** The twin on the right's eyebrows appear slightly thinner and more arched.\n* **Smile:** The twin on the left's smile is slightly wider, showing a hint more of her top teeth. The twin on the right's smile is a bit more closed-mouth.\n* **Hair Part:** The twin on the right appears to have a more defined part in her hair, slightly off-center. The twin on the left's part is less noticeable, and her hair falls more loosely.\n* **Jawline:** The twin on the left seems to have a slightly rounder jawline, while the twin on the right's is a bit more pointed.\n\n\nIt's important to note that these are very subtle differences, and lighting and posing can also affect how these features appear.  It's a testament to how close their features are!\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify facial feature differences such as freckle patterns, eye shape, or smile.\n2. Note hair texture, color variation, or hairstyle distinctions.\n3. Describe any other physical differences, like ear shape or skin tone.",
