    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe skater is mid-air, having just ollied (jumped) with his skateboard. His next move will likely be to land back on the board, aiming for the downward slope of one of the concrete transitions in the skatepark.  He's likely aiming for the transition closest to him, allowing him to ride down and gain momentum.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\n* **Moderate Risk:**  While the skater appears to be experienced (given the height and control of the ollie), there's always a risk in skateboarding.  \n* **Potential Hazards:**\n    * **Imperfect Landing:**  If he doesn't land with his feet properly positioned over the bolts of the board, the board could slip out, causing a fall.  At this height, that could lead to scrapes, bruises, sprains, or even broken bones.\n    * **Misjudging Distance/Trajectory:** He could overshoot or undershoot the landing, leading to a collision with the concrete.\n    * **Other Skaters:**  While not visible in the image, other skaters could be present in the park, creating a collision hazard.\n\nOverall, the risk is inherent in the activity, but it's likely a calculated risk for the skater.  He's in a controlled environment (a skatepark) and seems to have the skill to execute the maneuver.  However, accidents can always happen.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
