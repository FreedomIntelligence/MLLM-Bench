    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a caption that not only describes the group of people and their attire but also infers the cultural significance or occasion that might have brought them together.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe group of people in the image is all dressed in traditional Chinese clothing, showing their cultural heritage and pride. They are posing for a photo in front of a building, and some of them are giving a thumbs-up sign, signifying their happiness and excitement for the occasion. It is possible that this event could be a cultural festival, celebration, or a gathering where people are dressed in their traditional attire to honor and share their culture with others.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nResplendent in their vibrant Mongolian deels, this group proudly displays their cultural heritage.  The thumbs-up suggest a celebratory occasion, perhaps a festival, community gathering, or even a special performance near a traditional ger, adding to the rich tapestry of Mongolian life.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Description of attire and group composition (age, gender, number of people).\n2. Inference of cultural significance or specific occasion.\n3.
