    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis ECG shows normal sinus rhythm at approximately 75 beats per minute.  Here's a breakdown of the components and analysis:\n\n**ECG Waveform Components:**\n\n* **P wave:** Represents atrial depolarization (contraction).  Present and upright in leads I, II, aVF, and V2-V6.  Slightly negative in aVR (normal) and isoelectric in aVL.\n* **PR interval:**  The time from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. Represents the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel from the SA node through the atria, AV node, and His-Purkinje system. Normal duration (0.12-0.20 seconds) in this ECG.\n* **QRS complex:** Represents ventricular depolarization.  Normal duration and morphology.  Note the slight Q waves in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 - these are small and within normal limits.\n* **ST segment:** The interval between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the T wave.  Isoelectric (neither elevated nor depressed) in this ECG, which is normal.\n* **T wave:** Represents ventricular repolarization.  Upright and appropriately sized in relation to the QRS complexes.\n* **QT interval:** The time from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Represents total ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Appears normal in duration, although accurate measurement requires calculating the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc).\n* **RR interval:** The interval between two consecutive R waves.  Regular, indicating a consistent heart rate.\n\n\n**Abnormalities:**\n\n* **None:** This ECG demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm without any significant abnormalities.  All waveforms are present, appropriately sized and configured, and the intervals are within normal limits.\n\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical diagnoses.  This interpretation is for educational purposes only.  Any concerns about your ECG should be discussed with a qualified healthcare professional. They can correlate the ECG findings with your symptoms, medical history, and physical examination to provide a definitive diagnosis.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
