    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe illustration depicts four different big cats, each with distinct features:\n\n* **Tiger:**  Characterized by its vibrant orange fur with bold black vertical stripes.  Its body is long and muscular, built for stalking and ambushing prey.  The face has prominent white markings around the eyes and muzzle.\n\n* **Cougar (Puma):**  A uniformly tawny or light brown color, lacking any spots or stripes.  It has a relatively small head and a long, thick tail.  Its build is sleek and agile.\n\n* **Lion (male):**  The most recognizable feature is the thick, shaggy mane around the head and neck, a characteristic exclusive to male lions.  Its body is a uniform tawny brown, similar to the cougar but more robust.\n\n* **Lioness (with cubs):**  Like the cougar, the lioness lacks the male's mane and is a uniform tawny brown.  The presence of nursing cubs clearly distinguishes her from the cougar.  The cubs themselves exhibit faint spots, which typically fade as they mature.\n\n\nThe illustration effectively highlights the key visual differences that allow one to distinguish these big cat species.  The presence of stripes (tiger), a mane (male lion), or the absence of both (cougar, lioness) are immediate clues.  Size and build also contribute to identification, with the tiger appearing longer and leaner than the lion, and the cougar smaller than both.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
