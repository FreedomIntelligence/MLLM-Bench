    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBy integrating the expressions, actions, and attire of the characters in the image, could you please speculate on the likely age group to which they belong?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe group of people in the image are young, and they appear to be of high school age. They are dressed in caps and gowns, which are commonly attire for high school commencement ceremonies. Their actions, such as smiling, dancing, and celebrating, suggest that they are joyful about their accomplishments, further supporting the idea that they are young high school graduates.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThey are wearing graduation gowns and caps and celebrating with diplomas and confetti, indicating they've just graduated. This strongly suggests they are in the **17-23 age range**, typical for graduating high school or undergraduate university programs.  While it's *possible* some could be slightly older if they've returned to education later in life, the overall exuberance and energy of the group point towards a traditional graduation age.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if the answer determines an age group based on graduation attire and joyful expressions.\n2. Check for reasoning that associates attire with a typical graduation age group.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects understanding of actions indicating a celebration, likely a graduation event.",
