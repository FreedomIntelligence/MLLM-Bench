    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated, or more accurately, digitally manipulated/photoshopped.  Here's why:\n\n* **Scale and perspective are off:** The tsunami wave is impossibly large compared to the buildings and vehicles in the foreground.  A wave of that size would be dwarfing even the tallest buildings, not just looming over a few stories.\n* **Unrealistic wave behavior:** The curl of the wave is too perfect and stylized. Real tsunamis don't typically form such a clean, uniformly curving crest, especially so close to shore.  The froth and spray patterns also look artificial.\n* **Lighting inconsistencies:** The lighting on the wave doesn't quite match the lighting on the city.  The wave seems brighter and less affected by the cloudy sky.\n* **Objects in the wave:** The objects within the wave (like the bus) appear to be floating at unnatural angles and positions. They would be more tumbled and chaotic in a real tsunami.\n* **Overall \"too perfect\" look:**  While some disaster photos can be dramatic, this image has a staged quality.  It lacks the chaotic, unpredictable nature of a real tsunami event.\n\nWhile the city backdrop might be a real photograph, the tsunami wave has been digitally added, creating an unrealistic and manipulated image.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
