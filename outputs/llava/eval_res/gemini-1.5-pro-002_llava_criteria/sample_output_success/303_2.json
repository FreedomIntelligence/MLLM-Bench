    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat are the shapes of these two sunshades?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBoth sunshades are quadrilaterals, but more specifically they appear to be **irregular quadrangles**.  This means they have four sides, but the sides are not equal in length and the angles are not equal.  They are somewhat close to trapezoids or irregular parallelograms, but without more precise information, it's difficult to say for certain. They definitely aren't squares, rectangles, rhombuses, or kites.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two sunshades are made in the shape of triangles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies one sunshade as triangular and the other as quadrilateral.",
