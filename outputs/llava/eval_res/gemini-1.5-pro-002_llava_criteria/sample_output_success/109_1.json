Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify a hair dryer in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, there is a hair dryer in the image, which is placed next to a mirror and surrounded by cosmetics and other beauty supplies.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere isn't a conventional hair dryer depicted in the image.  The closest item is a black, cylindrical object near the bottom center that could possibly be the barrel of a hair dryer without the handle and nozzle. However, given the other items present, it's more likely to be a styling iron or curling iron.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the presence of at least one hair dryer in front of the rightmost mirror.\n2. Identify one hair dryer on the left side of the iamge and another one on the right side of the image.\n",
