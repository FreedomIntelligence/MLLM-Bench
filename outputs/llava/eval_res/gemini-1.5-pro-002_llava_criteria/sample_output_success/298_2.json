    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the size and shape of the center island and the items suspended above it, deduce if this kitchen island can be served as a dining area.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the kitchen island can be used as a dining area.  It's large enough to accommodate at least two people comfortably, potentially more depending on the size of chairs used. The pot rack hanging above is high enough to not interfere with people sitting and eating.  There's also sufficient clear space around the island for chairs to be pulled out.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the kitchen has a large center island that appears spacious and has a sink positioned towards the right side. Moreover, various items such as pots, pans, and a bowl are hanging above the island. However, the presence of hanging items, pots, and pans over the island instead of a traditional dining table suggests that the kitchen island might not serve as a dining area. Instead, it primarily functions as a workspace for food preparation and cooking.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the island's size and shape accommodate dining functions.\n2. Evaluate the practicality of suspended items for a dining area.\n3. Determine if the island's height is suitable for seated dining.",
