    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I intend to pack a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand, which container from the picture should I select?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe best container for a hand-sized sandwich would be the paper bag on the right side.  It's flexible and can accommodate various shapes, unlike the rigid containers. While the flat, rectangular tray at the bottom might also work, it doesn't offer the same protection and portability as the bag.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image and considering the size of a grown man's hand, I would recommend using the largest cup available. It is located towards the right side of the image and seems to be a good fit for the sandwich. However, it is important to keep in mind that cups are typically designed for beverages and not for housing food items like a sandwich. Therefore, you might need to use a more suitable container or wrap the sandwich securely before placing it in the cup.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify container size suitable for a grown man's hand-sized sandwich.\n2. Justify container choice based on dimensions and shape.",
