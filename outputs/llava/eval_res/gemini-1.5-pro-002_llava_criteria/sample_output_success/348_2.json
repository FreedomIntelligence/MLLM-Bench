    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze if the people in the image hold a ethical demand.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe demand to end racism is widely considered an ethical demand.  Racism, by definition, involves discrimination and prejudice based on race, leading to systemic inequalities and injustices.  Most ethical frameworks, including those based on human rights, equality, and social justice, condemn racism as morally wrong.  Therefore, calling for the end of racism aligns with these ethical principles.\n\n\nIt's important to note that while the goal of ending racism is broadly accepted as ethical, specific approaches to achieving that goal can be debated.  Different individuals and groups may have varying perspectives on the most effective strategies for combating racism, and these differences can lead to disagreements about the best course of action. However, the fundamental demand to end racism itself is rooted in ethical concerns.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the people in the image are holding up signs with political demands, which suggests that they are advocating for a particular cause or ethical position. Given the variety of signs they are holding, it indicates that they are representing diverse opinions or concerns, which is typically found in protests or demonstrations. By participating in such events, the individuals are voicing their opinions and raising awareness about the issues they consider important, with the intention of influencing societal change, policy-making, or public opinion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the image depicts a demand for ethical treatment or social justice.\n2. Evaluate the presence of signs or expressions that convey an ethical stance.\n3. Determine the context of the demand, such as anti-racism or human rights.",
