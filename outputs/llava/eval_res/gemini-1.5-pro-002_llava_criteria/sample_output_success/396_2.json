    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts the supposed evolution of humankind, but with a satirical twist on technological advancement. It starts with a primate, moves through stages resembling early hominids, then to tool-using cavemen, and ends with a modern human using a smartphone.  The trend being represented is the increasing reliance on technology and the corresponding decline in physical activity and arguably, social interaction.  Each stage shows the figure becoming more upright and less engaged with the physical world, culminating in the final figure looking down at his phone.\n\nThe next stage in this satirical depiction would likely exaggerate the current trend.  Possibilities include:\n\n* **A figure hunched over even further, perhaps in a hoverchair or even just a floating torso, completely absorbed in a virtual reality headset or some other advanced technology implanted directly into their body.** This would emphasize the potential for technology to completely disconnect us from the physical world.\n* **A figure with atrophied limbs, highlighting the physical decline that could accompany a sedentary, technology-dependent lifestyle.**  This would be a more dystopian take on the trend.\n* **A figure represented only by a digital avatar or online profile, suggesting a complete merging with the digital realm.**  This would represent the ultimate loss of physical identity in favor of a digital one.\n\nThe overall point would be to satirize the potential negative consequences of over-reliance on technology, such as physical decline, social isolation, and a detachment from reality.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
