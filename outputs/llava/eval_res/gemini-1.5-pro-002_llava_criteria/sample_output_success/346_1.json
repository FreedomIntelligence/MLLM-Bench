    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCritique the ad's implication of female competence and its potential impact on stereotypes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a woman opening a bottle of ketchup, with the phrase \"you mean a woman can open it\" in white text, which implies that it is usually associated with men. This kind of stereotype perpetuates the notion that women are not as capable as men in tasks that involve physical strength and dexterity. This can have negative consequences on societal expectations and attitudes towards women, leading to a lack of opportunities, unequality, and limited perception of women's abilities. Such an advertisement may also promote the idea that women need to prove their competence in performing tasks that are typically considered \"manly\", reinforcing gender stereotypes and limiting the potential of women.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis ad plays on the harmful stereotype that women are incapable of performing simple tasks, particularly those that might require a bit of strength or mechanical aptitude.  The woman's exaggerated expression of surprise and the caption \"You mean a woman can open it?\" reinforce the idea that opening a ketchup bottle is somehow beyond a woman's abilities.\n\nThe impact of this type of messaging is that it perpetuates and normalizes the idea of female incompetence.  It contributes to a culture where women are seen as less capable than men, especially in practical matters.  This can have real-world consequences, impacting women's self-esteem, their opportunities, and how they are perceived in both professional and personal settings.  It reinforces the idea that certain tasks are \"men's work\" and others are \"women's work,\" limiting options for both genders.  While the ad may have been intended as humorous, it relies on a sexist trope that ultimately undermines women's competence.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response recognizes the ad's implied message about female competence.\n2. Assess the response's insight on the ad's reinforcement or challenge of gender stereotypes.\n3. Evaluate the response's consideration of the potential societal impact of such stereotypes.",
