    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe Daily Mail front page uses several emotive techniques to impact the reader:\n\n* **\"Evil\"**:  Branding the murderer \"evil\" is a strong moral judgment, immediately evoking disgust and condemnation in the reader.  It leaves no room for nuance or understanding of the perpetrator, framing him as purely monstrous.\n\n* **\"Heart-rending\"**: Describing the story as \"heart-rending\" appeals directly to the reader's empathy and emotions. It suggests a deeply tragic and moving narrative, encouraging readers to engage with the podcast out of sympathy for the victim.\n\n* **\"Award-winning podcast\"**: This adds credibility and prestige to the podcast, suggesting it's a high-quality production worthy of attention.  It subtly implies that listening is a worthwhile and even culturally valuable activity.\n\n* **\"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL\"**: This headline, related to a separate story about Home Secretary Suella Braverman, uses highly charged, aggressive language.  The capitalized text and repetitive structure create a sense of urgency and threat. It frames any criticism of Braverman as an attack on a larger group (\"us all\"), fostering a sense of tribalism and defensiveness among her supporters.  It also attempts to portray her as a strong figure standing up for a particular set of values.  This language is designed to rally support for Braverman and potentially intimidate her critics.\n\nThe combined impact of these emotive choices is to:\n\n* **Generate strong emotional reactions**:  From outrage at the murderer to sympathy for the victim and protectiveness towards Braverman.\n* **Drive engagement**: Encouraging readers to listen to the podcast and follow the political story.\n* **Frame narratives**:  Presenting a simplified, emotionally charged view of complex events.  This can influence readers' perceptions and opinions.\n* **Polarize audiences**: The strong language, particularly in the Braverman headline, is likely to reinforce existing political divisions.\n\nThe Daily Mail's use of emotive language is a deliberate strategy to capture attention and influence readers. While effective in generating engagement, it can also contribute to a more polarized and emotionally charged public discourse.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotive language in headlines and specify its emotional tone (e.g., \"evil\", \"heart-rending\").\n2. Explain how the chosen language could influence readers' emotions or perceptions.",
