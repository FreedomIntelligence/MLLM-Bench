    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe chart shows a clear upward trend in global mean temperature from the mid-1800s to 2023.  Key implications include:\n\n* **Global warming is real and significant:**  All the datasets presented (HadCRUT5, NOAAGlobalTemp, Kadow et al., GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, JRA-55, and ERA5) demonstrate a consistent warming trend.\n* **The warming has accelerated in recent decades:** The slope of the lines becomes steeper after the mid-20th century, indicating a faster rate of warming.\n* **The 1850-1900 average is a useful baseline:** The chart uses this period as a reference point, showing how much temperatures have deviated from what was considered \"normal\" in the pre-industrial era.\n* **Multiple datasets corroborate the findings:**  The use of several independent datasets strengthens the conclusion that the observed warming is a robust phenomenon, not an artifact of any single measurement method.\n* **The data is up-to-date:** The chart includes data through 2023, reflecting the most recent temperature measurements.\n* **The warming is approximately 1.3°C above the 1850-1900 average:**  By 2023, the global mean temperature has risen significantly.\n\nThe chart, created by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), provides strong evidence of a continuing and accelerating warming trend, a key indicator of climate change.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
