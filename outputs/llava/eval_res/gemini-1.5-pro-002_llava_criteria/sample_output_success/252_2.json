    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side closely to identify and compare the differences between them as much as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe only difference between the two images is the presence of horizontal stripes on the waving dog's shirt on the right-hand side. The left-hand image shows a plain shirt.  Everything else, including the poses, expressions, background details, and the other dog's appearance, is identical.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are two different representations of a puppy on a leash carrying a backpack. The two images can be distinguished by analyzing the expressions of the cute puppy. While the puppy is walking, it has a distinctive smile on its face, indicating that it is happy and enjoying the moment. In various locations throughout the images, you can also see the grass on the ground, adding to the visual context of the scene. The two different expressions of the puppy and the overall atmosphere in both pictures can be compared, highlighting the variations in their expressions and the overall scene they depict.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences: eye color, belt, shirt stripes, facial hair, eyebrow, socks, left dog's bag, left dog's eyelash, left dog's mouth wrinkle.\n2. Ensure all differences listed in the reference are mentioned accurately.\n3. Compare both images for any additional differences not listed in the reference.",
