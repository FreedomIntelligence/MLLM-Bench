    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues, estimate the approximate height of the woman.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman is likely approximately 5.5 feet tall or shorter, as she is described as a \"little woman\" and is standing below both the large man and the large person in a jacket. Her height is in contrast to the taller individuals present in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYao Ming, the man on the left, is officially listed at 7'6\" (2.29m).  Christina Aguilera's head reaches approximately his elbow.  Given his height, his elbow would likely be around 5' (1.52m) from the ground.  This suggests Christina Aguilera is somewhere in the range of **5'2\" - 5'4\" (1.57m - 1.63m)** tall, accounting for her heeled shoes and the fact that her head isn't perfectly level with his elbow.  Her listed height is 5'2\" (1.57m), which aligns with this visual estimation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes estimated height of woman using visual comparison with reference heights.\n2. Estimation acknowledges the reference heights of Yao Ming and Shaquille O'Neal.",
