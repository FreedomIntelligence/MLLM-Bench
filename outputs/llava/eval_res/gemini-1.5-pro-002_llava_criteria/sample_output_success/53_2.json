    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis is the Sydney Opera House, a masterpiece of **Expressionist architecture**.  Danish architect Jørn Utzon conceived its iconic design.\n\n* **Architectural Style:**  Expressionism, specifically late Modern Expressionism. It moves away from strict functionalism and embraces sculptural, organic forms.  The building's sail-like shells are a dramatic departure from traditional architectural shapes, prioritizing artistic expression and evoking emotional responses.\n\n* **Design Concept:** Utzon's design was inspired by several sources, including:\n    * **Nature:** The shells resemble the segments of an orange, or perhaps the billowing sails of ships on Sydney Harbour.  This connection to the natural world is a key element of Expressionism.\n    * **Pre-cast concrete technology:**  While the shapes appear complex, Utzon sought a modular system for construction.  He envisioned the shells as prefabricated concrete segments, though realizing this proved technically challenging.  The final solution involved complex geometric calculations and innovative construction techniques.\n    * **Swedish architecture:** Utzon admired the simplicity and functionality of Swedish design, which likely influenced the underlying principles of the Opera House, even as its outward appearance is far more expressive.\n    * **Maya architecture:** Some scholars have also noted similarities between the Opera House shells and certain Mayan temples, suggesting a possible, though less documented, influence.\n\nThe image itself shows a temporary projection of poppies onto the sails, likely commemorating Remembrance Day. This doesn't alter the underlying architectural style but demonstrates the building's capacity to serve as a canvas for artistic expression, further highlighting its Expressionist nature.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
