Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, summarize the abstract in one sentence and explain the significance of this article.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe abstract describes a paper that highlights the importance of democratizing chatbot development by incorporating multiple languages, including English and Chinese, to allow chatbots to communicate with users across diverse linguistic backgrounds. This can be achieved by using innovative models such as Phoenix, which can enhance the performance of chatbots while reducing the learning time required. The significance of this article lies in promoting the use of chatbots in various languages, thus providing universal access and fostering global connections.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis paper introduces \"Phoenix,\" a large language model designed to make ChatGPT-like capabilities accessible across various languages, especially those with limited resources.\n\nThe significance of this article lies in its potential to broaden access to powerful language models like ChatGPT, particularly in regions where usage is restricted due to OpenAI's policies or local government regulations, thereby promoting a more democratized and inclusive AI landscape.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Summarize the abstract in one sentence, mentioning 'Phoenix', 'democratize ChatGPT', and 'languages'.\n2. Explain the significance, focusing on accessibility in 'resource-limited' areas and 'non-Latin languages'.",
