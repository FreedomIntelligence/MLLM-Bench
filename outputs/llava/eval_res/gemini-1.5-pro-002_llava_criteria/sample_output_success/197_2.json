    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound appears to be a small, superficial burn or abrasion. The skin is pink and possibly blistered, indicating damage to the upper layers of skin.  There's no significant swelling or redness surrounding the immediate area, suggesting it's a relatively minor injury.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* **Keep it clean:** Gently wash the area with mild soap and water. Avoid scrubbing.\n* **Don't pop any blisters:**  Intact blisters provide a protective barrier against infection. If a blister breaks on its own, gently clean it and cover it with a clean bandage.\n* **Protect the wound:** Cover the area with a loose, clean bandage to prevent further irritation and infection.\n* **Moisturize:** Once the wound starts to heal, you can apply a fragrance-free moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated and prevent itching.\n* **Avoid irritants:**  Stay away from harsh chemicals, perfumes, and lotions that could irritate the wound.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relief:** If needed, you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief.\n* **Watch for signs of infection:**  If you notice increased pain, swelling, redness, pus, or fever, seek medical attention.\n\n**Important:** This advice is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice. If you are concerned about the wound or it doesn't seem to be healing properly, consult a doctor or other healthcare professional.  They can properly assess the injury and recommend the best course of treatment.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
