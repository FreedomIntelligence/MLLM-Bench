Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happened to each row of the image from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nEach row shows a progression of image resolution enhancement, moving from a very low-resolution, pixelated image on the left to a higher-resolution, clearer image on the right.  Essentially, the images are being upscaled and details are being added as you move from left to right.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFrom left to right, each row has one row with a man and the rest of the rows have women.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the progression of image quality from left to right in each row.\n2. Confirm the presence of human faces in varying resolutions and clarity in the image.\n3. Assess if the description includes changes in detail and recognizability.",
