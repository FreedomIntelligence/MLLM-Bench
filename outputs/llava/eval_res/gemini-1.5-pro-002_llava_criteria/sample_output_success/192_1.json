    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nCT Head without contrast\n\nFindings:\n\nLarge, heterogeneously enhancing right frontoparietal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect, causing rightward midline shift and compression of the right lateral ventricle. There is evidence of hemorrhage within the mass.  No skull fracture is identified.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n* **High-grade glioma:**  The heterogeneity, hemorrhage, and surrounding edema are highly suggestive.\n* **Metastasis:**  While less likely given the solitary nature and appearance, metastasis remains a possibility.\n* **Abscess:**  Less likely given the absence of a clear ring-enhancing pattern, though cannot be entirely excluded.\n* **Other primary brain tumors (e.g., lymphoma):** Less likely given the imaging characteristics.\n\n\nRecommendation:\n\nContrast-enhanced CT or MRI brain with and without contrast is recommended for further characterization of the lesion and to better delineate its extent. Neurosurgical consultation is advised.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This is an AI-generated interpretation based on the provided image. It is NOT a substitute for a formal radiological report by a qualified radiologist. Clinical correlation and further imaging are essential for definitive diagnosis and management.  The image quality is limited and affects the certainty of the interpretation.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
