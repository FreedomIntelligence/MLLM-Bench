    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is a table, and you need to implement data visualization based on the data in the table, in order to present the data in the table in the best way.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the image features a table with a list of different states in India, one potential data visualization approach is to create a bar chart or a line graph that displays the population of each state over time. This can help showcase changes in population growth and trends across the states, and highlight any particularly fast-growing or slow-growing areas.\n\nTo implement this approach, you can use a data visualization tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a specialized data visualization application. Start by sorting the table by the population column or selecting the columns that show the population figures for each state. Then, create a bar chart or a line graph with the population data on the vertical axis and the state names on the horizontal axis.\n\nFurthermore, you can consider adding color-coding to the chart based on the state's region, such as North, South, East, or West, to make it easier to identify trends within specific geographic areas. Finally, you can add labels and legends to the chart for better clarity and understanding of the data. With these visualization techniques, you can effectively present the data in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nA stacked area chart would be an excellent way to visualize this data.  Here's why and how:\n\n**Why a Stacked Area Chart?**\n\n* **Shows change over time:** The data represents percentage share over different time periods (Finance Commissions), making a time-series visualization appropriate.\n* **Comparison across categories:** You can easily compare the changing share of each state over time.\n* **Overall trend:** The total area of the chart represents the total allocation, and you can see how this changes over the different periods.\n* **Individual contribution:** The area for each state within the stack shows its relative contribution to the total in each period.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\n1. **X-axis:**  Finance Commission periods (Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, etc.)\n2. **Y-axis:** Percentage share of Union Taxes and Duties.\n3. **Stacked Areas:** Each state gets its own colored area within the stack.  Use distinct colors for easy differentiation.\n4. **Legend:** Clearly label each state's color in a legend.\n5. **Title:** A descriptive title like \"% Share of Union Taxes and Duties Allocated to States over Time\" would be appropriate.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Ordering of states:** Arrange the states in the stack from largest to smallest average share (or some other meaningful order) for better readability.\n* **Interactive elements:** If possible, make the chart interactive so users can hover over areas to see the exact percentage for a specific state in a given period.\n* **Highlighting key states:** If you want to focus on specific states, you could use bolder colors or callouts for those areas.\n* **Simplifying the chart:** If the chart becomes too cluttered with all states, you could group smaller states into an \"Other\" category or create separate charts for different regions of India.\n\nBy using a stacked area chart and incorporating these considerations, you can effectively present the data in a visually appealing and insightful manner.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Visualize data trends across Finance Commissions for multiple states.\n2. Highlight top three states with the highest percentage share changes.\n3. Ensure visualization clarity for comparison between states and years.",
