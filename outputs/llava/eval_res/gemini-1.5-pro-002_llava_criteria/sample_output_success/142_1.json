    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain how the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit could be perceived as humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses and a hat, to a pineapple can be perceived as humorous because it gives the fruit a quirky and amusing appearance. This unconventional combination of a fruit and human-like accessories can be seen as a playful statement and may evoke laughter or amusement in viewers. The image of the pineapple with sunglasses lying on a bed on a blanket adds to the lighthearted and comical nature of the scene, as it is an atypical, whimsical depiction of a commonly seen object.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in adding human-like accessories, like sunglasses, to a pineapple comes from the incongruity.  We don't expect inanimate objects, especially food, to wear sunglasses. This unexpected juxtaposition creates a sense of absurdity.  \n\nSpecifically:\n\n* **Anthropomorphism:**  Giving human qualities to non-human things is inherently funny. We're projecting our own experiences and behaviours onto something that can't possibly have them. The sunglasses create a persona, suggesting the pineapple is cool, relaxed, or even trying to hide its identity.\n* **The contrast:** The rough, textured pineapple paired with sleek, modern sunglasses creates a visual clash that's amusing.  The pineapple is a natural object, the sunglasses are artificial and fashionable.\n* **The implication of intention:** The placement of the sunglasses suggests someone deliberately put them there. This implies the pineapple is *choosing* to wear them, further adding to the anthropomorphic humor.\n* **Situational context:**  The pineapple is resting on a pillow, further enhancing the anthropomorphic effect.  It looks like it's relaxing or about to go to sleep, adding another layer of absurdity.\n\nEssentially, the humor stems from the unexpected and illogical scenario of a pineapple wearing sunglasses, creating a lighthearted and playful image.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the accessory (sunglasses) and its typical human use.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing fruit by accessorizing.\n3. Discuss the incongruity between the pineapple and sunglasses.",
