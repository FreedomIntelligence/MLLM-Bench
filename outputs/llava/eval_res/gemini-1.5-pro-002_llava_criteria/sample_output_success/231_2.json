Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capital among the countries listed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe data suggests a positive correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **US (High GDP per capita):**  The US has a high average night light value per pixel (4.66).  A significant portion of the country (almost 80%) falls within higher night light intensity ranges (3-62).  This aligns with a developed economy with widespread electricity access and economic activity.\n\n* **Brazil (Medium GDP per capita):** Brazil shows a lower average night light value (0.63) compared to the US.  A large portion of the country has very low or no night light intensity (94.02% at 0).  While Brazil has some areas with higher intensities, they are less prevalent than in the US, reflecting its lower, but still developing, economic status.\n\n* **Madagascar (Low GDP per capita):** Madagascar has the lowest average night light value (0.02) and an overwhelming majority (99.73%) of the country falls into the zero intensity category. This is consistent with a less developed economy with limited electricity access and lower economic output.\n\n**In summary:** Higher GDP per capita correlates with higher average night light intensity and a greater proportion of the country exhibiting higher light intensity values.  Conversely, lower GDP per capita corresponds with lower average night light intensity and a larger percentage of the country having little to no detectable night light.  This relationship likely reflects the connection between economic activity, electricity consumption, and development.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo analyze the correlation between night light intensity and GDP per capita among the countries listed, one can refer to the image showing a scatter plot of these two variables. The x-axis represents the night light intensity, whereas the y-axis represents the GDP per capita. By observing the plot, one can determine the strength and direction of the relationship between these two factors. A positive correlation indicates that countries with higher night light intensity tend to have higher GDP per capita, while a negative correlation suggests the opposite. Additionally, if there is a significant linear relationship, it can provide insights into how night light intensity influences GDP per capita among these countries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Relate the night light intensity to average value per pixel.\n2. There is a positive relationship between average value per pixel (night light intensity) and GDP per capital.",
