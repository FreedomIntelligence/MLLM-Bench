    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the human movement and environment in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image captures a mountain biker in a dramatic, high-stakes descent down a rugged canyon ridge. \n\n**Human Movement:** The biker is leaning forward, body positioned aggressively over the handlebars, indicating speed and control.  His gaze is directed downwards, focused on the treacherous path ahead. He's wearing a full-face helmet with goggles, a black tank top, orange riding shorts, and gloves. His hands grip the handlebars firmly, and his feet are positioned on the pedals, actively working. The biker is kicking up a cloud of dust behind him, suggesting a fast and dynamic movement across the loose terrain.\n\n**Environment:** The environment is a harsh, arid canyon landscape.  The rider navigates a narrow, exposed ridge line composed of light brown and tan rock and dirt. The path is uneven and rocky, with a steep drop-off on the right side, emphasized by the fisheye lens. This drop-off reveals the layered, eroded rock formations of the canyon, showcasing a mix of bare rock and sparse vegetation clinging to the cliffs.  The left side of the path is somewhat less steep but still precarious, lined with what appear to be sandbags for erosion control or possibly course markers. The sky is a clear, vibrant blue, and the bright sunlight casts strong shadows, enhancing the depth and texture of the scene. A Red Bull Rampage logo is visible on the canyon wall, indicating the context of the image as an extreme sporting event. In the distance, at the top of the ridge, some construction equipment and flags are visible, likely related to the event setup. The overall impression is one of extreme terrain, requiring exceptional skill and bravery from the biker.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is skillfully riding a bicycle down a rocky, dirt hillside. The cyclist is in motion, traveling on a narrow path between large rocks and boulders. The surrounding environment appears to be a mixture of mountainous terrain and a rocky cliff. The rider displays impressive balance and control as they navigate through the challenging landscape. This captivating scene showcases the adventurous aspect of mountain biking and the rider's ability to adapt to unpredictable, rocky terrain.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the cyclist's action and position in the air.\n2. Detail the mountainous and rocky environment surrounding the cyclist.\n3. Mention the lighting and weather conditions visible in the image.",
