    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the building in the picture? To which period can its construction be traced back to?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe building in the picture is the **Great Wall of China**.\n\nIts construction spans many centuries, but the most extensive and well-preserved sections were built during the **Ming dynasty (1368-1644)**.  Earlier walls and fortifications date back to the 7th century BC, though these were made of rammed earth and other less durable materials.  The Ming dynasty undertook a massive project to rebuild and strengthen the wall with brick and stone, creating the iconic structure we see today.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe building in the picture is an ancient, large, and historic structure, likely a castle or a fortress. Its construction can be traced back to the Xi'an period in China, which dates back to around the 11th century. It has a unique design, featuring a high stone wall lining its side and a distinctive stepped appearance. The steepness of the wall and its impressive height make it a fascinating sight and a testament to the architectural and engineering prowess of the time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
