    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the intensity of the emotion on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and justify the assessment based on visual cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe intensity of the emotion on this angry face can be assessed as severe. The visual cues indicating this level of intensity include the character's wide-opened eyes, furrowed brow, and tightly clenched teeth as they make a face of anger and frustration. The red color of the character's face also contributes to the intensity of the expression, as red is often associated with strong emotions or danger. Overall, these visual cues give the impression of a highly intense and severe emotional state.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nI would assess Anger's emotion as **severe**.  This is justified by several visual cues:\n\n* **Bright red color:**  Red is universally associated with anger and the vibrant, almost glowing shade intensifies the portrayal of the emotion.\n* **Furrowed brows:**  The deep lines above the eyes indicate a high level of tension and displeasure.\n* **Wide, staring eyes:** The eyes are wide open with a fixed, intense gaze, suggesting a high level of arousal and focus on the source of anger.\n* **Bared teeth and clenched jaw:** This is a classic expression of intense anger, indicating a readiness for aggression.\n* **Clenched fists:**  The tightly closed fists further emphasize the physical tension and potential for aggressive outburst associated with severe anger.\n\nAll these cues combine to create a picture of someone experiencing not just annoyance or frustration, but overwhelming, potent anger.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the identified emotion matches the character's facial expression (e.g., angry, frustrated).\n2. Rate the intensity of the emotion as moderate, or severe.",
