    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat famous festivals or cultural events are often held around the landmark in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe landmark is Mount Fuji, and numerous festivals and events are held in the surrounding area.  Some notable examples connected to the mountain and its nearby lakes and towns include:\n\n* **Fujiyoshida Fire Festival:** Held in late August in Fujiyoshida City, this festival features enormous torches lining the streets to celebrate the end of Mount Fuji's climbing season.\n\n* **Yamanakako Hanabi Taikai (Lake Yamanaka Fireworks Festival):**  One of the largest fireworks displays in Japan, held on Lake Yamanaka during the summer.

Events include illuminated autumn leaves and other festivities.\n\n* **Shibazakura Festival:** Held near Fuji Five Lakes (including Lake Motosuko), this festival showcases stunning fields of pink moss phlox (shibazakura) with Mount Fuji as a backdrop.\n\nIt's important to note that many smaller local festivals and events also take place in the towns and villages surrounding Mount Fuji, often celebrating the mountain, the seasons, or local traditions.
