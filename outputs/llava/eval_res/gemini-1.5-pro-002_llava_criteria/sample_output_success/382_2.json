    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the dancer's landing technique, and suggest the next movements that would follow.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe dancer appears to be landing from a small jump or leap, leading with her right foot in a pointed position, typical of ballet or contemporary dance. Her arms are outstretched, suggesting a balance element to the movement.  She's wearing pointe shoes, further indicating a ballet influence.  Given her slightly forward momentum and the angle of her body, she's likely to land softly on the ball of her right foot, rolling through to a flat foot, while maintaining a controlled descent.\n\nPossible next movements:\n\n* **A développé à la seconde:**  Extending her left leg to the side, maintaining balance and control. This would flow naturally from the current pose and emphasize the line created by her extended arms.\n* **A chassé forward:**  A gliding step forward with the left foot, transferring weight smoothly and continuing the momentum of the landing. This could be the start of a traveling sequence.\n* **A simple relevé:** Rising onto the balls of both feet, maintaining the elegant posture and creating a sense of lightness. This could transition into further jumps or turns.\n* **A slow, controlled descent to a crouched position:**  Bringing her arms in towards her body, creating a sense of grounding and completion of the movement.  This could be followed by a contraction and release or other floor work.\n* **A turn, such as a soutenu or piqué turn:** Using the momentum of the landing to initiate a graceful rotation.\n\n\nThe specific next movement would depend on the overall choreography and the dancer's artistic intention.  The landing itself sets up a variety of possibilities for continuing the flow and expression of the dance.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the woman in the blue dress appears to be in the middle of a ballet move, with her arms and legs extended. As she appears to be dancing on the pavement in front of a building, she might be performing an outdoor dance or show. Since she seems to be in mid-air, it is likely that she will be performing a controlled landing, which involves bending her knees slightly to absorb the impact of her feet touching the pavement. Once she lands, she might continue her dance, possibly following a specific choreography or improvising her movements. The next movements could include graceful footwork, turns, or even more aerial maneuvers, depending on the style and complexity of the dance being performed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately predict the dancer's landing technique based on body posture and movement direction.\n2. Suggest plausible next dance movements that could logically follow from the landing position.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects a coherent understanding of dance motion and sequence.",
