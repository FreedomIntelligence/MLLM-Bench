    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict which watch characteristics will dominate in the next decade.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, which features a timeline of various tuna types, it is difficult to predict which watch characteristics will dominate the next decade. However, since the timeline represents different types of tuna and their developments, it is more likely to focus on the evolution of tuna species or their attributes, such as size, taste, and health benefits. Therefore, the expected trend would be to promote healthier and more sustainably sourced tuna options rather than focusing on watch features or characteristics that do not relate to the primary subject of the timeline.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the Seiko Tuna timeline and current watch trends, here's a prediction of characteristics that will likely dominate in the next decade:\n\n* **Advanced Materials:**  Expect continued exploration of materials like ceramic, titanium, and high-strength steel alloys for cases and bezels.  Focus will be on durability, lightness, and scratch resistance.  Possibly even new materials we haven't seen widely used yet.\n* **Enhanced Movements:** Spring Drive and Kinetic movements will likely see further refinement and potentially new hybrid technologies.  Accuracy, power reserve, and shock resistance will be key areas of improvement.  Solar charging could also become more prevalent.\n* **Connectivity and Smart Features:** While the Tuna has traditionally been a purely mechanical/quartz dive watch, the next decade may see the integration of some smart features, perhaps focusing on dive logging, GPS, or other functions relevant to diving and outdoor activities.  This will likely be a balancing act, preserving the Tuna's tool watch essence.\n* **Sustainability:** Watch brands are increasingly focusing on sustainable practices.  Expect to see recycled materials, eco-friendly packaging, and potentially even solar-powered options in future Tuna models.\n* **Retro-inspired Design with Modern Tweaks:** The Tuna's iconic case shape is likely to remain, but we might see variations in bezel designs, dial textures, and hand styles.  Reissues and homages to past models will continue, but with updated materials and movements.\n* **Focus on Functionality:**  The Tuna's core strength is its robust functionality as a dive watch.  Future models will likely double down on this, potentially with improved water resistance, lume, and other dive-specific features.\n* **Customization Options:**  Brands are increasingly offering personalization options.  We might see more options for straps, bezels, and dial colors, allowing owners to tailor their Tuna to their individual preferences.\n* **Increased Price Point:**  With the use of advanced materials, movements, and potentially smart features, the price of Tuna models is likely to continue rising.\n\nIt's important to note that these are predictions, and the watch market is constantly evolving.  Unforeseen technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences could significantly impact the direction of watch design in the coming years.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify historical trends in watch features from the timeline.\n2. Predict future trends in materials, technology, or design elements.\n3. Answer must be plausible and reflect evolution from past to future.",
