    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer from the image the occupation of the group of individuals.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe individuals are students working on a science project. They are using globes and a light source, likely to study the Earth-Sun-Moon system as suggested by the \"Essential Question\" written on the whiteboard.  The setting is a classroom.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the group of individuals appears to be students, as they are engaged in a science project involving experiments with light bulbs and globes. They are likely working together in a science classroom or a laboratory setting, which is a typical environment for students participating in educational activities and projects. The presence of multiple individuals working on the experiment suggests that they are collaborating on a shared goal or task, commonly associated with educational or research-oriented groups.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer aligns with the reference occupation: Students.\n2. Justify the occupation inference based on elements in the image, such as textbooks, the globe, the bulb simulating the sun.",
