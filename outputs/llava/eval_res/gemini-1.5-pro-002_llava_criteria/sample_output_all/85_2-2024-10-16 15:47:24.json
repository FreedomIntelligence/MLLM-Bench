    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the color, shape and other attribute you think would be useful for people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis plant appears to be a Hosta, likely a variety with variegated leaves.  Here's how to recognize it:\n\n* **Color:** The leaves are primarily a vibrant, light yellow or chartreuse, with distinct streaks and sections of deep green. This contrasting variegation is a key identifier.\n* **Shape:** The leaves are broadly ovate (egg-shaped) with pointed tips. They are slightly cupped or folded inwards, giving the plant a compact, mounded appearance.  The veins are prominent and run parallel from the base to the tip of the leaf.\n* **Other attributes:**\n    * **Texture:** Hosta leaves generally have a smooth, slightly waxy feel.\n    * **Growth Habit:** They grow in clumps or mounds, with leaves emerging from a central base. They don't typically grow very tall.\n    * **Location/Environment:** Hostas are shade-loving plants, often found in gardens or wooded areas.  They prefer moist, well-drained soil.\n    * **Seasonal Changes:**  Hostas are perennials. They die back to the ground in winter and re-emerge in spring.  They may also produce flower stalks with small, bell-shaped flowers in summer, depending on the variety.\n\n\nThe bright yellow and green variegation, combined with the ovate leaf shape and mounding habit, makes this particular Hosta relatively easy to distinguish from other garden plants.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a beautiful, multicolored plant with vibrant green and yellow leaves. The plant exhibits an interesting and colorful flower pattern, making it a striking and attractive feature in the garden. The plant's bright leaves and blooms create an eye-catching and lively effect, adding a unique touch of natural beauty to the garden.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the plant as Hosta.\n 2. Describe the shape, color, and arrangement of the plant's leaves.\n3. Mention any additional attributes that aid recognition (e.g., environment, leaf pattern).",
