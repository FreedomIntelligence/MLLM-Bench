    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the red berry in the smoothie bowl in the image? How is it different from the dark purple berry in the bowl? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe red berry in the smoothie bowl is the strawberry, whereas the dark purple berry is the acai berry. Both of these berries are included in the smoothie alongside other fruits, such as blueberries, blackberries, and bananas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe red berries in the smoothie bowl are raspberries. The dark purple berries are blackberries.\n\nRaspberries and blackberries are both aggregate fruits meaning they are made up of many small individual fruits clustered together. However, raspberries are hollow on the inside when picked, leaving a visible core, while blackberries retain a white, fleshy core.  Raspberries also tend to be smaller and more delicate than blackberries, and they have a slightly tarter flavor. Blackberries are larger, firmer, and have a sweeter, slightly earthier taste than raspberries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the raspberry and describe its color, shape, and texture\n2. Identify the dark purple berry as blackberry.\n3. Include at least one distinctive feature that differentiates the raspberry from the dark purple berry.",
