    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf one of the person in the image wants to post this picture on social media, please help write an small article which narrates the entire scene from his/her perspective and include their sensory experiences - what they see, hear, smell, and feel - as well as their inner thoughts and emotions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe sand, still warm from the day's sun, cradles my bare feet. A gentle breeze whispers through my hair, carrying the salty tang of the ocean.  The rhythmic hush of the waves, rolling in and out, is a soothing soundtrack to this perfect moment.  I reach out, squeezing my husband’s hand a little tighter, and glance down at our little one, his tiny hand clasped in mine. He’s mesmerized by the spectacle unfolding before us, just as I am.\n\nThe sky is a canvas painted with vibrant hues of orange, pink, and gold, as the sun dips below the horizon.  It's a breathtaking panorama, a masterpiece of nature that takes my breath away every single time. I can hear the soft murmurs of appreciation from my family around me, a chorus of \"wows\" and contented sighs.  The air is alive with the energy of shared wonder, a palpable connection that hums between us all.\n\nThis is what it’s all about.  This feeling of belonging, of being surrounded by the people I love most in the world, bathed in the golden glow of a setting sun.  No filters needed, just pure, unadulterated joy.  I close my eyes for a moment, imprinting this scene in my memory, a treasured keepsake to carry with me always.  \n\nThis photo, this moment, captures the essence of our family.  A testament to love, laughter, and the simple beauty of being together. #Family #Sunset #BeachLife #Blessed #MakingMemories #NoFilterNeeded\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAs I stand on the beach with my family and friends, our hands entwined in a chain, I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and happiness. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the waves, and the sky is adorned with clouds that add to the picturesque scene. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the gentle sea breeze create a calming atmosphere. The smell of the saltwater and the cool sand beneath my feet remind me of the carefree days of childhood spent on the beach.\n\nAs I look at the people around me - our family and friends, young and old, I feel a sense of togetherness and gratitude. This moment captured, with the backdrop of a beautiful sunset, is a memory that will be cherished for years to come. It is a reminder of the importance of spending quality time with loved ones, enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\n\nWith my cellphone in hand, I snap a photo to capture this precious memory. The image not only shows the chain of people on the beach but also the vibrant colors of the sunset and the ocean waves. I share it on social media, along with a caption that expresses my emotions and thoughts about this beautiful moment. The picture spreads joy, and many people like and share it, highlighting the significance of such moments in our lives.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
