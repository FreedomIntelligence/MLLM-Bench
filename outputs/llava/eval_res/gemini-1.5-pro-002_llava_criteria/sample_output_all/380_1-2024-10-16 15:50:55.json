    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the player's current motion and positioning relative to the soccer ball to predict the success of the save, and the consequent positioning of players following the save attempt.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe goalkeeper has stretched his arms out to catch the soccer ball and seems to be in a good position to save it. The ball is still in the air, and the goalkeeper is focused on stopping it. Based on the position of the players on the field, there are a total of 10 outfield players and 3 goalkeepers from both teams.\n\nFollowing the save, the goalkeeper will likely throw the ball back towards the other end of the field, and the outfield players will reposition themselves to recover possession or defend against the opposing team's next attack. The player who shot the ball (number 10) will likely try to move towards the goal area or the center of the field to create a scoring opportunity for his team. Players from both teams are likely to adjust their positions to maintain a defensive or attacking stance, depending on their teammates' actions, the ball's direction, and the momentary game situation regarding possession and scoring opportunities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe goalkeeper is fully extended, reaching high and slightly to his right. The ball is very close to the goal line and just entering the plane of the goal.  Given the goalkeeper's momentum and the ball's trajectory, the save is likely to be successful. The goalkeeper will probably tip the ball over the crossbar or possibly to the side for a corner kick.\n\n**Consequent Positioning:**\n\n* **Goalkeeper:** After the save, the goalkeeper will likely land inside the goal and quickly reposition himself on the goal line, anticipating a corner kick or another immediate attack.\n* **Defender #10 (Red):** He is close to the goal line and will likely remain there to clear the ball if the save results in a rebound.\n* **Defender #5 (White):** He seems to be tracking back towards the goal and will likely continue this movement to provide defensive support.\n* **Attacker #9 (Red):**  He is positioned near the far post and might try to get to the ball if it rebounds off the goalkeeper or the crossbar.\n* **Referee (Green):** Will be observing the play closely to make the correct call (corner kick, goal kick, etc.) and signal accordingly.\n* **Other Players (Red #3):** They are further away from the immediate action and will react based on the outcome of the save. They will likely move forward if the ball is cleared by the defense, or retreat if the attacking team retains possession.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess goalkeeper's motion and likelihood of reaching the ball for a save.\n2. Predict the ball's trajectory post-save and players' subsequent positions.\n3. Evaluate the positioning and potential actions of nearby outfield players.",
