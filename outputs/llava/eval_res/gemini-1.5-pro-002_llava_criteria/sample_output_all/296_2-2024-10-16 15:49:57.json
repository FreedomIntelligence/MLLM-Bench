    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in this picture is the area already occupied by the desk, chair, and hutch.\n\nRationale:\n\n* **Existing furniture:** The desk, chair, and hutch already provide the basic necessities for an office. This minimizes the need to rearrange or bring in new furniture.\n* **Lighting:** The desk is positioned near a window, providing natural light, which is beneficial for productivity and mood.  There's also a desk lamp for tasks requiring more focused light.\n* **Storage:** The hutch offers storage space for books, supplies, and other office essentials. The dresser could also be utilized for additional storage.\n* **Separation from sleeping area:**  While the room appears to be a bedroom, the desk area is visually and somewhat spatially separated from the bed, allowing for a distinction between work and rest.\n\nWhile the room isn't ideal as a dedicated office, within the given space, the existing desk area is the most logical and practical choice.  It offers the best combination of functionality and existing resources.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
