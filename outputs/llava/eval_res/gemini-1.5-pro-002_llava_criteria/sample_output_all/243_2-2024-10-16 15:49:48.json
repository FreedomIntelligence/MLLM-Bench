    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the visual design elements of the monsters, such as texture, coloration, and body structure.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGodzilla and Kong exhibit stark contrasts in their visual design.\n\n* **Texture:** Godzilla's skin resembles reptilian scales, thick and rough, like hardened rock or bark.  His dorsal fins are jagged and pointed. Kong's fur is thick and matted, giving him a more mammalian, almost shaggy appearance.  His skin, where visible, appears leathery and tough.\n\n* **Coloration:** Godzilla is predominantly dark greenish-brown, with hints of gold or bronze in his scales. This earthy palette helps him blend with natural environments. Kong is a much darker brown, almost black in some areas, which contrasts with the lighter fur on his chest and face.\n\n* **Body Structure:** Godzilla's build is reptilian, with a thick, powerful tail, a robust torso, and strong, digitigrade legs. His dorsal fins run down his back to the tip of his tail. Kong has a more primate-like structure, with long arms built for climbing and knuckle-walking, a broad chest, and powerful legs. His posture is more upright than Godzilla's.  While both are massive, Godzilla appears more elongated and horizontal, while Kong is more compact and vertical.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, both monsters have a menacing appearance, with a combination of rough texture and bold colors. They are closely facing each other, emphasizing the visual impact of their respective features. The first monster, located on the left, has a large, spiky, and clawed body structure, with a dark, almost gray-blue hue. On the other hand, the second monster is more towards the right and has a noticeably different appearance. This monster has a more prominent spiky head and is colored a mix of dark gray, black, and a few orange or red tones, giving it a more intimidating appearance. Although the two monsters have different body structures and colors, their overall visual design elements contribute to the action and intensity of the scene, making it an exciting and eye-catching image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare textures of Godzilla and King Kong.\n2. Describe and contrast the coloration of both monsters.\n3. Compare the body structures, focusing on distinguishing features.",
