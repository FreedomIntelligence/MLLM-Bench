    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the image in detail. Which bible verse perfectly describes this picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man standing in a grassy field with a giant book under his feet. There are also two smaller books in the scene. The man appears to be reading the book and may be surprised by its massive size. The image seems to be a creative and surreal depiction, with the man potentially engaged in some kind of fantastical or imaginative scenario.\n\nA fitting bible verse to describe this picture would be Psalm 40:4: \"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding.\" This verse emphasizes the value of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and could be interpreted as a reminder of the importance of reading and learning throughout life. In the context of the image, the man's engagement with the giant book may symbolize a pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, as well as an appreciation for the power of literature and imagination.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a serene landscape with a vast, grassy field stretching towards a bright, partly cloudy sky. A winding path, seemingly made of the pages of a giant open book, meanders through the field. An elderly man stands on the path, bent over, appearing to study the words on the book-path. A small wooden signpost near the bottom left corner points towards the book-path with the inscription \"RIGHT PATH.\"  In the far distance, tiny figures can be seen cycling or walking, suggesting other journeys. The overall impression is one of guidance, wisdom, and the importance of following the right path in life, symbolized by the book.\n\n\nSeveral Bible verses could be associated with this image, but **Psalm 119:105** is particularly fitting: \"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.\" This verse directly connects the word of God (often represented by the Bible) to guidance and direction in life, mirroring the image's depiction of the book as a path.  The man studying the path reinforces the idea of seeking guidance from scripture.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the man, open book path, sign \"RIGHT PATH\", and relate to Psalm 119:105.\n2. Explain how the image metaphorically represents the given bible verse.",
