    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nI've noticed a few stylishly fixable holes in my pants. Could you please advise me on the tools and materials required for repairing them in a fashionable manner?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThose holes look perfect for some visible mending! Here's what you'll need to repair them stylishly:\n\n**Tools:**\n\n* **Sharp Scissors:**  You already have these handy!  Essential for trimming loose threads and cutting patches.\n* **Embroidery Needles:**  Choose a variety of sizes to accommodate different thread weights and patching techniques.\n* **Embroidery Hoop (Optional but Recommended):**  This will keep the fabric taut while you work, making stitching neater and easier.\n\n**Materials:**\n\n* **Patching Fabric:**  Get creative!  Consider contrasting colours or patterns for a bold look.  You could use:\n    * **Scraps of fabric:** From old clothes, quilting squares, or even patterned bandanas.\n    * **Lace or other decorative fabrics:**  Add a touch of elegance.\n    * **Felt:**  Easy to work with and comes in a wide range of colours.\n* **Embroidery Thread:** Choose colours that complement your patching fabric and the original garment.  You can also use thicker threads like sashiko thread for a more textured look.\n* **Iron-on Interfacing (Optional):**  This can help stabilize the patch and prevent fraying, especially if using delicate fabrics.\n\n\n**Fashionable Mending Techniques:**\n\n* **Visible Darning/Sashiko:**  Use running stitches in a contrasting colour to reinforce the hole and create a decorative pattern. Sashiko thread is ideal for this.\n* **Embroidered Patches:**  Cut out patches slightly larger than the holes and stitch them on using decorative embroidery stitches like blanket stitch, chain stitch, or running stitch.\n* **Appliqué:**  Similar to embroidered patches, but you can create more intricate designs by layering different fabrics and stitching them down with a variety of stitches.\n* **Reverse Appliqué:**  This involves layering fabric underneath the hole, cutting out a shape around the hole from the top layer, and then stitching the edges of the top layer to the bottom layer to reveal the contrasting fabric underneath.\n* **Lace Inserts:**  Place a piece of lace slightly larger than the hole underneath the fabric and stitch it in place using a small, neat stitch.\n\n**Tips for a Stylish Finish:**\n\n* **Embrace Imperfection:** Visible mending is all about celebrating the repair, so don't worry about making it perfect.\n* **Consider Placement:**  Think about where the holes are located and how your chosen mending technique will impact the overall look of the garment.\n* **Experiment with Colour and Texture:**  Don't be afraid to mix and match different fabrics and threads to create a unique and personalized look.\n* **Practice on a Scrap:**  Before you start mending your pants, try out your chosen technique on a scrap of similar fabric to get a feel for it.\n\n\nHave fun with it and enjoy giving your pants a new lease of life!\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo repair the holes in your pants in a fashionable manner, you will need the following tools and materials:\n\n1.
