    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image appears to depict a person of importance (presumably a leader or official) in a central position, flanked by two attendants.  Let's break down their expressions and body language:\n\n* **Central Figure:**  This individual is seated, wearing more elaborate attire, and positioned in what looks like a ceremonial chair beneath symbolic imagery (sun, moon, possibly animal figures). Their facial expression is a clear smile, suggesting confidence, contentment, and perhaps pride.  The relaxed posture further reinforces this impression of ease and authority.  The placement and attire indicate higher status within the group.\n\n* **Flanking Figures (Attendants):** Both individuals are standing, wearing similar but less ornate clothing than the central figure.  They appear to be in a supportive or assisting role.\n\n    * **Figure on the Left:**  This person has a slight, polite smile, which could be interpreted as respectful or deferential. Their hands are placed together in front, which can be a gesture of composure or formality.  The overall impression is one of respectful attentiveness.\n\n    * **Figure on the Right:** This person also has a small, closed-mouth smile, similar to the figure on the left. Their hands are at their sides, a neutral and relaxed posture. Their expression is perhaps slightly less engaged than the figure on the left, but still conveys a sense of respectful presence.\n\n**Context and Speculation:** The setting, clothing, and symbolic imagery suggest a cultural or ceremonial context.  The central figure's attire and positioning strongly indicate a leadership role.  The flanking figures likely serve as attendants, assistants, or perhaps representatives of lower rank within the same group or organization.  The overall mood appears positive and formal.\n\nIt is important to note that these are interpretations based on visual cues.  Without more information about the specific cultural context, the precise meaning of the expressions and gestures cannot be definitively determined.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
