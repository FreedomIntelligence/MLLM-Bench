    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat would be the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image? The image size is 1300*1300\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe strawberry, including its green leaves, roughly occupies the area within these bounding box coordinates:\n\n**xmin:** 320\n**ymin:** 10\n**xmax:** 580\n**ymax:** 310\n\n\nThese coordinates are approximate, as the edges of the strawberry and leaves are somewhat soft.  They represent a box that comfortably contains the entire strawberry.  They are also relative to the provided 1300x1300 image dimensions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n[0.41, 0.05, 0.76, 0.28]\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of the strawberry's bounding box coordinates.\n2. Bounding box should tightly enclose the entire strawberry.\n3. Coordinates must be accurate relative to the image's dimensions.",
