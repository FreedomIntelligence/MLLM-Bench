    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat ingredients should I prepare to make a dish like this?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis looks like Hosomaki (thin rolls) with a few different fillings. To make these, you'll need:\n\n* **Sushi Rice:** Short-grain Japanese rice, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.\n* **Nori:** Dried seaweed sheets.\n* **Fillings:** Based on the image, you'll need:\n    * **Tuna:**  Likely raw, sushi-grade tuna.\n    * **Imitation Crab (Surimi) and Avocado:** A common combination.\n    * **Cucumber:** Thinly sliced.\n    * **Pickled Yellow Radish (Takuan):**  This provides a sweet and tangy flavor.\n* **Optional Garnishes:**\n    * **Gari (Pickled Ginger):**  Seen in the corner of the dish.\n    * **Wasabi:**  Japanese horseradish (not pictured, but often served with sushi).\n    * **Soy Sauce:** For dipping (not pictured).\n    * **Green Decorative Grass:**  Purely for presentation.\n\n\n**Equipment:**\n\n* **Bamboo rolling mat (Makisu):** Essential for rolling the sushi.\n* **Sharp knife:**  For clean cuts.\n* **Rice cooker (optional but recommended):** Makes perfect sushi rice.\n\n\nIf you're a beginner, it's a good idea to start with just one or two fillings. Cucumber and avocado are good choices for beginners as they are easy to work with.  Make sure to buy sushi-grade fish if you plan to use raw fish.  Enjoy!\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo make a sushi wrap dish similar to the one in the image, you will need the following ingredients:\n\n1. Sushi Rice: A blend of Japanese rice and rice vinegar, which provides the stickiness needed to hold the sushi together.\n\n2. Nori: Thin sheets of dried seaweed, usually made from kelp or other species of red or green algae. These are used to wrap the sushi roll.\n\n3. Sushi-grade fish: Choose fish that are suitable for sushi, such as salmon, tuna, or shrimp.\n\n4. Vegetables: Sliced cucumbers, avocado, and carrots are commonly used in sushi rolls.\n\n5. Sushi-making tools: A sushi mat, bamboo sushi roller, and a sharp knife will help you shape and assemble the rolls.\n\n6. Optional fillings: Other ingredients like imitation crab meat, sliced jalapeños, or pickled radishes can be added to enhance the flavor and crunch of the sushi roll.\n\n7. Soy sauce and pickled ginger: These condiments are often served on the side to complement the sushi rolls.\n\nBy combining these ingredients and using the appropriate tools and techniques, you will be able to create a delicious and visually appealing sushi wrap dish similar to the one seen in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List main ingredients visible: rice, seaweed, fish, vegetables (cucumber).\n2. Include common sushi ingredients not visible: sushi vinegar, sugar, salt.\n3.
