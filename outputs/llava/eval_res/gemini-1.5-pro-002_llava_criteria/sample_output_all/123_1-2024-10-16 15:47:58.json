    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the emotional significance of the embrace between the two individuals, paying close attention to their body language and facial expressions in the context of the setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, an older man and woman are hugging each other, which suggests a strong emotional connection between them. Their body language, as they hold each other in their arms tightly, demonstrates warmth, love, and affection. Their facial expressions, including smiles, show that they are happy and enjoying each other's company. The setting where they are hugging, which is an outdoor area with a building nearby, implies that they might be attending an event or gathering, further supporting the idea that the embrace signifies an important occasion or special moment in their lives. This act of affection between the elderly couple reflects the long-lasting and deep bond they share, serving as a reminder of the importance of love and companionship across different generations.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis embrace conveys a deep sense of affection and comfort.  The man's face, with closed eyes and a slight smile, suggests contentment and a feeling of being at peace in the woman's arms.  His tight hold, particularly the placement of his hands on her back and shoulder, speaks of cherishing and protectiveness.\n\nThe woman's face is less visible, but her firm grip on the man's back and shoulders indicates the embrace is reciprocal.  Her burying her face in his chest could signify a need for comfort, trust, or simply a desire for closeness.\n\nThe casual backyard setting, with laundry hanging in the background, suggests a familiar and intimate environment. This adds to the feeling that the embrace is a genuine and private moment shared between two people with a strong emotional bond. It's not a posed or formal embrace, but one that speaks to a comfortable and long-standing relationship, perhaps between a husband and wife or other close family members. The black and white filter enhances the timeless quality of the image and emphasizes the raw emotion of the moment.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by facial expression of peacefulness indicating a sense of comfort and happiness\n2. Analyze the facial expression and body language",
