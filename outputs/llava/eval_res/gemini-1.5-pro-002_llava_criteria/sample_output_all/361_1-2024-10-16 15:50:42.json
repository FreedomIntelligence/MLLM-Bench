Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompose a poem about a mountain sunrise, the solitary hiker, and the interplay of dawn light with nature.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the mist, a lone hiker stands\nIn the shadow of the mountain range\nWith the sun rising in the distance,\nHe gazes on the spectacle before him.\n\nThe sky turns shades of purple and red\nAs mountains meet the horizon line\nThe sun peaking from behind its crest\nBringing warmth and life to the scene.\n\nA backpacker, he's made his way to this view\nThrough mountain trails and winding paths\nTo witness the dawn's majestic glow\nOn the peaks and through the valleys.\n\nBut it's not just the sun's golden hue\nThat draws him to the summit's heights\nIt's also the peace and solitude they bring\nThe stillness of the world beneath.\n\nThe hiker embraces the quiet dawn\nAs the sun lifts the mountain's veil\nHe stands in awe, his soul reborn\nAmidst the wonders of nature's tale.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nAtop the world, where granite teeth bite sky,\nA lone soul stands, as dawn begins to dye\nThe eastern canvas with a blush of rose.\nThe sun, a molten coin, from slumber flows,\nAnd spills its light across the jagged peaks,\nIgniting mists that swirl in ghostly streaks.\n\nThe hiker pauses, shielded from the chill,\nHis breath a plume, the air crisp, sharp, and still.\nHe lifts his hands, a frame against the light,\nTo capture beauty, banish fading night.\nThe lens reflects the fire in the air,\nA prism's dance, a moment held with care.\n\nThe valleys deep, still cloaked in indigo,\nAwait the touch of sunrise, soft and slow.\nThe mountain's face, a tapestry of gold,\nReflects the warmth, a story to unfold.\nThe wind, a whisper, through the stillness creeps,\nAs nature wakes, and the lone hiker weeps,\n\nNot tears of sorrow, but of pure delight,\nTo witness such a grand and sacred sight.\nA symphony of color, light, and shade,\nA fleeting glimpse, a memory gently made.\nAnd as the sun ascends its fiery throne,\nHe stands in awe, on that peak, all alone. \n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes mountain sunrise, solitary hiker, and dawn light with nature.\n2. Imagery captures the beauty and interplay of light in nature.\n3. Tone conveys the mood and experience of a solitary hike at dawn.",
