    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe instructions describe a gentle, methodical approach to opening a new book, designed to avoid damaging the spine:\n\n1. **Lay the book spine-down on a table.**\n2. **Open the front cover, laying it flat on the table.**\n3. **Open the back cover, laying it flat on the table.**\n4. **Open a few pages at the front of the book, gently pressing them down towards the table.**\n5. **Open a few pages at the back of the book, gently pressing them down towards the table.**\n6. **Repeat steps 4 and 5, alternating between front and back, a few pages at a time, working your way towards the center of the book, until all pages have been gently pressed open.**\n7. **Repeat the entire process two or three times to further loosen the spine.**\n\nThe instructions emphasize the importance of gentleness, warning against forcing the spine open and recommending treating the book like a machine that needs lubrication.  They also include an anecdote about a bookbinder whose customer damaged a new book by opening it forcefully, reinforcing the importance of the described method.\n\n\n**Evaluation of Clarity and Effectiveness:**\n\nThe instructions are generally clear and effective, using simple language and clear visuals. The step-by-step format with accompanying images makes the process easy to follow.  The use of the anecdote adds a memorable element that highlights the consequences of improper handling.\n\nHowever, some minor improvements could be made:\n\n* **Specificity about \"a few leaves\":** While the instructions say \"a few leaves,\" they don't specify an exact number.  Suggesting a specific small number (e.g., 5-10) might be helpful.\n* **Emphasis on \"gently pressing\":** While the instructions mention \"gently pressing,\" they could further emphasize this point by specifying *how* to press (e.g., with the palm of the hand, distributed pressure).\n* **Visual clarity:** The images are helpful, but slightly more detailed drawings, perhaps showing the hand position during the pressing, could enhance understanding.\n\nOverall, the instructions are effective in conveying the importance of careful book opening and provide a clear method for doing so.  Minor additions could further improve their clarity and impact.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List steps to open a new book: place on table, front cover, back cover, alternate leaves, press gently, repeat if needed.\n2. Assess if instructions are clear: sequential order, simple language, easy to follow.\n3. Evaluate effectiveness: steps lead to opening without damaging the book's binding.",
