    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman appears to be expressing a combination of **apprehension, discomfort, and a desire to create distance or stop something**.  Her raised hand, slightly blurred, suggests a defensive posture. Her other hand touches her face, a gesture often associated with anxiety or stress. Her gaze is directed to the side, possibly at something or someone out of the frame, and her expression seems tense.  She's not showing outright fear or anger, but rather a more subtle blend of unease and a need to protect herself.\n\nHere are some possible contexts that could be causing this emotion:\n\n* **Being approached by someone unwanted:**  She might be trying to ward off an unwelcome advance, whether physical or verbal, from a stranger or someone she knows.\n* **Witnessing something upsetting:** Perhaps she's seen something disturbing or uncomfortable and is reacting with a mix of shock and a desire to not see more.\n* **Feeling overwhelmed or anxious in a social situation:**  The blurred foreground element and her averted gaze could indicate she's feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings and is trying to create some personal space.\n* **Reacting to a sudden, unexpected movement or noise:**  She might have been startled by something and is instinctively raising her hand in a defensive reaction.\n* **Having a flashback or experiencing a panic attack:** Her expression and gestures could be indicative of an internal struggle, such as reliving a traumatic memory or experiencing a surge of anxiety.\n* **Trying to stop someone from saying or doing something:**  She might be trying to interrupt a conversation or prevent someone from making a mistake or causing harm.\n* **Experiencing a sensory overload:** The blurred foreground could symbolize an overwhelming sensory experience, causing her to shield herself and turn away.\n\n\nThe ambiguity of the image allows for multiple interpretations, but the core emotion seems to revolve around a sense of unease and a need to establish a boundary.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
