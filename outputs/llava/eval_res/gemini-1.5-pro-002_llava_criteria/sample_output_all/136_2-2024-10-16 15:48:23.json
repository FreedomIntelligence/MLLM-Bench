    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe architectural style is **Baroque/Neoclassical**, leaning more towards Neoclassical given the relative restraint in ornamentation compared to high Baroque. The space demonstrates characteristics of both:\n\n* **Baroque:**  Grand scale, use of rich color (deep reds and golds), ornate cornices and ceiling details, and an emphasis on creating a sense of awe and drama. The skylight also contributes to the Baroque interest in light and shadow.\n* **Neoclassical:**  The symmetry and balance of the layout, the relatively uncluttered wall spaces between paintings, and the geometric parquet flooring are indicative of Neoclassical influences.\n\nThe cultural function is that of an **art museum gallery**. The space is designed for the display and appreciation of artworks.  The arrangement of paintings along the walls, the controlled lighting (from the skylight and presumably supplemental sources), and the presence of visitors suggest its purpose as a public space for viewing art.  The benches provide a place for contemplation and rest.  The layout encourages a processional movement through the gallery, guiding viewers from one artwork to the next.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style elements like wall decor, ceiling, and lighting.\n2. Determine cultural function based on room contents and visitor activity.",
