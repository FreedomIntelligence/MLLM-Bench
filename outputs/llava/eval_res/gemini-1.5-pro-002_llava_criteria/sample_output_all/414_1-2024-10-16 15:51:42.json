Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a dense caption detailing the various constellations depicted in the historical star map, including their names, the shapes they are associated with, and any notable stars or celestial objects contained within them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe historical star map depicts various constellations in a large circle. These constellations are named after the celestial objects they represent or are associated with. Some of the constellations include Orion, which is known for its prominent hunter figure with a shield and club. Another notable constellation is Cetus, which is shaped like a sea monster and contains the star Mirach. Additionally, there is Lepus, a small constellation situated near Orion, with a hare as its mascot. The diverse shapes and names of the constellations, along with the inclusion of notable stars like Mirach, make this historical star map fascinating and a testament to the rich history of celestial observations and cataloguing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis historical star map depicts the constellations of the zodiac and other prominent celestial figures. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise:\n\n* **Pisces (The Fishes):** Two fish tied together with a ribbon.\n* **Aquarius (The Water Bearer):** A human figure pouring water from a vessel.\n* **Capricornus (The Sea Goat):** A creature with the head of a goat and the tail of a fish.\n* **Sagittarius (The Archer):** A centaur aiming a bow and arrow.  Antinous, a now obsolete constellation, is depicted at Sagittarius's feet.\n* **Scorpius (The Scorpion):** A scorpion with its tail curved upwards.\n* **Libra (The Scales):** A set of weighing scales.\n* **Virgo (The Virgin):** A female figure often associated with harvest.\n* **Leo (The Lion):** A lion.\n* **Cancer (The Crab):** A crab.\n* **Gemini (The Twins):** Two human figures representing twins.\n* **Taurus (The Bull):** A bull, often depicted with only its front half.\n* **Aries (The Ram):** A ram.\n* **Perseus:** A hero holding the head of Medusa.\n* **Auriga (The Charioteer):** A charioteer holding reins and often a goat.\n* **Triangulum (The Triangle):** A triangle formed by three stars.\n* **Andromeda:** A princess chained to a rock.\n* **Pegasus (The Winged Horse):** A winged horse.\n* **Cassiopeia:** A queen seated on a throne.\n* **Cepheus:** A king.\n* **Draco (The Dragon):** A dragon winding between the other constellations.\n* **Ursa Minor (The Little Bear or Little Dipper):** A smaller bear containing Polaris, the North Star, at the tip of its tail.\n* **Ursa Major (The Great Bear or Big Dipper):** A larger bear, its tail forming the familiar \"dipper\" asterism.\n* **Boötes (The Herdsman):** A herdsman, sometimes depicted with hunting dogs.\n* **Corona Borealis (The Northern Crown):** A semicircular crown.\n* **Serpens (The Serpent):** A serpent held by Ophiuchus (not labelled, but implied by the positioning of Serpens), depicted in two parts: Serpens Caput (the head) and Serpens Cauda (the tail).\n* **Hercules:** A kneeling hero.\n* **Lyra (The Lyre):** A lyre, a stringed musical instrument.\n* **Aquila (The Eagle):** An eagle.\n* **Delphinus (The Dolphin):** A dolphin leaping from the water.\n* **Equuleus (The Little Horse or Foal):** A small horse's head.\n\nThe map also indicates the celestial equator (Aequinoctialis), the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (Tropicus Cancri, unmarked but implied), the solstitial colure (Colurus Solftitiorum), and uses varying sizes of stars to represent their apparent magnitudes.  The labels \"Prima,\" \"Secun,\" and \"Tertia\" likely refer to magnitudes of stars.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify constellations by name and describe their shapes accurately.\n2. Mention any notable stars or celestial objects within the constellations.\n3. Ensure the description is detailed, reflecting the historical context of the star map.",
