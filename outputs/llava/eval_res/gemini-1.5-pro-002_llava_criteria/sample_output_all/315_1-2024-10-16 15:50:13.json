    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the equation, we can follow the steps of cross multiplication and use the distributive property.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two fractions with common numerators and denominators:\n\n(1/2) x (8/4) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can take the simplified equation to its next level by factoring the numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/2) = 2/4 = (1/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 - 1/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nThis means the equation is already simplified and there are no further steps to take. The final answer is 0.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's how to simplify the complex fraction:\n\n1. **Simplify the numerator:**\n   x/(x+1) + 1  becomes (x + (x+1))/(x+1) = (2x+1)/(x+1)\n\n2. **Simplify the denominator:**\n   1 - x/(x-1) becomes ((x-1) - x)/(x-1) = -1/(x-1)\n\n3. **Divide the numerator by the denominator:**  Remember dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\n   [(2x+1)/(x+1)] / [-1/(x-1)] = [(2x+1)/(x+1)] * [(x-1)/-1] =  -(2x+1)(x-1) / (x+1)\n\n4. **Expand the numerator (optional):**\n   -(2x² - 2x + x - 1) / (x+1) = (-2x² + x + 1) / (x+1) \n\nSo the simplified form is **(-2x² + x + 1) / (x+1)** or **-(2x+1)(x-1) / (x+1)**.  Both are equivalent.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3. Final answer should be mathematically equivalent to the original equation.",
