    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the text in the image and the implicit message conveyed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe text in the image is a saying or a motivational quote, which reads \"Life is a Straight Road to Success.\" The message conveyed by this quote is that success is a direct and clear pathway, and that with determination and effort, one can achieve success in life. The red background and bold lettering emphasize the importance and positivity of the message.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe text says: \"LIFE IS A STRAIGHT ROAD TO SUCCESS\".\n\nThe implicit message, conveyed through the chaotic black scribbles surrounding the neat red \"road\" and text, is ironic. It suggests that the idea of a \"straight road to success\" is simplistic and naive. Life is messy and complex, not a straightforward path.  The smiley faces within the chaos could be interpreted as either oblivious to this reality or perhaps finding joy despite the lack of a clear path.  The stark contrast between the neat text and the messy background emphasizes the irony.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately transcribe all text: \"Life is a straight road to success.\"\n2. Describe the image's implicit message or metaphor.",
