    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSeveral relationships are possible:\n\n* **Manager/employee:** The man could be the woman's manager, conducting a performance review or discussing a project.  His taking notes would support this.\n* **Interviewer/interviewee:** The woman could be interviewing for a job with the man.  Again, the note-taking suggests this.\n* **Colleagues:** They could be co-workers discussing a work-related matter.\n* **Mentor/mentee:** The man could be mentoring the woman, offering advice and guidance.\n* **Client/consultant:** The woman could be a client explaining her needs to a consultant (the man).\n\n\nThe most likely scenarios based on the image are manager/employee or interviewer/interviewee.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the person holding the pen is likely the interviewer, while the person speaking to him is the interviewee. The interviewee is sitting in front of the interviewer, and the interviewer has a book open, which suggests that he might be taking notes or referring to some information during the conversation. The interaction between them takes place on a table, reinforcing the perception that this is a professional setting and an interview context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional relationship based on attire, setting, and body language.\n2. Assess dialogue cues suggesting hierarchy, cooperation, or advisory roles.",
