    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCalculate the value of I in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the equation provided in the image, I is equal to 4. Sin(2I).\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere's how to calculate the integral:\n\n**1. Rewrite the integral:**\n\nThe integral can be written as:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ (∫₀¹ 4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2) dy) dx\n\n**2. Integrate with respect to y:**\n\nSince the integrand doesn't contain y, integrating with respect to y simply multiplies the integrand by y and evaluates it from 0 to 1:\n\nI = ∫₀¹ [ (4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2)) * y ]₀¹ dx\nI = ∫₀¹ (4sin²(πx) / (x-1/2)) dx\n\n**3. Recognize the problem:**\n\nThe function 1/(x - 1/2) has a vertical asymptote at x = 1/2, which is within the interval of integration [0, 1]. This means the integral is improper.  We need to investigate the behavior of the integral around this singularity.\n\n**4.  Consider the limit:**\n\nLet's consider the behavior of the integrand near x = 1/2:\n\nAs x approaches 1/2, sin²(πx) approaches sin²(π/2) = 1.  The term 4sin²(πx) approaches 4.\n\nTherefore, the integrand behaves like 4/(x-1/2) near x = 1/2.  This is of the form 1/(x-a), which is known to diverge when integrated across the singularity.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nBecause the integrand has a non-integrable singularity at x = 1/2, the integral *diverges*.  Therefore, the value of I is undefined or infinite. It does not converge to a finite value.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer correctly calculates I as -25/56 from the integral in the image.\n2. Solution demonstrates understanding of integral calculus and trigonometric identities.\n3. Response includes a step-by-step explanation of the integral calculation process.",
