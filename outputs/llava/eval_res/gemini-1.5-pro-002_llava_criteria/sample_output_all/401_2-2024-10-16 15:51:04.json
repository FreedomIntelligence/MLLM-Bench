    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the elements in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image presents a seamless repeating pattern of stylized flowers and foliage on a dark teal background.  Several different floral motifs are interwoven:\n\n* **Large, pointed, multi-layered flowers:** These are the most prominent elements. They have pointed, often layered petals in shades of red, orange, and yellow, sometimes with lighter centers.  They appear in various orientations.\n* **Smaller, simpler flowers:** These are scattered throughout the pattern, often near the larger flowers or along the stems.  They typically have fewer petals and come in red, yellow, or a combination of light teal/gray and red.  Some of these resemble stylized daisies or asters.\n* **Trumpet-shaped flowers:** These distinctive flowers have a bell or trumpet-like shape, typically with a red and orange body and a yellow interior. They often extend horizontally or diagonally.\n* **Light teal/gray and red/maroon flowers:** These flowers have a more complex shape, with petals that seem to curve inwards and then flare out. They have a light teal/gray outer section and a darker red/maroon center.\n* **Foliage:**  The flowers are connected by curving stems and stylized leaves. The leaves are predominantly a medium green, with some lighter, almost teal/gray leaves interspersed.  Small, round red berries are scattered along the stems.\n\n\nThe overall effect is a dense, richly detailed floral pattern reminiscent of traditional textile designs, possibly with influences from chintz or other folk art styles. The color palette is warm and slightly muted, with the dark teal background making the brighter colors of the flowers pop.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a bright, vibrant floral pattern with various colors and decorative elements. The design creates a cheerful and lively atmosphere. The pattern is composed of numerous flowers, some larger and more prominent, while others are smaller and situated throughout the image.\n\nIn addition to the flowers, there is a bird flying through the air, adding an intriguing element to the scene. The combination of the flowers, the bird, and the vibrant colors makes the image visually appealing and captivating.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the variety of flowers and leaves, noting colors and patterns.\n2. Describe the overall design and repetition in the floral pattern.\n3. Identify the background color and how it complements the elements.",
