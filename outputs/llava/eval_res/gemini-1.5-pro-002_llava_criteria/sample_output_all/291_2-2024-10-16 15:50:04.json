    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of wear of the headset, and infer the possible cause of the wear.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headset headband shows significant wear. The outer covering, likely a synthetic leather or pleather material, is peeling and flaking away, revealing a grey fabric underneath.  The wear is concentrated along the top of the band, suggesting it's the area subject to the most stress and friction.\n\nPossible causes of this wear include:\n\n* **General use and age:**  Over time, materials like synthetic leather can break down, especially with repeated flexing and stretching.\n* **Sweat and body oils:**  Contact with skin can accelerate the deterioration of the headband material.\n* **Improper storage:**  Storing the headset in a hot environment, under direct sunlight, or in a cramped space could contribute to the material degradation.\n* **Contact with abrasive surfaces:**  Rubbing against rough surfaces, like clothing or a backpack, could cause the outer layer to peel.\n* **Chemical exposure:**  Certain cleaning products or cosmetics could react with the headband material and cause damage.\n\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more information, but the pattern of wear suggests a combination of general use, sweat/body oils, and possibly friction from clothing or storage.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is holding a black headset with a fuzzy texture on the headband and ear pads. The headset appears to be worn down to the fabric, which indicates significant wear and tear. The possible cause of this wear could be regular use over a prolonged period, as headsets are often used daily by people engaged in activities such as gaming, listening to music, or participating in online meetings. The wear could also be a result of a lack of proper care, such as not regularly cleaning the headset or storing it in a dusty or poorly organized space. Overall, the headset's condition suggests that it has been used extensively and not well-maintained.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify wear on headset: peeling material, discoloration, deformation.\n2. Infer wear causes: usage, material quality, environmental factors.",
