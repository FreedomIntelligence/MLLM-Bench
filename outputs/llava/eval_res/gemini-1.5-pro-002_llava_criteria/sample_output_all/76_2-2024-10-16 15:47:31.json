    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify the type of event taking place and describe the atmosphere of the event based on visual and lighting cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis is a large-scale **concert** taking place in a stadium. \n\nThe atmosphere is energetic and engaging. Several cues suggest this:\n\n* **Pink lights:** The dominant pink glow from the audience's light-up wristbands creates a unified and vibrant feel, suggesting a shared excitement.\n* **Stage lighting and effects:** The colorful stage lighting, smoke effects, and large circular screens displaying the performer add to the dynamic and theatrical nature of the event.\n* **Large crowd:** The stadium is packed, indicating a popular performer and a high level of audience engagement.\n* **Audience participation:**  The raised hands and general posture of the audience members in the foreground suggest they are actively participating and enjoying the music.\n* **Performer's image:** The performer on the screen appears to be playing a guitar, reinforcing the musical nature of the event and likely contributing to the energy.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a concert event where a crowd of people is gathered in a venue to watch a band perform. The atmosphere in the venue is vibrant, as evidenced by the pink smoke that fills the air and the neon lights illuminating the scene.
