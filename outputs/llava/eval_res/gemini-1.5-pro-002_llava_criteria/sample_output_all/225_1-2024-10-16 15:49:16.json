    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the linear flow of energy in these food chains.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays several food chains, showing the linear flow of energy from plants to animals. These food chains include a carnivorous plant, such as a Venus flytrap and an aquatic plant like a water lily, both of which consume smaller organisms as their primary food source. The linear flow of energy is evident as the smaller organisms, such as insects or small fish, are consumed by larger organisms, like predators or carnivorous plants. The larger organisms, in turn, may be preyed upon by even larger animals, like lions or eagles. The image emphasizes the interconnection and dependency of various species in the ecosystem and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and healthy environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts three separate food chains, each representing a linear flow of energy:\n\n1. **Terrestrial Food Chain 1:**\n   - **Trees** (Producer): Capture solar energy through photosynthesis.\n   - **Deer** (Primary Consumer/Herbivore):  Obtain energy by consuming trees.\n   - **Lion** (Secondary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtains energy by consuming deer.\n\n2. **Terrestrial Food Chain 2:**\n   - **Flower** (Producer): Captures solar energy through photosynthesis.\n   - **Flies** (Primary Consumer/Herbivore or Detritivore): Obtain energy by consuming the flower's nectar or decaying matter.\n   - **Frog** (Secondary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtains energy by consuming flies.\n   - **Snake** (Tertiary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtains energy by consuming frogs.\n   - **Eagle** (Quaternary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtains energy by consuming snakes.\n\n3. **Aquatic Food Chain:**\n   - **Flower/Aquatic Plants** (Producer): Captures solar energy through photosynthesis.\n   - **Small Fishes** (Primary Consumer/Herbivore or Omnivore): Obtain energy by consuming aquatic plants or small organisms.\n   - **Larger Fish** (Secondary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtains energy by consuming small fishes.\n   - **Birds** (Tertiary Consumer/Carnivore): Obtain energy by consuming larger fish.\n\n\nIn each chain, the arrows indicate the direction of energy flow, from the source (producer) to the various consumers.  At each step, some energy is lost as heat. Consequently, organisms at higher trophic levels receive less energy than those at lower levels.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The first chain: trees -> deers -> lion\n2. The second chain: flower -> flies -> frog -> snake -> eagle.\n3. The third chain: flower -> small fishes -> larger fish -> birds.\n4. There is no strict format in describing each chain. However, the answer should explicitly and accurately points out every element on each chain.",
