    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the main topic of the image, and assign a proper hashtag for this image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a person recreating a character, seemingly a Viking, using a broom as a beard. The top two images show the person holding the broom, while the bottom two compare the recreation to the original cartoon character.\n\nA suitable hashtag would be #lowcostcosplay. Other options could include #cosplay #vikingcosplay #broombeard #creativecosplay #diycosplay #animecosplay #mangacosplay #budgetcosplay.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a series of four different photos of a man holding a large broom. In each frame, the man's appearance changes, including the size of the broom, the man's attire, and the overall setting.
