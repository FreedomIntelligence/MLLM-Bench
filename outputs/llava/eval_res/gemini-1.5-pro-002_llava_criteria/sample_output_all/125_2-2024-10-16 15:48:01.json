    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the childâ€™s behavior to infer the narrative and sentiment being portrayed\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe child is hiding under the covers, peering over the top with wide, apprehensive eyes. The lighting is dim, adding to the sense of unease. This suggests a narrative of fear or anxiety.  The sentiment portrayed is one of vulnerability and apprehension. The child is likely scared of something, perhaps imagined or real, and is seeking comfort and security under the blanket.  It could be a fear of the dark, a nightmare, or something else unseen and unsettling.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a little girl is pulling the sheet down over her face while lying in bed. Her action of partially hiding herself could be interpreted as a playful act or a sign of shyness or fear. It is difficult to determine the exact context or narrative behind her behavior, but it could be a moment captured in a childhood scenario or a scene from a movie or story. The sentiment being portrayed appears to be a light-hearted one, with the little girl expressing either playfulness, curiosity, or a sense of unease in her current situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the child's emotion from facial expression and body language.\n2. Describe the narrative context implied by the child's behavior.",
