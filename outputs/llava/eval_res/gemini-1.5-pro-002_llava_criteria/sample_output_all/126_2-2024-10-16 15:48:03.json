    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the sentiment expressed in the interaction between the two foxes, taking into account the use of brushstrokes and color choice to convey emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image expresses a sentiment of **tender affection and love**, likely between a parent fox and its cub.  \n\nThe **gentle nuzzling** of the noses is the central point of the image, conveying intimacy and closeness. The closed eyes of both foxes enhance this sense of peaceful connection.\n\nThe **warm, vibrant orange and yellow hues** create a feeling of warmth and happiness. The colors are also naturally associated with foxes, adding to the sense of natural, familial love.\n\nThe **soft, flowing brushstrokes** used to depict the fur contribute to the overall gentle and loving mood. There's a slight blurring or blending of the colors where the two foxes touch, further visually representing their close bond.  The lack of harsh lines or sharp details reinforces the tenderness of the scene.\n\n\nOverall, the artist effectively uses color and brushwork to depict a heartwarming moment of affection between two foxes, evoking feelings of love, warmth, and family.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe interaction between the two foxes, with one kissing or rubbing its nose against the other's, conveys a sense of affection, love, and closeness. The use of watercolors and the choice of colors, such as red and orange, reinforce the warm and tender sentiment. The soft lines and watercolor style of the painting further emphasize the gentle and intimate nature of their interaction. In this image, the artist effectively uses the visual elements to create a sense of emotion and convey the depth of the relationship between the two foxes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sentiment of the interaction: affectionate, aggressive, playful, etc.\n2. Describe how color choice enhances the perceived emotion: warm, cool, contrasting, etc.\n3.
