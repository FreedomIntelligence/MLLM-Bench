Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a winter ballad on the solitude and muffled world under snow, reflecting life's resilience in a monochrome setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the snow-covered scene, a man alone walks\nHis solitary steps echo in the crunchy ground\nSilent, muffled, the world around him hushes\nThe snow-muffled world, a monochrome landscape\n\nThe trees and buildings wear a white shroud\nBare branches stretch, reaching out frozen hands\nThe wind howls through the streets, whipped by the snow\nAs the man walks, his footprints swiftly fade away\n\nIn this frozen world, life's resilience lives on\nAmidst the white and grey, a colorless but persistent hue\nA man, though the snow may cover, continues on his way\nEmbracing the cold, the winter's melancholy song he'll sing\n\nIn the end, the snow will melt, and the world revealed\nThe man may find warmth, and perhaps, a heart to mend\nBut until then, in this solitude, he braves the cold\nA lone figure in a silent, snow-muffled world.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe snow falls soft, a monochrome embrace,\nA hush descends, on time and space.\nThe world is muffled, sounds subdued,\nA canvas painted, solitude imbued.\n\nA lone figure, in shades of grey,\nTrudges onward, come what may.\nThrough streets deserted, buildings stark,\nA silent journey, leaving its mark.\n\nThe snow-laden branches, bowed and low,\nWhisper stories, of the winds that blow.\nOf frozen earth, and skies of lead,\nWhere life lies dormant, seemingly dead.\n\nYet beneath the blanket, white and deep,\nA pulse persists, secrets to keep.\nThe seeds of spring, in slumber lie,\nAwaiting warmth, beneath a frosted sky.\n\nAnd so the man, in his winter coat,\nA mirror to resilience, a hopeful note.\nHe walks alone, in this silent scene,\nA testament to life, ever keen.\n\nFor even in the monochrome's hold,\nA strength remains, a story told.\nOf life's endurance, its quiet might,\nA flicker of hope, in the fading light. \n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Includes imagery of solitude, snow's muffled world, and monochrome setting.\n2. Reflects life's resilience in the context of a winter scene.\n3.
