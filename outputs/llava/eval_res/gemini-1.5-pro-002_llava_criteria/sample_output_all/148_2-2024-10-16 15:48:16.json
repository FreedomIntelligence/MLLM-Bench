    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor comes from the cat's posture and the superimposed text \"MONDAYS...\".\n\n* **The cat's posture:** The cat is curled up tight, with its face buried in its paws and body. This posture suggests misery, exhaustion, or a desire to avoid something.  It's a relatable image for anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed or dread.\n\n* **The text \"MONDAYS...\":**  This connects the cat's posture to the common feeling of dread or reluctance associated with the start of the work/school week. Mondays are often seen as the end of relaxing weekends and the return to responsibilities, making them a frequent target of complaints.\n\nThe combination of the image and text creates a humorous analogy: the cat's defeated posture perfectly embodies the feeling many people have about Mondays.  It's funny because it's a recognizable and exaggerated portrayal of a shared experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
