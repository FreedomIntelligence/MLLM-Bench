    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotional exchange occurring between the individuals by considering their hand gestures, facial expressions, and the proximity to one another.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the man and the woman are facing each other, engaged in a heated exchange. The woman is pointing her finger at the man, which often signifies a direct, assertive, or even confrontational tone in their conversation. Meanwhile, the man is smiling, which may indicate that he is either enjoying the interaction, trying to diffuse the situation, or simply being playful. The close proximity of the individuals further emphasizes the intensity of their emotional exchange. Overall, the scene suggests a lively and potentially tension-filled conversation between the two people.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe couple is clearly in a heated argument.  Their facial expressions and hand gestures convey anger and frustration.\n\n* **The woman:** Her raised voice, indicated by her open mouth and tense facial muscles, suggests she's yelling. Her pointed finger is an accusatory gesture, directing blame at the man. Her other hand is gesturing outward, possibly expressing exasperation or trying to explain her point.\n\n* **The man:**  His open mouth and slightly raised eyebrows suggest he's also speaking in a raised voice, likely responding defensively.  His pointed finger mirrors the woman's, indicating he's also assigning blame or arguing back.\n\n* **Proximity and Body Language:** While not extremely close, their stance suggests they are engaged with each other, despite the negative emotions.  They are facing each other directly, indicating a confrontation. The overall impression is one of an active, possibly escalating, argument where both individuals are feeling angry and unwilling to back down.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by both individuals' facial expressions and hand gestures as angry.\n2. Describe the nature of the emotional exchange based on proximity and body language.",
