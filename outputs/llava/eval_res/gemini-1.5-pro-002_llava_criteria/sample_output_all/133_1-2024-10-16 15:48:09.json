    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image,  describe the settings and identify the type of activity taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a person sitting at a desk with two desktop computer screens and a keyboard in front of them. The individual is engaged in a video game activity, using the computer screens to play an online video game. It appears to be a gaming setup, possibly for a multiplayer or first-person shooter game, given the presence of two screens and a keyboard for controlling the game. The person is focused on the screens, likely interacting with the game to progress through levels or complete objectives.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe setting appears to be a gaming cafe or a dedicated gaming room. It's dimly lit, with the primary light sources coming from the computer monitors and the peripherals.  There are multiple computer setups visible, suggesting a multiplayer environment.  The person in focus is using a gaming keyboard with RGB lighting, a gaming mouse, and wearing over-ear headphones with a glowing red ring.\n\nThe activity taking place is competitive video gaming, likely a first-person shooter (FPS) game, as suggested by the on-screen display elements (HUD) showing a map, health/ammo indicators, and what looks like a player lying on the ground.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify indoor setting with computer gaming equipment.\n2. Recognize the activity as playing a video game.",
