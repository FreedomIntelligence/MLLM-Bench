    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces to protect themselves from a **sandstorm** or **dust storm**.  They are using veils, wraps, and even pulling clothing up over their noses and mouths to keep from inhaling the dust and sand.  This is crucial because such storms can cause severe respiratory problems and eye irritation.\n\nThe weather occurrence depicted is a sand or dust storm. These are caused by strong winds blowing over loose sand and dust in dry regions, like deserts.  Here's a breakdown of the factors contributing to such storms:\n\n* **Dry Conditions:**  A lack of moisture in the soil allows the sand and dust particles to become loose and easily lifted by the wind. Deserts, by definition, are arid regions with minimal rainfall, making them prime locations for these storms.\n* **Strong Winds:**  High wind speeds are necessary to lift and transport the sand and dust particles. These winds can be caused by various weather systems, including thunderstorms, downdrafts, and pressure gradients.\n* **Lack of Vegetation:**  Plants and their root systems help to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. In desert environments, where vegetation is sparse, there's little to stop the wind from picking up loose particles.\n* **Surface Heating and Instability:** Intense solar radiation heating the ground can create unstable air masses, leading to rising air and stronger winds. This further contributes to the formation and intensity of dust storms.\n\n\nIn summary, the people are protecting their faces from the harmful effects of inhaled sand and dust during a sand/dust storm. These storms are a natural phenomenon in arid regions, driven by a combination of dry conditions, strong winds, lack of vegetation, and atmospheric instability.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
