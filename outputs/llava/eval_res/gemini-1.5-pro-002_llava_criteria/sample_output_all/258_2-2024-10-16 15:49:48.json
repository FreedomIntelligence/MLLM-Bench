    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the upper side and lower side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are five differences between the top and bottom images:\n\n1. **Person with brown hair's shirt:** In the top image, they are wearing a dark brown shirt. In the bottom image, it's light brown.\n2. **Person with brown hair's expression:** In the top image, their mouth is a simple curved line. In the bottom image, their mouth is open in a smile, showing teeth.\n3. **Person with blonde hair's expression:** In the top image, their mouth is a simple line, and they appear neutral. In the bottom image, their mouth is open, and they seem to be talking.\n4. **Person with orange dress's socks:** In the top image, their socks are green. In the bottom image, they are teal/blue-green.\n5. **Drink in front of the person with the laptop:** In the top image, it's a light green mug. In the bottom image, it's a yellow/orange mug.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the upper side of the image, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones, whereas in the lower side, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones. However, the differences between the two images include the poses of the people and the layout of the table. The people in the upper image are in different poses and are not all in the same positions as in the lower image. There is also a bottle visible in both images, but its placement on the table is different. Additionally, the presence of a dining table and chairs is common to both images, but the design or style of the table and chairs may differ.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in logo direction, object colors in hand, right foot direction, hair style, and chair legs.",
