    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the evolution of presidential vehicles shown, and considering broader automotive design trends, we can infer several directions for future automotive design:\n\n* **Increased Emphasis on Security:**  Presidential cars have progressively become more armored and secure. This trend will likely continue, with advancements in materials science and security technology leading to even more robust and discreet protection measures.  This could include active defense systems, advanced communication capabilities, and even autonomous evasion maneuvers.\n\n* **Sustainable Powertrains:** While not explicitly shown in the early models, the move towards electric and hybrid vehicles is a dominant trend. Future presidential vehicles will almost certainly be electric or utilize some form of alternative fuel, reflecting a global shift towards sustainability and reduced emissions.\n\n* **Autonomous Features:**  Self-driving technology is rapidly maturing. While full autonomy for a presidential vehicle might be some way off due to security concerns, we can expect to see increasing integration of autonomous features, such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), for enhanced safety and convenience.\n\n* **Connectivity and Communication:** Presidential vehicles will become increasingly connected, serving as mobile command centers with secure communication systems, real-time intelligence feeds, and advanced situational awareness capabilities.\n\n* **Personalized and Adaptive Interiors:**  Future interiors will likely be highly customizable and adaptable to the president's needs, featuring advanced ergonomic designs, biometric controls, and integrated health monitoring systems.  Think less traditional \"limousine\" and more mobile office/situation room.\n\n* **Discreet Design Language:**  While maintaining a certain level of presence and formality, future presidential vehicles might move towards a more understated and discreet aesthetic, blending in more seamlessly with other vehicles on the road while still incorporating advanced security features invisibly.\n\n* **Focus on Passenger Well-being:**  Beyond security, future designs will prioritize passenger comfort and well-being, incorporating features like air purification systems, noise cancellation, and adaptive climate control.\n\nIt's important to note that presidential vehicles often incorporate cutting-edge technologies before they become mainstream, serving as a showcase for the future of automotive design and engineering.  The focus will likely remain on safety, security, and sustainability, with increasing integration of advanced technologies like AI and autonomy.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
