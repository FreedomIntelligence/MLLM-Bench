    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the activity taking place, why are they pulling the rope?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe children are playing tug-of-war.  They are pulling the rope to try and drag the opposing team across a center line, thus winning the game.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a group of people, including children and teenagers, standing on a field of grass and pulling a rope.
