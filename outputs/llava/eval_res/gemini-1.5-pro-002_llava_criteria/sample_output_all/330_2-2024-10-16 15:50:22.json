    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts the aftermath of a landslide, likely triggered by heavy rainfall or an earthquake.  It's difficult to determine the precise duration of the initial event from the image alone. Landslides can occur suddenly, within minutes, or unfold over a longer period, especially if preceded by days of heavy rain saturating the ground.  However, the damage suggests a rapid, high-intensity event.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Extensive destruction:** Houses are crushed, splintered, and partially buried. This level of damage points to a powerful and swift force.\n* **Debris field:** The wide swathe of mud, trees, and building debris indicates a large and forceful movement of earth.\n* **Mud consistency:** The mud appears relatively wet and unconsolidated, suggesting a recent event.  If it had been days, the mud might be drier and more compacted.\n\nWhile the initial landslide was likely short-lived, the *impact* is ongoing. The presence of rescue workers in protective gear indicates an active emergency response, suggesting the disaster's immediate consequences are still being addressed.  The excavator also points to ongoing recovery efforts.\n\nIn summary:  The landslide itself was likely a short, violent event, possibly minutes in duration. However, the intensity was high, judging by the widespread destruction.  The disaster's impact is still being felt, as evidenced by the ongoing rescue and recovery operations.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
