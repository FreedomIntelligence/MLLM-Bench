    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, classify the main activity occurring, and provide context for the setting, such as the likely location, time of day, and occasion for the gathering.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main activity is **watching a movie or presentation on a large outdoor screen**.\n\n* **Setting:** The location appears to be the grounds of a modern school or community center, possibly in East Asia given the architectural style and the apparent demographics of the crowd.  The running track suggests a sports field or similar open area adjacent to the building.\n* **Time of Day:**  It's evening, after sunset, as evidenced by the dark sky and the artificial lighting illuminating the building and the screen.\n* **Occasion:** This looks like a casual community event, perhaps a movie night, open-air presentation, or some other form of entertainment offered to local residents or students. The QR code displayed on the screen likely provides additional information about the event or facilitates some interactive element.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main activity in the image is a group of people sitting and watching a screen, likely projected onto a building, possibly at a sports event. They are sitting close to each other on the ground, which suggests a casual and outdoors setting. The people are engaged with the screen, and some of them are using cell phones, which indicates a current or ongoing event, such as a sports match or a public demonstration. The presence of a clock in the scene suggests that the gathering is taking place during the evening or night.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the main activity: people gathered, watching a screen at an outdoor event.\n2. Describe the setting: likely a public space near a modern building, during evening or night.\n3. Mention the occasion: could be a community event, movie screening, or similar gathering.",
