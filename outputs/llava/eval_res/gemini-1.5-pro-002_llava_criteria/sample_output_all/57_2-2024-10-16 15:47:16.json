    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the significance of the temple shown in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis is the **Rōmon Gate (楼門, two-storied gate) of Fushimi Inari-taisha (伏見稲荷大社)**, a Shinto shrine in Kyoto, Japan.\n\nIts significance lies in several aspects:\n\n* **Importance within the shrine complex:**  It's the main gate to the Fushimi Inari Shrine, a significant Shinto shrine dedicated to Inari, the god of rice, sake, agriculture, industry, and worldly success.  Passing through this gate marks the entrance to the sacred grounds.\n* **Donation by Toyotomi Hideyoshi:**  The gate was donated in 1589 by the powerful feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, adding to its historical importance. This act demonstrates the shrine's importance even during that period.\n* **Visual representation of Inari worship:** The two statues of foxes (kitsune) flanking the gate are messengers (and sometimes considered manifestations) of Inari. They are a key visual element connected to the deity and the shrine itself.\n* **Architectural beauty:**  The vibrant vermilion color, intricate details, and imposing two-story structure make it a visually striking example of traditional Japanese religious architecture.  It's a popular photographic subject and a recognizable symbol of the shrine.\n* **Gateway to the Senbon Torii:**  While the Rōmon is impressive, it's just the beginning.  It leads the way to the thousands of vermilion torii gates that wind up the mountain behind the shrine, which are the most famous feature of Fushimi Inari.  The Rōmon serves as a symbolic and literal entrance to this iconic path.\n\n\nTherefore, the Rōmon Gate is significant not only architecturally and historically, but also religiously and culturally, representing the essence of Fushimi Inari Shrine and its dedication to Inari.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe significance of the temple in the image can be inferred from its impressive and intricate design elements, such as the red and gold color scheme, the presence of statues, dragons, and lanterns, and the large staircases leading up to its entrance. These features suggest that the temple is an important place of worship and reflection for the local community, possibly serving as a landmark or tourist attraction. The fact that many people are present in the image, walking up and down the stairs, showcases the temple's cultural value and attraction, further emphasizing its importance in the community.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the temple as \"Fushimi Inari-taisha.\"\n2. List visual clues showing the temple is Fushimi Inari-taisha.\n 3.Describe the significance of the temple.",
