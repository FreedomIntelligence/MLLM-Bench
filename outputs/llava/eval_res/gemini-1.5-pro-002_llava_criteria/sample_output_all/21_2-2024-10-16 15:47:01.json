    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe exercise is the **barbell bench press**.\n\n**Technical essentials:**\n\n* **Lie flat on the bench:** Your back should be slightly arched, feet flat on the floor (or tucked under the bench for a more advanced variation).  Head, shoulders, and glutes should maintain contact with the bench throughout the movement.\n* **Grip:**  Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n* **Unrack the bar:** Lift the bar off the rack with assistance if necessary, ensuring it's directly above your chest.\n* **Lower the bar:** Slowly lower the bar to your chest, keeping your elbows slightly tucked in (around a 45-degree angle).\n* **Press the bar:** Push the bar back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully but avoiding locking your elbows.\n* **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower the bar, and exhale as you press it back up.\n* **Control:** Maintain control of the weight throughout the entire movement. Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest.\n\nThe bench press is a compound exercise primarily targeting the pectoralis major (chest muscles), as well as the anterior deltoids (front shoulders) and triceps brachii.  Proper form is crucial to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
