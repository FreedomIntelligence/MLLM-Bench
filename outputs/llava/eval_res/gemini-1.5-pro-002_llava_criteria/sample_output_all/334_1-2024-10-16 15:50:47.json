    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet has significant damage at the cone, where the shaft meets the handle.  The wooden/graphite layers underneath the grip are splintered and exposed.  This is a serious structural break and affects the racquet's integrity and playability.\n\nUnfortunately, this type of damage is **not easily repairable at home and likely warrants replacement.**  Here's why and what limited options exist:\n\n* **Structural Integrity:** The cone is a critical stress point.  Any DIY repair is unlikely to restore the original strength and could lead to further breakage, potentially causing injury.\n* **Material Complexity:**  Modern racquets use composite materials.  Properly repairing them requires specialized tools and knowledge.\n* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  The cost of professional repair (if even possible) might exceed the value of the racquet, especially if it's not a high-end model.\n\n**Limited Repair Options (Not Recommended unless for sentimental value):**\n\n* **Wood Glue and Clamp:**  If the break is relatively clean, you *could* try using strong wood glue and clamping the splintered pieces together tightly.  However, this is a temporary fix at best and won't restore full strength.  It's highly unlikely to hold up to regular play.\n* **Heat Shrink Tubing:** After gluing, you could try applying heat shrink tubing over the damaged area for added support. This is also a temporary and largely cosmetic fix.\n\n**Best Course of Action:**\n\n* **Replace the Racquet:** This is the safest and most practical solution.\n* **Consult a Professional:** If the racquet has sentimental value or is a high-end model, you could consult a racquet specialist or stringer. They might be able to offer more advanced repair options, but be prepared for the possibility that it's not repairable.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
