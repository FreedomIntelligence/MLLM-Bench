    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the endoscopy image of the stomach, describe the image in detail and identify anomalies visible in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts an endoscopy of a stomach, revealing the pink and red interior of the gastrointestinal tract. The lining of the stomach appears swollen, with a large hole or hollow area in the middle. The hole, filled with small pink and red granules, suggests the presence of gastritis. The granules are also scattered throughout the stomach, both inside and outside the hollow space, further indicating inflammation. This scene suggests an ongoing condition like the stomach disease erosive gastritis, which can lead to complications if not properly managed.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe endoscopy image shows the interior lining of the stomach. The surface is markedly irregular, displaying a cobblestone-like appearance with numerous raised, edematous (swollen) folds and nodules. The tissue appears erythematous (reddened) with areas of what seems to be superficial vascularity or possibly small erosions.  There is also a clear or whitish fluid/mucus visible throughout the image, likely a combination of gastric secretions and possibly the rinsing solution used during the procedure.\n\nThe anomalies visible suggest a significant inflammatory process affecting the stomach lining.  The cobblestoning, edema, and erythema are highly suggestive of gastritis, possibly severe.  The specific type of gastritis (e.g., erosive, non-erosive, autoimmune) cannot be definitively diagnosed from this image alone.  Further investigation, including biopsies and possibly other tests, would be necessary to determine the underlying cause and specific diagnosis.  The presence of erosions, though not clearly visible in this image, would indicate a more severe form of gastritis.\n\n**Important Note:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. This analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a diagnosis.  A qualified medical professional must interpret endoscopic images and provide appropriate medical advice.  If you have concerns about your health, please consult a doctor.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any visible anomalies in the stomach lining, such as abnormal growths or coloration.\n2. Describe the overall condition of the stomach mucosa, including texture and vascular pattern.\n3. Mention the presence of any normal anatomical structures, such as gastric folds.",
