    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIn a setting where a group gathers to witness a signing event, what might be the underlying social connections that bring them together for this occasion?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image depicts the signing of a bill into law by then-President Donald Trump. The social connections bringing this group together are primarily **political and professional**.  Specifically:\n\n* **Family:** Some attendees are family members of the President, demonstrating a personal connection to the event.\n* **Executive Branch:**  Members of the President's administration and staff are present as part of their official duties.\n* **Legislative Branch:**  Members of Congress (both Republican and Democrat) are present, reflecting their role in the legislative process that led to the bill's passage.  This includes leadership figures.\n* **Political Allies and Supporters:**  Individuals who supported the bill or the President's agenda may be present to witness the signing.  This could include lobbyists, advisors, or other influential figures.\n* **Media:** While not clearly visible in this specific crop, media representatives are typically present at such events to document the proceedings for public dissemination.\n\nWhile there might be some pre-existing personal friendships among individuals in the room, the primary reason for their gathering is the official act of signing the bill, dictated by their respective roles and affiliations within the political system.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe group gathered around the president as he signs a document may have strong connections or represent various interests that are affected by the decision being made. These connections can include social, professional, or institutional ties, such as political affiliations, business partnerships, or memberships in specific organizations. In the context of the image, the people watching the signing might be part of the administration, members of the public, or representatives of industries or organizations that will be directly impacted by the decision made by the president. The gathering could also be an opportunity for networking and building relationships, as well as learning about and discussing the decision directly with the person making it.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional roles and political affiliations of individuals.\n2. Suggest family relationships or personal connections among attendees.",
