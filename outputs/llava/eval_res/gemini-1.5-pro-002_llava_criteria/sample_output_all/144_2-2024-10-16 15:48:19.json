    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify potential humorous elements within the image, and create a humorous caption for the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Humorous Elements:**\n\n* **Juxtaposition:** A grown man with a backpack riding a scooter, typically associated with children, creates a humorous contrast.\n* **Motion Blur:** The blurred background exaggerates the speed, making it seem like he's putting in a Herculean effort for a relatively slow mode of transportation.\n* **Serious Expression:** His focused expression adds to the humor, as if he's in a high-stakes race.\n\n**Humorous Captions:**\n\n* \"When you're late for your meeting and your Tesla's in the shop.\"\n* \"Living my best life, one scooter push at a time.\"\n* \"My Uber driver cancelled, so...\"\n* \"Scootin' to the top, baby! (of the slightly inclined driveway)\"\n* \"Nailed the landing... eventually.\"\n* \"Just out here reliving my childhood dreams.  At 35.\"\n* \"Gas prices got me like...\"\n* \"Extreme scootering.  Don't try this at home.  Or anywhere, really.\"\n* \"He's too dangerous to be left alive!\"\n* \"When you said 'take the scooter,' I didn't realize you meant THIS scooter.\"\n\n\nChoose the caption that you find the funniest!  They all play on the inherent absurdity of the situation.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humorous element in the image is the man with a backpack on his back seemingly having trouble balancing on the small scooter. Riding a scooter could be challenging, especially if the man is not used to it. The fact that the man is wearing a backpack might also add a playful element to the scene, as he rides quickly down the street, possibly struggling to maintain his balance.\n\nA humorous caption for this image could be: \"The man with the backpack races to catch the bus, but the scooter might not be fast enough to keep up with his schedule.\"\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes a humorous take on the adult riding a child's scooter.\n2. Humor relates to the contrast between the rider's intense expression and the playful activity.\n3. Caption is creative, contextually relevant to the image, and evokes amusement.",
