    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed caption that describes not just the visual elements of the image but also suggests the geographical setting and possible climatic conditions present in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a calm blue stream of water reflecting a majestic, snow-covered mountain peak. The scene appears to be set in a picturesque valley surrounded by tall trees and with a lush green field nearby. The presence of snow on the peak suggests colder climatic conditions at higher elevations. The tranquil atmosphere in the valley, the reflection of the mountain on the still water, and the stunning natural backdrop of the snowy peak create an idyllic and serene landscape.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe crisp air of a high-altitude valley in the Himalayas, likely somewhere in Tibet or Sichuan, China, is palpable in this image. A pristine stream, partially frozen in delicate patterns of ice, meanders through a flat expanse of tawny grassland. The valley floor is flanked by slopes covered with dark conifers, their growth stunted by the harsh conditions.  Dominating the scene is a majestic snow-capped peak, its sharp, pyramidal form reflected perfectly in the still water of the stream. The deep blue of the sky, punctuated by wispy white clouds, suggests a cold, clear day.  The presence of a person in the bottom left corner, seemingly taking a picture, emphasizes the scale of the landscape and hints at the awe-inspiring beauty of this remote, mountainous region. The snow on the surrounding peaks and the frozen patches in the river indicate that the temperature is likely below freezing, even in the sunlight. The dry, yellowed grass suggests the area experiences a distinct dry season, likely during the winter months.  This scene captures the serene beauty and stark grandeur of the high-altitude Himalayan landscape.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption identifies mountain, river, vegetation, and any man-made structures.\n2. Caption suggests geographical setting (e.g., mountain range, region).\n3. Caption infers climatic conditions (e.g., cold, temperate, alpine).",
