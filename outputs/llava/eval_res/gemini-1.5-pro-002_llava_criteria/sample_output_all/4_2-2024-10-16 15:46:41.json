    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows an AV Access branded device, likely a docking station or hub, sitting on top of an iPad.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the sockets on the AV Access device:\n\n* **Two USB-A Ports:** Standard USB ports for connecting peripherals like mice, keyboards, or flash drives. The symbol next to them indicates data transfer.\n* **One USB-C Port:**  A newer USB standard, likely for data transfer and potentially power delivery.  The symbol next to it also indicates data transfer.\n* **One HDMI Port:** For connecting to an external display like a monitor or TV. The symbol clearly depicts an HDMI connector.\n* **One 3.5mm Audio Jack:** A standard headphone/microphone jack.\n* **One SD Card Slot:** For reading and writing data to and from SD memory cards. The \"SD\" label confirms this.\n* **Power Button:**  Turns the device on and off. The standard power symbol identifies it.\n* **Two Indicator Lights:**  Their exact function isn't clear from the image, but they likely indicate power status and/or activity. One has a computer symbol and the other a circular symbol, possibly related to connectivity or a specific feature.\n\n\nThe iPad below serves as a surface in this image and isn't directly connected to the AV Access device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
