    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows two screenshots of the same game with different version. The bottom one is the later version of the game. Based on the renewal of the game shown in the image, analyze the possible aspects the next version of game will focus on.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe evolution from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas to Grand Theft Auto VI showcases a clear focus on enhanced realism and graphical fidelity.  Based on this progression, the next iteration might prioritize:\n\n* **Even more realistic graphics:**  Expect advancements in lighting, textures, character models, and environmental detail, potentially pushing the boundaries of current-gen hardware.  Ray tracing and other advanced rendering techniques could become more prevalent.\n* **Improved character animation and performance:**  GTA VI already shows more nuanced facial expressions and body language. Future versions might incorporate even more sophisticated motion capture and animation technology, leading to more believable and immersive character interactions.\n* **Deeper narrative and character development:**  While GTA has always had engaging stories, future games could focus on more complex characters with richer backstories and motivations.  Player choices could have a more significant impact on the narrative.\n* **Enhanced open-world interaction:**  The environment could become more dynamic and interactive, with more opportunities for player agency and emergent gameplay.  This could involve more realistic physics, destructible environments, and more complex AI systems governing NPCs.\n* **Refined gameplay mechanics:**  Driving, shooting, and other core gameplay elements could be further refined and polished.  New mechanics related to character customization, social interaction, or online gameplay could also be introduced.\n* **Expansion of online features:**  GTA Online has been incredibly successful. Future installments might feature even more elaborate online worlds with new game modes, activities, and customization options.  Integration with social media or streaming platforms could also be explored.\n\n\nIt's important to note that these are just educated guesses based on the observed trend.  The actual direction of future GTA games could differ depending on technological advancements, creative decisions, and market trends.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image presenting two different versions of the same game, the later version likely focuses on advanced features and improved graphics. Some possible aspects that the next version of the game might consider include:\n\n1. Improved character models and animations: Enhanced visuals and realism for the game's characters to make the gameplay more immersive and engaging.\n2. Enhanced physics and collision detection: Advanced systems for in-game environments and interactions, such as better collision detection for vehicles, character movements, and objects.\n3. Updated multiplayer features: Enhanced support for online multiplayer, including new modes, additional features, and better matchmaking capabilities.\n4. Expanded storyline and missions: A more comprehensive narrative and a wider variety of missions and objectives to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience.\n5. Variety of environments and terrains: The inclusion of diverse landscapes, urban settings, and outdoor terrains, creating a more realistic and dynamic gaming world.\n6. Improved sound and music systems: High-quality audio for the game, including better voice acting, sound effects, and a richer soundtrack to enhance the overall experience.\n7. Additional customization options: More options for character customization, such as clothing, accessories, and more realistic facial features and hair.\n8. Enhanced AI and challenging enemies: Advanced AI systems for enemies to make them more challenging and responsive during gameplay, making the overall experience more engaging.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify graphics improvements, character design changes, and environmental upgrades between versions.\n2. Predict enhancements in realism, detail, or interactivity for the next version.\n3. Suggest possible gameplay or story progression based on visual evolution.",
