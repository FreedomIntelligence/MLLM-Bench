    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the event in the image and classify the cultural significance of event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays a bullfighting event where a man is holding a pink cape, and another man is holding a red cloth. Bullfighting is a traditional spectacle that originated in Spain and later spread to other countries. It primarily involves a matador handling a bull using a cape and a sword. The event has cultural significance as it often represents courage, strength, and skill on the part of the matador. The specific colors of the cape (pink) and the cloth (red) in the image add to the visual appeal and symbolism of this traditional spectacle.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe event depicted is a **bullfight**.  Specifically, it appears to be a stage of the fight where the bull is being weakened and enraged with capes and banderillas (the barbed sticks seen hanging from the bull's back).\n\nCulturally, bullfighting is a complex and controversial tradition, particularly associated with **Spain, Portugal, and parts of Latin America**.  \n\n* **Tradition and spectacle:**  It is seen by some as a deeply rooted cultural tradition, an art form with a rich history, and a thrilling spectacle.  It is often associated with concepts of bravery, skill, and ritual.\n* **Animal cruelty:**  Conversely, many view bullfighting as a cruel and barbaric practice, objecting to the suffering inflicted on the bull.  Animal rights organizations actively campaign against it.\n* **Debate and change:**  The cultural significance of bullfighting is actively debated.  In some regions, its popularity is declining, and there are increasing legal restrictions and bans on the practice.  Other areas maintain strong support for it as a cultural heritage.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as bullfighting and mention its cultural significance.\n2. Describe the scene accurately, including attire, personnel and actions.",
