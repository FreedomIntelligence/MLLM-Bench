    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the swimming stroke being used by examining the position of the swimmer's hands and head.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the swimmer is in the process of taking a stroke while swimming in the water. He is wearing glasses and a white cap. His left arm is extended, and his head is positioned to the side, which suggests that he is using a breaststroke technique to swim. The breaststroke is a swimming stroke where swimmers use their arms and chest muscles to propel themselves through the water in a pattern resembling a breaststroke motion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe swimmer is performing the **butterfly** stroke.  The swimmer's arms are extended forward simultaneously, entering the water ahead of their head, and then pulling back through the water in a symmetrical motion. The head is briefly submerged between strokes as part of the undulating body movement characteristic of butterfly.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the swimmer's hands move simultaneously with wingspan-like motion (butterfly stroke).\n2. Confirm the swimmer's head position aligns with butterfly stroke technique (facing down).\n3. Evaluate the synchronicity of hand and head movement indicative of butterfly stroke.",
