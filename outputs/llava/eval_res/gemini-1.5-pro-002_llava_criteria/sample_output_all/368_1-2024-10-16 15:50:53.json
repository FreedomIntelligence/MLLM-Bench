    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\n Invent a conversation that could be occurring between two or more characters in the image. The dialogue should reveal their relationships and individual characters, as well as reflect the atmosphere of the setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a group of women is enjoying a casual gathering of drinks and food on the patio of a house. They are seated at a long dining table, engaging in conversation and laughter. As they sip wine and share food, the women discuss various topics, such as life events, friendship, and recent trends. Overall, the atmosphere seems relaxed and social, with a sense of camaraderie among the group.\n\nOne woman, who could be the hostess, is chatting animatedly with a close friend about their recent vacation. They reminisce about their shared experiences and laugh about the silly moments they encountered during their trip. Another woman, who may be a family member or relative of the hosts, chimes in and comments on the lovely ambiance of the backyard gathering. She shares a story about a similar event she once attended, and everyone eagerly listens and enjoys the tale. \n\nWith the backdrop of yellow balloons and the warm weather, the scene exudes a sense of joy and togetherness. The women seated together at the table, engaged in lively conversations, make for a captivating snapshot of friendship and celebration.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Woman 1 (in white vest, reaching for food):** Mmm, this potato salad is amazing, Lerato! You really outdid yourself.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato, in white top with braided hair):** Thanks, babe! It’s my grandma’s recipe. You know, the one I told you about?  She’d be so happy we’re all enjoying it.\n\n**Woman 3 (in white furry vest, sipping drink):**  Definitely a winner. So, how’s the wedding planning coming along, Lerato? Any bridezilla moments yet?\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato):**  Girl, don't even start!  Trying to find the right flowers is proving to be mission impossible. I swear, I've seen more shades of pink than I knew existed.\n\n**Woman 4 (with curly hair, back to camera):**  You'll find the perfect ones. Just breathe.  And remember, the most important thing is that you’re marrying the man of your dreams.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato):**  So true.  Speaking of which, he’s taking his groomsmen for a “golf weekend” next weekend.  Can you believe it?  A “golf weekend.”  More like a boys-gone-wild weekend, I’m sure.\n\n**Woman 3 (in white furry vest):**  Don’t worry about it.  We'll have our own girls-gone-mild weekend right here! Spa day, anyone?\n\n**Woman 1 (in white vest):**  I’m in!  We can even try to recreate this amazing spread. Though I doubt I can match Lerato’s potato salad skills.\n\n**Woman 2 (Lerato, laughing):**  Don’t worry, I’ll share the secret.  It's all about the love, you know?\n\n**Woman 4 (with curly hair):**  And the paprika.  Don't forget the paprika!\n\n**(All women laugh, the sound blending with the gentle breeze rustling through the banana leaves.)**\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Dialogue reflects a friendly or familial relationship and individual character traits.\n2. Conversation fits a casual, outdoor gathering atmosphere.\n3.
