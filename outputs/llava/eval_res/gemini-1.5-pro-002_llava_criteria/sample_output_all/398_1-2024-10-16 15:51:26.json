    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a series of figures in chronological order. What is the trend of change in the predicted graph? Explain the reasons for this trend of change.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph is that the waistline of the figures gradually increases from one figure to the next. This represents the accumulation of extra fat over time, which is a common concern in the context of obesity. The series of figures, each showing a person wearing blue shorts and a spaghetti-string top, are used to explain the consequences of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in obesity and its related health problems. This sequence is a visual representation of the potential health risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe predicted graph would show an upward trend, indicating an increase in body weight over time.  The figures progress from a fit and toned physique to an increasingly overweight and obese physique. This suggests a trend of weight gain.\n\nThe reasons for this trend could be:\n\n* **Calorie surplus:** Consuming more calories than are being burned through activity leads to weight gain.\n* **Unhealthy diet:** A diet high in processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats contributes to weight gain.\n* **Lack of exercise:**  Insufficient physical activity reduces calorie expenditure and can lead to weight gain.\n* **Metabolic changes:** As people age, their metabolism can slow down, making it easier to gain weight.\n* **Hormonal imbalances:** Certain hormonal conditions can contribute to weight gain.\n* **Genetic predisposition:** Some individuals may be genetically predisposed to gaining weight.\n* **Lifestyle changes:** Changes in work, family life, or other circumstances can lead to less healthy habits and weight gain.\n* **Medications:** Some medications can have weight gain as a side effect.\n\n\nIt's important to note that this is just a visual representation, and the actual rate of weight gain can vary greatly depending on individual factors.  The increasingly unhappy expressions on the figures' faces also suggest a decline in well-being associated with the weight gain.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer recognizes the trend of increasing body weight.\n2. Assess the explanation for the rising trend, relating to the figures' changes.\n3. Confirm the answer follows a chronological analysis of the figures.",
