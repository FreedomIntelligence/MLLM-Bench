    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a ginger tabby cat lounging on a light-colored tiled or paved surface. The cat's fur is a warm orange-brown, with darker tabby stripes visible along its back and sides. It's lying flat on its stomach, with its front paws tucked beneath it and its head resting low to the ground. The cat's expression is alert and calm, with its amber eyes looking directly at the camera.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor area next to a modern building. The building has large windows and a light-colored facade. A section of the building features a horizontal slatted screen or railing, possibly on a balcony or upper floor.  A dark gray, vertical post or pillar is partially visible in the foreground, right next to the cat. The ground where the cat is lying is a flat, textured surface, likely concrete or paving stones. The lighting suggests a sunny day, as the scene is brightly lit and the cat's fur appears warm from the sun.  There is a hint of greenery visible in the background, possibly trees or bushes, peeking out from behind the lower section of the building.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
