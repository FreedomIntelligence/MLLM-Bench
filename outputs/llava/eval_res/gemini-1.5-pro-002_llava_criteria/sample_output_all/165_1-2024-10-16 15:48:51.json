    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the details of the event promoted, and assess the effectiveness of the poster as a marketing tool for the movie.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe poster promotes the movie \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\" and features the main character, a massive blue creature, with the words \"Feel it in ARX.\" The movie is scheduled for release in 2019.\n\nAs a marketing tool, the poster is quite effective in generating excitement for the upcoming movie. By using a large, eye-catching image of the main character and a bold, capitalized message, the poster draws attention to the movie and creates a sense of anticipation for the viewers. The blend of a memorable character and the catchphrase \"Feel it in ARX\" can evoke curiosity and encourage conversation among fans and potential audiences, ultimately increasing the movie's visibility and interest.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe poster promotes the movie *Godzilla Minus One*.  It advertises:\n\n* **Release Date:** December 1st, 2023\n* **Early Access Fan Event:** November 29th, 2023\n* **4DX Experience:**  The prominent \"FEEL IT IN 4DX\" emphasizes the immersive, sensory experience offered by this specific theater format.\n\n**Effectiveness Assessment:**\n\n* **Visually Striking:** The poster uses a stark, high-contrast color scheme of teal, black, and white. Godzilla's dorsal fins are highlighted in teal, creating a visually arresting image that draws the eye. The splatter effect adds a sense of chaos and destruction, fitting the monster movie genre.\n* **Clear Messaging:** The title, dates, and 4DX branding are clear and easy to read. The tagline \"Feel it in 4DX\" directly communicates the unique selling proposition of this particular viewing experience.\n* **Creates Intrigue:** The poster shows only a partial view of Godzilla, shrouded in darkness and water, which builds anticipation and mystery.  It doesn't reveal too much, encouraging viewers to learn more.\n* **Targets Specific Audience:** The emphasis on 4DX directly targets moviegoers seeking a premium, immersive experience. This is a smart marketing strategy, as it highlights a key differentiator for the film.\n* **Limited Information:** While the poster effectively grabs attention, it could benefit from additional information, such as the film's rating (which is small at the bottom) or a brief tagline hinting at the plot. This could broaden its appeal beyond existing Godzilla fans.\n\n\nOverall, the poster is a strong marketing tool. It's visually compelling, clearly communicates key information, and effectively targets a specific audience.  Adding a bit more information about the film itself could further enhance its effectiveness.\n\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
