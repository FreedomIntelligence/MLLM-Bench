Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the answer to this expression?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe expression is:\n\n∫ 2x / (x+1)(x² + 1)² dx\n\nThis integral can be solved using partial fraction decomposition. Here's how:\n\n1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**\nWe want to decompose the integrand into simpler fractions.  The form will be:\n\n2x / (x+1)(x² + 1)² = A/(x+1) + (Bx+C)/(x²+1) + (Dx+E)/(x²+1)²\n\n2. **Solve for Coefficients:**\nMultiply both sides by (x+1)(x² + 1)² to clear the denominators:\n\n2x = A(x²+1)² + (Bx+C)(x+1)(x²+1) + (Dx+E)(x+1)\n\nNow, solve for A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done by strategically substituting values for x (like x = -1 to easily find A) and comparing coefficients of like terms (x⁴, x³, x², x, and constant terms).\n\nAfter solving, you'll find:\n* A = -1/2\n* B = 1/2\n* C = 1/2\n* D = 0\n* E = -1\n\n3. **Integrate the Decomposed Fractions:**\nNow, substitute the values of A, B, C, D, and E back into the decomposed form and integrate each term separately:\n\n∫ [-1/2(x+1)] + [(1/2)x + 1/2]/(x²+1) + [-1]/(x²+1)² dx\n\nEach of these integrals can be solved using known integration techniques:\n* ∫ -1/2(x+1) dx = -(1/2)ln|x+1|\n* ∫ [(1/2)x]/(x²+1) dx = (1/4)ln(x²+1)\n* ∫ (1/2)/(x²+1) dx = (1/2)arctan(x)\n* ∫ -1/(x²+1)² dx  This one requires a trigonometric substitution (x = tan(u)) and will result in -(1/2)(arctan(x) + x/(x²+1))\n\n4. **Combine and Simplify:**\nCombine the results of the individual integrals to get the final answer. After simplification, the final answer is:\n\n-(1/2)ln|x+1| + (1/4)ln(x²+1) - x/2(x²+1) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the integral is **-(1/2)ln|x+1| + (1/4)ln(x²+1) - x/2(x²+1) + C**.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe expression shown on the paper involves a calculation of the determinant for a 2x2 matrix, which requires a little more information to determine the answer definitively. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndet(A) = a\\_11 \\* a\\_22 - a\\_12 \\* a\\_21\n\nIn this case, it is not possible to provide the exact answer without the values of the elements of the 2x2 matrix. To find the determinant, you need to know the specific values of a\\_11, a\\_12, a\\_21, and a\\_22.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly solve the integral expression shown in the image.\n2. Matches answer: 2*(x - 1)/(4*x**2 + 4) - log(x + 1)/2 + log(x**2 + 1)/4.\n3. Explanation is mathematically sound and aligns with visual math reasoning.",
