    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe computer screen has significant damage, characterized by multiple cracks emanating from a central impact point near the top left corner. These cracks spread across a large portion of the screen, indicating a forceful impact.\n\nPossible repair options:\n\n1. **Professional Screen Replacement:** This is the most reliable and recommended solution.  A qualified technician will replace the entire damaged screen with a new one. This ensures proper functionality and visual clarity.  Contact the device manufacturer or a reputable third-party repair shop for this service.\n\n2. **DIY Screen Replacement:**  This is a more complex and risky option.  It requires technical skills, specific tools, and sourcing a compatible replacement screen.  There's a risk of further damaging the device if not done correctly. Online tutorials and guides can assist with this process, but proceed with caution.\n\n3. **Screen Repair Kits (for minor cracks):** For very small, hairline cracks, some DIY repair kits claim to fill and seal the damage. These are generally less effective for extensive damage like in the image and may only be a temporary fix.  The cracks may still be visible, and the touch functionality could be affected.\n\n4. **External Monitor:** If the device is still functional despite the cracked screen, connecting it to an external monitor can provide a usable display while you decide on a permanent repair or replacement. This is a good temporary solution.\n\n5. **Insurance Claim (if applicable):** If the damage is covered by an insurance policy (e.g., accidental damage protection), filing a claim can help cover the repair or replacement costs.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the extent of the damage, professional screen replacement is the best course of action for a long-term solution.  Other options are temporary fixes or carry a higher risk of further damage.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the extent and location of the screen damage.\n2. Suggest realistic repair methods for the identified damage.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the instruction's focus on evaluation and repair.",
