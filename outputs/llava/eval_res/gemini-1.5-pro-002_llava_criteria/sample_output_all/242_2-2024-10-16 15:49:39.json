    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the different attributes of these two types of shoes and describe how these different attributes realize the specific functions of shoes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe two shoes have distinct attributes reflecting their different intended functions:\n\n**Black Nike Shoe (likely an Air Force 1 variant):**\n\n* **Attributes:** Leather upper, relatively flat and thick sole, high-top design, minimal visible cushioning.\n* **Function:**  This shoe is likely designed for casual wear and light activity. The leather upper provides durability and a classic look. The flat, thick sole offers some impact protection but prioritizes stability and a street-ready aesthetic. The high-top design provides ankle support, though not as much as a dedicated basketball shoe.  It's not ideal for running or intense sports due to the lack of advanced cushioning and flexibility.\n\n**White and Pink Athletic Shoe:**\n\n* **Attributes:** Breathable mesh upper, patterned and flexible sole with visible cushioning, lower cut around the ankle, lightweight construction.\n* **Function:** This shoe is designed for athletic activities, likely running or training. The mesh upper allows for ventilation and keeps the foot cool. The patterned and flexible sole provides traction and allows for a natural range of motion. The visible cushioning (likely EVA or a similar material) absorbs impact and provides comfort during dynamic movements. The lower cut around the ankle allows for greater ankle mobility, which is beneficial for running and agility training. The lightweight construction minimizes fatigue during exercise.\n\n\nIn summary, the black Nike shoe prioritizes style and durability for everyday use, while the white and pink athletic shoe prioritizes performance and comfort for dynamic activities.  The materials, sole design, and overall construction of each shoe reflect these different priorities.\n\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two shoes with different attributes on a tile floor. One is a black and white athletic shoe with laces, while the other is a pink and black Adidas athletic shoe with laces. These distinct attributes indicate varying purposes and functions of the shoes.\n\nThe black and white shoe is a nike shoe with white shoelaces, which suggests that it is designed for athletic activities like running or sports. Nike shoes are known for their performance, durability, and comfort. The black and white color scheme provides a neutral backdrop, making the shoes easy to match with various outfits and athletic gear.\n\nOn the other hand, the pink and black Adidas shoe is also designed for athletic activities and sports. Adidas shoes are recognized for their performance and style as well. The pink and black color scheme adds a stylish touch to the shoe, making it stand out from the black and white Nike shoe. This could be appealing to some individuals who enjoy expressing their personal style while engaging in sports or exercising.\n\nBoth shoes have laces, which are essential for securing the shoe to the wearer's foot, providing stability, and support during various activities. The laces can also be easily adjusted to fit the wearer's preferences or used to help maintain a snug fit and prevent the shoes from slipping.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify attributes (material, sole, shape, etc.) specific to the sneaker and skate shoe.\n2. Explain how each attribute contributes to the shoe's function (running, skating).",
