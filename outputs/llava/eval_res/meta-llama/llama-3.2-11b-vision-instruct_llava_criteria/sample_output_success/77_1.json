    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, classify the main activity occurring, and provide context for the setting, such as the likely location, time of day, and occasion for the gathering.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main activity in the image is a group of people sitting and watching a screen, likely projected onto a building, possibly at a sports event. They are sitting close to each other on the ground, which suggests a casual and outdoors setting. The people are engaged with the screen, and some of them are using cell phones, which indicates a current or ongoing event, such as a sports match or a public demonstration. The presence of a clock in the scene suggests that the gathering is taking place during the evening or night.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a large group of people gathered in front of a building, with a projector screen set up in the center. The scene appears to be a community event or gathering, possibly a movie night or outdoor screening.\n\nHere are some key observations from the image:\n\n* **Building:** The building in the background is modern and has a sleek design, with a large glass facade and a flat roof. It appears to be a public or community center.\n* **Projector Screen:** The projector screen is set up in the center of the gathering, suggesting that the event is focused on visual content, such as a movie or presentation.\n* **Crowd:** The crowd is diverse and appears to be made up of people of all ages. They are seated on the ground or on benches, and some are standing or walking around.\n* **Lighting:** The lighting in the image suggests that it is evening or nighttime, as the sky is dark and the building's lights are on.\n* **Location:** Based on the architecture and design of the building, it is likely that the event is taking place in a urban or suburban area, possibly in a city or town.\n\nOverall, the image suggests that the event is a casual and informal gathering, possibly a community event or a social gathering. The projector screen and seating arrangement suggest that the event is focused on visual content, and the diverse crowd suggests that it may be a popular and inclusive event.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the main activity: people gathered, watching a screen at an outdoor event.\n2. Describe the setting: likely a public space near a modern building, during evening or night.\n3. Mention the occasion: could be a community event, movie screening, or similar gathering.",
