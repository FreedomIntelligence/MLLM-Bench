    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the type of interaction between the bird and the flower, considering the potential benefits or harm to each party involved.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a hummingbird in mid-flight, hovering above a flower, suggesting a mutualistic interaction between the two species. The hummingbird is likely feeding on the nectar of the flower, while the flower benefits from the transfer of pollen from the hummingbird's beak to its reproductive organs. This interaction is an example of a symbiotic relationship, where both species benefit from each other's presence.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the bird is interacting with a flower by feeding on the flower's nectar. This type of interaction benefits both the bird and the flower. The bird receives a source of nutrition, such as energy or sustenance, while feeding on the nectar. The flower benefits as well, as the bird's visitation helps in pollination, which plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive cycle. The bird's movement from one flower to another may facilitate the transfer of pollen between different flowers of the same plant, promoting fertilization and ensuring the continuance of the plant's genetic diversity in the process.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify that the bird's action represents pollination.\n2. The benefit for the bird is nutritional, and the benefit for the flower lies in pollination.\n3. In this symbiotic relationship, the flower and the bird are not harmed by each other.",
