    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe graph shows the evolution of humans from ape-like creatures to modern humans. The trend is one of gradual change and adaptation, with each stage building on the previous one.\n\nTo predict the next stage, we can analyze the pattern of change:\n\n*   Each stage shows a slight improvement in physical appearance and abilities.\n*   The changes are gradual, with no sudden leaps or drastic transformations.\n*   The trend suggests that humans will continue to evolve and adapt to their environment, but at a slower pace than in the past.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is likely that the next stage will show further refinements in physical appearance and abilities, but with a focus on cognitive development and technological advancements. Humans may continue to evolve into more intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable species, but at a slower rate than in the past.\n\n**Answer:** More intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
