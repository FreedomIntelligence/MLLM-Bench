    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, interpret the thermometer reading and give some advice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a person is holding a thermometer with a reading of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is within the normal range for a healthy individual, typically considered as a mild fever. It suggests that the person may be experiencing some level of discomfort or discomfort due to the slight temperature increase.\n\nHowever, the temperature reading should not be taken as definitive or diagnostic, as personal thermometer readings can be influenced by factors such as time of day or ambient temperature. If the person continues to experience symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, or difficulty breathing, it is essential to see a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate treatment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe thermometer reading is 38 degrees Celsius. This temperature is considered high and may indicate a fever.\n\n**What to Do**\n\n* If you have a fever, it is essential to take action to bring your body temperature back to normal.\n* Drink plenty of fluids, such as water or clear broth, to help your body fight off the infection.\n* Rest and avoid strenuous activities to allow your body to recover.\n* Consider taking over-the-counter medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help reduce your fever and relieve any discomfort.\n* If your fever persists or worsens, seek medical attention to rule out any underlying conditions that may require medical treatment.\n\n**Remember**: It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're unsure about your symptoms or the severity of your fever, consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the thermometer shows 38.1 degrees Celsius.\n2. Evaluate the advice given for a fever of 38.1 degrees Celsius.\n3. Check for medical accuracy and relevance of the advice to the temperature.",
