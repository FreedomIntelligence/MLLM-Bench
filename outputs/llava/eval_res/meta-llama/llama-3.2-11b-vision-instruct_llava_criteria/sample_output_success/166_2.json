    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts the front page of a New York Post newspaper, with the headline \"NOT A SHRED OF DECENCY\" in large white text. The subheading, \"Anti-Israel activists rip down hostage posters in petty acts of hate,\" is written in smaller white text above the headline.\n\n* The headline \"NOT A SHRED OF DECENCY\" is prominently displayed in large white text.\n\t+ The use of all capital letters emphasizes the gravity of the situation.\n\t+ The bold font draws attention to the headline.\n* The subheading \"Anti-Israel activists rip down hostage posters in petty acts of hate\" is written in smaller white text above the headline.\n\t+ The subheading provides context for the headline, explaining the actions of the anti-Israel activists.\n\t+ The use of the word \"petty\" suggests that the actions are considered insignificant or unimportant.\n* A photo of two women, one holding a sign that says \"KIDNAPPED\", is shown on the front page.\n\t+ The photo appears to be a news image, capturing a moment from the event.\n\t+ The sign held by one of the women indicates that she is protesting or raising awareness about the kidnapping of hostages.\n\nThe image suggests that the New York Post is reporting on a controversial issue related to Israel and anti-Israel activists. The use of bold language and a prominent headline draws attention to the story, while the subheading provides additional context.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3. Assess relevance and accuracy of external knowledge used in explanation.",
