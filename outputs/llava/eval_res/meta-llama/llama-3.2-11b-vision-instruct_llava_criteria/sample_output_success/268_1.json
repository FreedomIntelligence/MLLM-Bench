    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe circuit board in the picture appears to be unusable due to the presence of a large amount of corrosion, which is visible as a greenish-yellow substance on the surface of the board. This corrosion is likely caused by moisture or humidity, which has seeped into the board and reacted with the metal components, causing them to degrade and fail.\n\nThe corrosion is particularly severe in areas where there are exposed metal contacts or connections, such as the pins and sockets on the board. In these areas, the corrosion has formed a thick, crusty layer that can short-circuit the components and prevent them from functioning properly.\n\nAdditionally, the corrosion may have also damaged the underlying insulation and dielectric materials, which can further exacerbate the problem. In some cases, the corrosion may have even penetrated the board's laminate layers, causing permanent damage to the circuitry.\n\nOverall, the presence of corrosion on the circuit board suggests that it has been exposed to an environment that is conducive to moisture and humidity, such as a damp or humid location. If left unchecked, the corrosion can continue to spread and cause further damage to the board, making it unusable.\n\nTo prevent this type of damage in the future, it is important to store electronic components and circuit boards in a dry, controlled environment. This can include using desiccants or humidity-absorbing materials to keep the air dry, and avoiding exposure to moisture or humidity whenever possible. Regular cleaning and inspection of the components and circuit boards can also help identify any signs of corrosion or damage early on, allowing for prompt action to be taken to prevent further deterioration.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
