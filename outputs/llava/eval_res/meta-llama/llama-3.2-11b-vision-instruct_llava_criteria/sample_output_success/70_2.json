    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, identify any cultural or traditional attire and elements present in the scene, and infer the type of ceremony or event taking place.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a solemn moment of a man presenting a bouquet of flowers to a woman, likely during a wedding ceremony. The man, dressed in a white shirt, holds a small bouquet of flowers in his hands, while the woman, adorned in a vibrant red and blue skirt with a silver top, stands opposite him.\n\nIn the background, two men are visible, one wearing a white shirt and the other wrapped in a red, blue, and yellow patterned robe. The setting appears to be a room with white walls and a wooden table, suggesting a formal or traditional venue for the ceremony.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of reverence and respect, as the man presents the flowers to the woman, possibly as a symbol of love and commitment. The traditional attire and elements present in the scene further reinforce the idea that this is a culturally significant event, likely a wedding or other important ritual.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are individuals dressed in traditional African attire, particularly a man wearing a kilt and a woman in a colorful dress. They are standing around a table, which indicates a formal event or ceremony. The presence of a cell phone on the table might suggest that the event is being documented or that the attendees are using it for communication. The group of people is engaged in a specific activity, and their attire suggests that the event is culturally or traditionally based.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify attire indicating a wedding; prioritize bright-colored, festive garments and any headpieces.\n2. Describe elements like bouquets or ceremonial objects that suggest a wedding.\n3. Identify the presence of a marriage officer or a religious leader holding a book that suggest a wedding.",
