    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nTaking into consideration the material of the shoes, which pair of shoes in the picture is best suited for long-distance running?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the picture, it appears that most of the shoes are casual or dress shoes, which are not designed for long-distance running. However, I notice that there is one pair of shoes in the top row, second from the left, that appears to be a sneaker. Sneakers are typically designed for athletic activities, including running, and may be a good choice for long-distance running.\n\nThat being said, it's important to note that the material of the shoes is not the only factor to consider when choosing shoes for long-distance running. Other factors such as cushioning, support, and traction are also important. Additionally, it's always a good idea to try on shoes before purchasing them to ensure a proper fit and to assess their comfort and performance.\n\nTherefore, while the sneaker in the top row, second from the left, may be a good choice for long-distance running, it's not the only consideration. It's always best to consult with a running shoe expert or do your own research to find the best shoes for your specific needs and preferences.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are several pairs of shoes stored on shelves in a room. A suitable pair of shoes for long-distance running would be a pair of running shoes, which can be identified by their lightweight, breathable, and cushioned design. The image does not provide enough information to determine the material of the shoes. However, it is likely that the shoes are made from materials like synthetic and mesh for the upper part and a cushioned, supportive, and durable sole with good traction for long-distance running. To find the best pair, it would be necessary to search specifically for running shoes among the stored shoes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify shoes that appear designed for running based on material and structure.\n2. Assess suitability for long-distance running, considering material durability and comfort.\n3. Exclude shoes clearly unsuitable for running (e.g., high heels, boots).",
