The dancer must also wear a heavy costume, including a headpiece, body suit, and tail, which can weigh up to 30 pounds.\n\nTo perform the lion dance, the dancer must have excellent balance, coordination, and timing. They must also be able to control their movements and maintain a steady pace, even when performing complex routines. The dancer must also be able to convey the emotions and spirit of the lion, which is often depicted as fierce and powerful.\n\nThe lion dance is an important part of Chinese culture and is often performed at special events such as weddings, festivals, and business openings. It is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and protection to those who watch it. The dance is also a way to honor ancestors and deities, and to celebrate the cycle of life and death.\n\nIn terms of the community's values, the lion dance reflects the importance of tradition, family, and community. It is a way for people to come together and celebrate their cultural heritage, and it is often performed by groups of people who work together to create the elaborate costumes and choreography. The dance also reflects the values of hard work, discipline, and perseverance, as the dancers must practice for many hours to perfect their skills.\n\nIn Chinese, the lion dance is known as \"shuāng lóng wǔ\" (双龙舞), which literally means \"double dragon dance.\" However, the term \"shuāng lóng\" actually refers to the two lions that are typically depicted in the dance, not dragons. The dance is also sometimes referred to as \"lóng wǔ\" (龙舞), which means \"lion dance.\"\n\nOverall, the lion dance is a vibrant and dynamic performance that showcases the beauty and richness of Chinese culture. It is a testament to the skill and creativity of the dancers, and it reflects the values of tradition, community, and hard work that are central to Chinese society.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
