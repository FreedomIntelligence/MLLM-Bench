    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich picture is of lower quality?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe picture on the left is of lower quality compared to the picture on the right.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image on the left is of lower quality. The pixels are larger and more noticeable, giving it a blocky appearance. The image on the right, on the other hand, has smaller pixels that are blended together seamlessly, creating a smoother and more detailed image. Overall, the image on the right appears to be of higher quality due to its finer resolution and lack of pixelation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the picture on the left as of lower quality.\n2. Assess clarity, sharpness, and presence of pixelation or blurriness.\n3. Confirm the left image has more visual artifacts than the right.",
