    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is a table, and you need to implement data visualization based on the data in the table, in order to present the data in the table in the best way.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the image features a table with a list of different states in India, one potential data visualization approach is to create a bar chart or a line graph that displays the population of each state over time. This can help showcase changes in population growth and trends across the states, and highlight any particularly fast-growing or slow-growing areas.\n\nTo implement this approach, you can use a data visualization tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a specialized data visualization application. Start by sorting the table by the population column or selecting the columns that show the population figures for each state. Then, create a bar chart or a line graph with the population data on the vertical axis and the state names on the horizontal axis.\n\nFurthermore, you can consider adding color-coding to the chart based on the state's region, such as North, South, East, or West, to make it easier to identify trends within specific geographic areas. Finally, you can add labels and legends to the chart for better clarity and understanding of the data. With these visualization techniques, you can effectively present the data in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe table presents a comprehensive overview of the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to states over the last six finance commissions. The data is organized into columns representing different time periods, including the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth finance commissions.\n\nTo visualize this data effectively, we can create a bar chart that displays the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state for each time period. The x-axis can represent the different states, while the y-axis represents the percentage share of union taxes and duties.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the data visualization:\n\n**Bar Chart: Percentage Share of Union Taxes and Duties Allocated to States**\n\n*   **X-axis:** List of states (e.g., Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc.)\n*   **Y-axis:** Percentage share of union taxes and duties (0-100%)\n*   **Bars:** Each state has multiple bars, one for each time period (tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth finance commissions)\n*   **Colors:** Use different colors to distinguish between the different time periods\n\nBy creating a bar chart with this structure, we can easily compare the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state across different time periods. This visualization will help us identify trends and patterns in the data, such as which states have consistently received a higher or lower percentage share of union taxes and duties over time.\n\n**Additional Visualizations:**\n\n*   **Line Graph:** Create a line graph to show the trend of percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state over time. This will help us see how the allocation has changed over the years.\n*   **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot to show the relationship between the percentage share of union taxes and duties allocated to each state and other relevant variables, such as the state's GDP or population.\n\nBy implementing these visualizations, we can effectively present the data in the table in a clear and concise manner, making it easier for viewers to understand and interpret the information.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Visualize data trends across Finance Commissions for multiple states.\n2. Highlight top three states with the highest percentage share changes.\n3. Ensure visualization clarity for comparison between states and years.",
