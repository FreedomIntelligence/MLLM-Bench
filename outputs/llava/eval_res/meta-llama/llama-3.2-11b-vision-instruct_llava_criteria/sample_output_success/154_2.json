    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a group of soldiers marching in unison, showcasing elements of discipline and ceremony. The soldiers are dressed in red tunics with black pants and tall black bearskin hats, exuding a sense of unity and professionalism. They carry rifles and swords, symbolizing their role as protectors and defenders of the realm. As they march, they maintain perfect alignment, their movements synchronized and precise, demonstrating their discipline and training. The presence of a flag bearer adds to the ceremonial atmosphere, representing the country or organization they serve. The crowd watching from behind the fence displays a mix of fascination and respect, acknowledging the soldiers' dedication and commitment to their duties. Overall, the image conveys a sense of pride, tradition, and national identity, highlighting the importance of discipline and ceremony in military protocol.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3.
