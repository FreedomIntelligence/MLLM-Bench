    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nI would like to fill the vacant space on the far right. Which block should I select? Please describe it's features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe block with a large white star should be selected to fill the vacant space on the far right. The star shape is a distinct feature of the block and can be easily recognized. The block is colored in primary colors, making it stand out on the white background, and it will add an additional element to the puzzle or play area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe vacant space on the far right of the box is a triangular hole. The block that would fit perfectly into this space is the orange block, which is shaped like a triangle. This block is one of the seven blocks that come with the toy and is designed to fit into the corresponding triangular hole on the box. The orange block is a sturdy, solid piece of wood that is painted orange, making it easy to distinguish from the other blocks. Its triangular shape allows it to fit snugly into the hole, providing a secure fit and preventing it from falling out. Overall, the orange block is a great choice for filling the vacant space on the far right of the box.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the block fitting the far right space; reference the yellow block on the far left.",
