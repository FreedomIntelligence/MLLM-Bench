    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Step 1: Analyze the postures involved in this activity.**\n\nThe image shows a person bent over, with their back slightly arched, and their hands grasping a long handle. This posture suggests that the person is engaged in an activity that requires manual labor and physical effort.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the tools involved in this activity.**\n\nThe image shows a long handle with a curved end, which is likely a tool used for digging or excavation. The curved end of the tool suggests that it is designed for breaking up hard soil or rock.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the profession based on the postures and tools involved in this activity.**\n\nBased on the postures and tools involved in this activity, it appears that the person is a miner or a construction worker who is engaged in digging or excavation work. The curved end of the tool and the bent posture suggest that the person is using the tool to break up hard soil or rock, which is a common task in mining and construction work.\n\n*Answer*: Miner\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
