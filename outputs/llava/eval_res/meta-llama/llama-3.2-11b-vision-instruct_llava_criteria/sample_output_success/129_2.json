    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the intensity of the emotion on a scale (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and justify the assessment based on visual cues.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a red, anthropomorphic character with an angry expression, characterized by furrowed eyebrows, open mouth, and clenched fists. The character's attire consists of a white shirt, brown pants, and a red tie with diagonal stripes. The overall appearance suggests a strong emotional state, likely anger or frustration, as indicated by the character's facial expression and body language.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe intensity of the emotion on this angry face can be assessed as severe. The visual cues indicating this level of intensity include the character's wide-opened eyes, furrowed brow, and tightly clenched teeth as they make a face of anger and frustration. The red color of the character's face also contributes to the intensity of the expression, as red is often associated with strong emotions or danger. Overall, these visual cues give the impression of a highly intense and severe emotional state.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the identified emotion matches the character's facial expression (e.g., angry, frustrated).\n2. Rate the intensity of the emotion as moderate, or severe.",
