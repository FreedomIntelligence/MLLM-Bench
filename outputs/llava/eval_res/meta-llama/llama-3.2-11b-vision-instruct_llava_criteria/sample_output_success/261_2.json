    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image depicts a scene of utter chaos with extensive damage visible throughout. Could you surmise which type of natural disaster has befallen this village?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a scene of utter chaos with extensive damage visible throughout. The destruction of buildings, debris scattered everywhere, and the turbulent water suggest that this village has been severely affected by a natural disaster, likely a hurricane or typhoon. The presence of palm trees suggests a tropical location, which is consistent with the type of storm that would cause such widespread damage. The image conveys a sense of devastation and destruction, highlighting the severity of the disaster's impact on the community.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image suggests that a major flood has taken place in the village. People are seen walking in the floodwaters, and the destruction appears to be extensive, with buildings surrounded by rough water, vehicles submerged, and debris scattered around. The force of the floodwater and the extent of the destruction indicate that this is a severe natural disaster, impacting the lives of the residents and the overall infrastructure of the village.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the natural disaster as a flood, based on water inundation and damage.\n2. Mention visible flood characteristics: fast-flowing water, debris, and affected buildings.",
