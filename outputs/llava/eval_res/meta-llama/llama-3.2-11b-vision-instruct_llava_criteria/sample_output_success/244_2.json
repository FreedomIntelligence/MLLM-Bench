    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the object in the bottom leftmost corner with the object in the top rightmost corner, and use a table to show their advantages and disadvantages considering their design, material, functionalities, etc.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Comparison of Wireless Headphones: Marshall Major IV vs. JBL Tour One**\n\n| **Product** | **Marshall Major IV** | **JBL Tour One** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Design** | Sleek, compact design with a focus on comfort | Premium design with a focus on style and durability |\n| **Material** | Premium leather and metal construction | Durable plastic and metal construction |\n| **Functionalities** | Active noise cancellation, long battery life, and customizable sound settings | Active noise cancellation, long battery life, and immersive sound quality |\n| **Advantages** | Comfortable fit, long battery life, and customizable sound settings | Premium design, durable construction, and immersive sound quality |\n| **Disadvantages** | No wireless charging, limited color options | No water resistance, higher price point |\n\nIn summary, the Marshall Major IV and JBL Tour One are both high-quality wireless headphones with advanced features and sleek designs. However, they cater to different needs and preferences. The Marshall Major IV is ideal for those who prioritize comfort and customization, while the JBL Tour One is perfect for those who value style and durability. Ultimately, the choice between these two products depends on individual preferences and priorities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the bottom leftmost corner is a pink pair of headphones, while the object in the top right corner is a white pair of headphones. The pink headphones are possibly designed for aesthetic purposes, while the white ones are more likely designed for a minimalist and sleek appearance. In terms of functionality, both headphones and headphones appear to provide similar features, such as stereo sound, but the white headphones could potentially offer better audio quality due to their sleek design and possibly improved materials.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* The pink headphones, likely designed for aesthetic purposes, could appeal to a wide range of users, especially those who prefer a colorful appearance.\n* Similarly, the white headphones' sleek design may appeal to users who prefer minimalistic and modern styles.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* The pink headphones, while visually appealing, might not offer the same level of durability or performance as the white headphones due to materials used in their construction.\n* The white headphones' sleek design could make them more prone to wear and damage, requiring extra caution in handling and usage.\n\nConsidering these factors, the choice between the pink and white headphones ultimately depends on the user's personal preferences, style, and requirements in terms of functionality and durability.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes a table comparing earbuds (bottom left) with headset (top right) on design, material, functionalities.\n2.
