    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the strong winds and dust in the air. The weather occurrence is a sandstorm, which is a type of weather phenomenon characterized by strong winds that pick up loose sand and dust particles from the ground, creating a massive cloud of airborne debris.\n\nThe people in the picture are likely nomads or travelers who are accustomed to living in arid or semi-arid regions where sandstorms are common. They are using traditional clothing and veils to protect themselves from the harsh conditions. The veils are likely made of lightweight, breathable materials such as cotton or silk, which help to filter out the dust and sand particles from the air.\n\nThe sandstorm is likely caused by a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. Strong winds: Sandstorms are often accompanied by strong winds, which pick up loose sand and dust particles from the ground and carry them through the air.\n2. Dry air: Sandstorms are more likely to occur in dry regions where the air is dry and there is little vegetation to hold the soil in place.\n3. Temperature fluctuations: Sandstorms can be triggered by sudden changes in temperature, such as a cold front moving into a warm region.\n4. Topography: Sandstorms can be influenced by the shape and elevation of the land, with valleys and low-lying areas being more prone to sandstorms.\n\nOverall, the people in the picture are taking necessary precautions to protect themselves from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
