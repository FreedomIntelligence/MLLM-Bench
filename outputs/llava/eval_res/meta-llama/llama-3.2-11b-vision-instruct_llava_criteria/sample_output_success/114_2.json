    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the expressions of the people in the picture and infer possible reasons for her expressions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTaylor Swift is smiling and appears to be happy. She is holding a MTV Video Music Award, which suggests that she has won an award and is celebrating her achievement. Her smile and the award in her hand indicate that she is feeling proud and accomplished, and her expression conveys a sense of joy and satisfaction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a shiny dress and smiling while holding a silver statue with a red ribbon around her neck. Another man is looking off into the distance, appearing to be in deep thought. The woman's expressions indicate that she is happy and proud, likely due to winning an award or receiving recognition. The man's expression, on the other hand, suggests that he may be lost in thought, contemplating the moment or the significance of the event. His expression might also be a reflection of the intensity or concentration required in his role or responsibility during the event.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the specific facial expression (e.g., happy, surprised) of the person.",
