    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCount the number of real horses in the figure.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a statue of a woman riding a chariot pulled by two horses. The woman is holding a spear in her right hand and appears to be in motion, with her hair flowing behind her. She is wearing a long robe that flows behind her as she moves.\n\nThe two horses are depicted in mid-gallop, their legs extended and their manes flowing in the wind. They are both facing to the right of the image, with their heads turned slightly towards the viewer.\n\nThe chariot itself is decorated with intricate carvings and has a large wheel on the left side. It is made of metal and has a dark brown color.\n\nIn the background, there is a blue sky with a few clouds scattered throughout. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of movement and energy, capturing the dynamic scene of the woman and her horses in action.\n\n*Answer*: 2\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are two real horses in the figure.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
