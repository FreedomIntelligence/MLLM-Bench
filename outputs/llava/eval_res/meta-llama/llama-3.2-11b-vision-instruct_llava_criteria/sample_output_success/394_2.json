    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend prediction image, determine the trend shown in the image is reasonable.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a humorous and exaggerated representation of the evolution of chickens over time, with a focus on their size and shape. The image is divided into two sections: the top section shows a series of images depicting the transformation of chickens from 1957 to 2025, while the bottom section features a dramatic scene where a Tyrannosaurus Rex is shown attacking a chicken.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Top Section:**\n\t+ Images of chickens from 1957 to 2025\n\t+ Each image shows a chicken with a distinct shape and size\n\t+ The chickens appear to be getting larger and more rounded over time\n* **Bottom Section:**\n\t+ A dramatic scene featuring a Tyrannosaurus Rex attacking a chicken\n\t+ The T-Rex is depicted as a massive, fierce predator\n\t+ The chicken is shown as a small, helpless creature\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n\nThe image suggests that chickens have been getting progressively larger and more rounded over time, with a notable increase in size between 1978 and 2025. This trend is likely intended to be humorous and exaggerated, rather than a serious observation about the evolution of chickens. The inclusion of the T-Rex scene adds a playful and absurd element to the image, highlighting the absurdity of comparing the size of modern chickens to those of prehistoric predators. Overall, the image is a lighthearted and entertaining representation of the evolution of chickens, rather than a serious scientific analysis.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the size of chickens over time. The image features a graph with several chicken sizes, including an oversized chicken, dinosaurs, and a rooster that has impregnated a dinosaur. The trend is presented in a humorous and exaggerated manner, showing chickens growing in size to become like dinosaurs.\n\nThe trend is likely a fantasy or a parody, as it is unrealistic for chickens to grow to the size of dinosaurs in actuality. The graph and the rooster impregnating a dinosaur are not scientifically plausible, and therefore, the trend is not reasonable. The image is meant to be humorous and entertaining, rather than providing accurate information about the growth of chickens over time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the answer identifies the trend as unreasonable.\n2. Assess the logical explanation for why the trend is unreasonable.\n3. Evaluate the consistency of the answer with the image's content.",
