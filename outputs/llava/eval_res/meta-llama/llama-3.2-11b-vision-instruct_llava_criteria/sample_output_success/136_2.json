    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe indoor space depicted in the image is an art gallery, characterized by its long, narrow layout and high ceilings. The walls are adorned with numerous paintings, creating a sense of grandeur and sophistication. The floor is made of polished wood, adding to the overall sense of elegance.\n\nThe architectural style of the space appears to be neoclassical, with its symmetrical layout and classical motifs. The use of natural light pouring in through the skylights above adds to the sense of openness and airiness, creating a welcoming atmosphere for visitors.\n\nThe cultural function of the space is clear: it is a museum dedicated to showcasing art and culture. The presence of paintings on the walls suggests that the space is intended for educational and aesthetic purposes, providing visitors with an opportunity to appreciate and learn about various forms of art.\n\nOverall, the indoor space depicted in the image is a beautiful and functional art gallery that embodies the principles of neoclassical architecture and serves as a cultural institution for the community.\n\n*Answer*: Neoclassical art gallery\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
