Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the equation, we can use the method mentioned in the image. This method involves combining the numerator and denominator into one fraction and then using cross multiplication for combining two fractions.\n\n**Step 1: Combine the Numerator and Denominator**\n\nThe given equation is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{x+1} + \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{x}{x-1}}$\n\nFirst, we need to combine the numerator and denominator into one fraction. We can do this by finding a common denominator for both fractions.\n\n**Step 2: Find a Common Denominator**\n\nThe common denominator for both fractions is $(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$\\frac{x(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})} + \\frac{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Equation**\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by combining the two fractions:\n\n$\\frac{x(1-\\frac{x}{x-1}) + (x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}$\n\nExpanding the numerator, we get:\n\n$\\frac{x - \\frac{x^2}{x-1} + x + 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{x-1}}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2x + 1}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})}$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify Further**\n\nWe can simplify the equation further by canceling out any common factors in the numerator and denominator:\n\n$\\frac{2x + 1}{(x+1)(1-\\frac{x}{x-1})} = \\frac{2x + 1}{(x+1)(\\frac{x-1-x}{x-1})}$\n\n$\\frac{2x + 1}{(x+1)(\\frac{-1}{x-1})}$\n\n$\\frac{2x + 1}{\\frac{-(x+1)}{x-1}}$\n\n$\\frac{2x + 1}{\\frac{x+1}{x-1}}$\n\n$\\frac{(2x + 1)(x-1)}{x+1}$\n\n$\\frac{2x^2 - 2x + x - 1}{x+1}$\n\n$\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{x+1}$\n\nTherefore, the simplified equation is $\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{x+1}$.\n\n*Answer*: $\\frac{2x^2 - x - 1}{x+1}$\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo simplify the equation, we can follow the steps of cross multiplication and use the distributive property.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two fractions with common numerators and denominators:\n\n(1/2) x (8/4) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can take the simplified equation to its next level by factoring the numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/2) = 2/4 = (1/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 - 1/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nThis means the equation is already simplified and there are no further steps to take. The final answer is 0.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3. Final answer should be mathematically equivalent to the original equation.",
