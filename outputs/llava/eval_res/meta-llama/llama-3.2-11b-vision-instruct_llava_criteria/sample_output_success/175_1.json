    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 675*900, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,900) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (675,0), where approximately would you place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\"?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in the image, we can consider the middle-left portion of the image, which is approximately at 0.15, 0.23. This placement would make the sign visible and accessible to the customers. The coordinates for this placement would be (0.25, 0.16, 0.45, 0.36), with the sign being slightly to the left of the center of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are approximately (272, 459). This is based on the relative position of the sign in the image, with the top left corner of the image at (0, 900) and the bottom right corner at (675, 0). The sign is located in the middle of the image, slightly to the right of center.\n\nTo determine the coordinates, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the x-coordinate: The sign is approximately 1/3 of the way from the left edge of the image to the right edge. To find the x-coordinate, we can multiply the width of the image (675) by 1/3 and add the result to the x-coordinate of the left edge (0). This gives us an x-coordinate of approximately 225.\n2. Calculate the y-coordinate: The sign is approximately 1/2 of the way from the bottom edge of the image to the top edge. To find the y-coordinate, we can multiply the height of the image (900) by 1/2 and add the result to the y-coordinate of the bottom edge (0). This gives us a y-coordinate of approximately 450.\n3. Adjust for the position of the sign: The sign is slightly to the right of center, so we need to adjust the x-coordinate accordingly. We can assume that the sign is about 1/4 of the way from the left edge to the center. To find the adjusted x-coordinate, we can multiply the width of the image (675) by 1/4 and add the result to the x-coordinate of the center (337.5). This gives us an adjusted x-coordinate of approximately 272.\n4. Adjust for the position of the sign: The sign is slightly above the center, so we need to adjust the y-coordinate accordingly. We can assume that the sign is about 1/4 of the way from the bottom edge to the top edge. To find the adjusted y-coordinate, we can multiply the height of the image (900) by 1/4 and add the result to the y-coordinate of the top edge (450). This gives us an adjusted y-coordinate of approximately 459.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" are approximately (272, 459).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Coordinates should approximate (450,600) for the \"Lemons 6 for $3\" sign.",
