    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and describe its usage.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the image is a projector, which is a device used to display images or videos onto a screen or wall. It works by projecting light through a lens onto a surface, creating a large-scale image.\n\nProjectors are commonly used in various settings, such as:\n\n* Home theaters: To watch movies or TV shows on a large screen.\n* Business presentations: To display slideshows, videos, or other visual aids during meetings or conferences.\n* Educational settings: To show educational content, such as videos or images, to students.\n* Gaming: To enhance gaming experiences by projecting high-definition graphics onto a large screen.\n\nIn this image, the projector appears to be mounted on a ceiling or wall, with a white cord hanging down from it. The projector itself has a rectangular shape with a lens in the center and vents on the sides for cooling. There are also several buttons and controls on the front of the projector, which allow users to adjust settings and operate the device.\n\nOverall, the projector in this image is likely being used for a presentation or educational purpose, given its placement and the presence of a screen or wall behind it.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a large lens, possibly the eyepiece of a projector, mounted on a ceiling. The lens is situated next to a fan, suggesting that it is likely connected to a projector unit, which is used for displaying images or videos onto a screen or surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a projector.\n2. Describe the projector's usage, such as displaying images or videos.",
