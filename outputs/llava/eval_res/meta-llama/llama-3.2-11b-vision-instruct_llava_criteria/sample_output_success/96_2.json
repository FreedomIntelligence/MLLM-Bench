    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork is a painting by Pablo Picasso, titled \"Girl with a Pipe\" (1925). It represents the Cubism art movement. The unique stylistic features of this painting are characterized by the use of geometric shapes, fragmented forms, and multiple viewpoints. The painting depicts a girl with a pipe, but her face is broken up into geometric shapes, and her body is fragmented into multiple planes. This style is typical of Cubism, which was pioneered by Picasso and Georges Braque.\n\nCubism was a revolutionary art movement that emerged in the early 20th century. It rejected traditional techniques of perspective and representation, instead emphasizing geometric forms and multiple viewpoints. The movement was characterized by its use of fragmented forms, overlapping planes, and multiple perspectives. Cubism was a major influence on modern art, and its techniques have been adopted by many artists.\n\nIn this painting, Picasso uses a range of colors, including blues, greens, and yellows, to create a sense of depth and texture. The brushstrokes are bold and expressive, adding to the overall sense of energy and movement. The painting is a classic example of Cubist art, and its unique stylistic features make it instantly recognizable as a work by Picasso.\n\n*Answer*: Cubism\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
