    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis image showcases a stunning wooden carving, likely crafted from a single piece of wood, featuring a symmetrical design with a flower-like shape at its center. The intricate patterns and textures are meticulously carved, with varying depths that create a sense of dimensionality. The carving appears to be made from a single piece of wood, with the grain visible in the background, adding to its natural beauty.\n\nThe carving's symmetrical design is characterized by a central flower-like shape, with curved petals radiating outwards from the center. The petals are composed of multiple layers of wood, with each layer slightly overlapping the one below it to create a sense of depth and dimensionality. The carving's texture is also noteworthy, with the wood grain visible in the background adding a sense of naturalness to the overall design.\n\nThe carving's intricate patterns and textures are further enhanced by the use of different wood tones, with the lighter-colored wood used for the central flower-like shape and the darker-colored wood used for the background. The contrast between the two tones creates a sense of visual interest and depth, drawing the viewer's eye to the center of the carving.\n\nOverall, this image presents a beautiful and intricate wooden carving that showcases the artist's skill and attention to detail. The symmetrical design, combined with the intricate patterns and textures, creates a visually striking piece that is sure to capture the viewer's attention.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wooden piece is carved into an intricate flower pattern, and it features a star shape in the center, giving the impression of a sunburst. The carving creates a layered textured surface on the wood, adding depth and visual interest. The design is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, with the flower petals following a regular pattern, yet the varying sizes and shapes of the petals make the overall design feel unique and dynamic. The combination of the carved flower and the starburst center make this piece a striking piece of artistry and craftsmanship.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Describe the intricate patterns, including shapes and lines, and their arrangement.\n2. Mention the depth and texture of the carved wood, indicating 3D effect or flatness.\n3. Identify symmetrical or asymmetrical elements, noting repetition or variance.",
