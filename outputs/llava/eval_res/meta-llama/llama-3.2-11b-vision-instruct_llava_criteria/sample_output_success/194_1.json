    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Step 1: Identify the different parts of the ECG waveform.**\n\nThe ECG waveform is divided into several parts:\n\n*   P wave: Represents atrial depolarization.\n*   QRS complex: Represents ventricular depolarization.\n*   T wave: Represents ventricular repolarization.\n*   PR interval: The time from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex.\n*   QT interval: The time from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave.\n\n**Step 2: Identify abnormalities in the image.**\n\nUpon examining the image, we can see that there are no significant abnormalities in the ECG waveform. The P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves appear normal, and there are no signs of arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions.\n\n**Answer:** The ECG waveform is normal, with no significant abnormalities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
