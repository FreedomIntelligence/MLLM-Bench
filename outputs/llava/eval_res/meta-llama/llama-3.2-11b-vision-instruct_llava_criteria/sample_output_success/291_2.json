    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of wear of the headset, and infer the possible cause of the wear.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headset in the image shows significant wear on the headband, with the leather padding being worn down and frayed. The ear cushions also appear to be worn out, with visible signs of use and wear. The overall condition of the headset suggests that it has been used extensively, possibly for long periods of time or in harsh environments.\n\nThe possible cause of this wear could be due to several factors:\n\n1. **Heavy use**: The headset may have been used for extended periods of time, leading to excessive wear and tear on the headband and ear cushions.\n2. **Poor maintenance**: Failure to properly clean and maintain the headset may have contributed to the wear and tear on the headband and ear cushions.\n3. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to extreme temperatures, humidity, or other environmental factors may have accelerated the wear and tear on the headset.\n4. **Quality of the headset**: The quality of the headset itself may be a contributing factor to the wear and tear. If the headset is made with low-quality materials or has a poor design, it may be more prone to wear and tear.\n\nOverall, the extent of wear on the headset suggests that it has been used extensively and may require replacement or repair to ensure optimal performance and comfort.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a person is holding a black headset with a fuzzy texture on the headband and ear pads. The headset appears to be worn down to the fabric, which indicates significant wear and tear. The possible cause of this wear could be regular use over a prolonged period, as headsets are often used daily by people engaged in activities such as gaming, listening to music, or participating in online meetings. The wear could also be a result of a lack of proper care, such as not regularly cleaning the headset or storing it in a dusty or poorly organized space. Overall, the headset's condition suggests that it has been used extensively and not well-maintained.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify wear on headset: peeling material, discoloration, deformation.\n2. Infer wear causes: usage, material quality, environmental factors.",
