    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere could be several possible relationships between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him, including:\n\n1. **Interview**: The person holding the pen could be an interviewer, and the other person is being interviewed. The interviewer is taking notes on the conversation.\n2. **Meeting**: The person holding the pen could be a meeting facilitator or note-taker, and the other person is a participant in the meeting.\n3. **Conversation**: The person holding the pen could be a listener, and the other person is speaking to them. The person holding the pen may be taking notes or remembering the conversation.\n4. **Teacher and student**: The person holding the pen could be a teacher, and the other person is a student. The teacher is taking notes on the student's work or discussion.\n5. **Colleagues**: The person holding the pen could be a colleague or coworker, and the other person is discussing a project or idea with them.\n6. **Counselor and client**: The person holding the pen could be a counselor or therapist, and the other person is a client seeking advice or guidance.\n7. **Writer and subject**: The person holding the pen could be a writer, and the other person is the subject of the writing. The writer is taking notes or interviewing the person for a story or article.\n\nThese are just a few possibilities, and there could be many other relationships between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the person holding the pen is likely the interviewer, while the person speaking to him is the interviewee. The interviewee is sitting in front of the interviewer, and the interviewer has a book open, which suggests that he might be taking notes or referring to some information during the conversation. The interaction between them takes place on a table, reinforcing the perception that this is a professional setting and an interview context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional relationship based on attire, setting, and body language.\n2. Assess dialogue cues suggesting hierarchy, cooperation, or advisory roles.",
