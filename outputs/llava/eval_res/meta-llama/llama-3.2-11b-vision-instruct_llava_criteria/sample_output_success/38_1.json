    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe badge in the image is a replica of the badge worn by Sheriff Andy Taylor in the classic TV show \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" The show is set in the fictional town of Mayberry, North Carolina, and the badge is a key part of the character's costume.\n\nTo determine the authenticity of the badge, we can compare its design elements with standard badges from the region. Here are some observations:\n\n* **Text font and arrangement:** The text on the badge reads \"SHERIFF\" in large letters, with \"MAYBERRY\" written below it in smaller letters. The font is serif, which was common for badges in the 1960s when the show was set. The arrangement of the text is also consistent with traditional badges from the region.\n* **Symbols:** The badge features a star shape with a five-pointed star in the center, surrounded by a border of small balls. This design is similar to traditional badges from the southern United States, particularly those from North Carolina.\n* **Material appearance:** The badge appears to be made of metal, possibly silver or gold-toned. The finish is smooth and shiny, which is consistent with the appearance of badges from the 1960s.\n\nOverall, based on these observations, it appears that the badge in the image is a well-crafted replica of the original badge worn by Sheriff Andy Taylor in \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" However, without further information or verification, it is impossible to say for certain whether the badge is authentic or not.\n\n*Answer*: Replica\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
