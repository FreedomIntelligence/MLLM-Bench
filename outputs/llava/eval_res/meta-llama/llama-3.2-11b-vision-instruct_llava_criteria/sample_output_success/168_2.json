    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe floor plan's design prioritizes privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas. The bedrooms are located in the corners of the house, which provides a sense of seclusion and privacy. The master bedroom is positioned on the left side of the floor plan, while the two other bedrooms are located on the right side. This layout allows each bedroom to have its own separate entrance and exit, minimizing the potential for noise and disruption from other rooms.\n\nIn terms of accessibility to communal areas, the floor plan is well-designed. The living room, dining room, and kitchen are all located in close proximity to each other, making it easy for family members to move between these spaces. The living room and dining room are separated by a doorway, which allows for a clear distinction between these two areas. The kitchen is located adjacent to the dining room, making it convenient for preparing meals and serving food.\n\nOverall, the floor plan's design prioritizes privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas, creating a functional and comfortable living space.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
