    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the test kit in the image used to detect? Interpret the meaning of the two lines on the test kit.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19, a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n**Interpreting the Test Results**\n\n* **Positive Result:** The presence of two lines on the test kit indicates a positive result, signifying the presence of COVID-19 antibodies in the individual's blood.\n* **Negative Result:** A single line on the test kit indicates a negative result, signifying the absence of COVID-19 antibodies in the individual's blood.\n\n**Understanding the Test Kit**\n\nThe test kit is a type of rapid antigen test (RAT) that detects the presence of COVID-19 antigens in an individual's saliva or nasal swab sample. The test kit works by using antibodies to bind to specific proteins on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe test kit in the image is used to detect COVID-19 and provides a quick and easy way to determine whether an individual has been infected with the virus. The presence of two lines on the test kit indicates a positive result, while a single line indicates a negative result.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe test kit in the image is a pregnancy test kit being held by a person. The two lines on the test kit indicate a positive result, which means that the person taking the test is pregnant. The presence of both lines, either red or pink, signifies that the pregnancy hormone, HCG, has been detected in the urine sample, and the person is expecting a child. The test was successful in determining the pregnancy status by observing the result of the two lines.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the test kit as for detecting COVID-19 antigens.\n2. Explain that two lines indicate a positive result for COVID-19.",
