    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe exercise depicted in the image is a bench press, specifically a flat bench press. This exercise targets the chest muscles (pectoralis major), as well as the anterior deltoids and triceps brachii.\n\n**Technical Essentials:**\n\n1. **Starting Position:** Lie on a flat bench with your feet planted firmly on the ground or on a platform. Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n2. **Lifting the Barbell:** Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Then, push the barbell upwards, extending your arms fully.\n3. **Control and Tempo:** Focus on controlling the movement throughout the entire range of motion. Aim for a slow and deliberate tempo, taking about 2-3 seconds to lower the barbell and 1-2 seconds to lift it back up.\n4. **Proper Form:** Maintain proper form throughout the exercise to avoid injury and maximize muscle engagement. Keep your core engaged, shoulders down, and back straight.\n\n**Variations:**\n\n* Incline bench press: Targets the upper chest muscles.\n* Decline bench press: Targets the lower chest muscles.\n* Dumbbell bench press: Uses dumbbells instead of a barbell, allowing for more range of motion and targeting different muscle groups.\n\n**Tips and Precautions:**\n\n* Warm up before starting the exercise to prevent injury and improve performance.\n* Use a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout the entire range of motion.\n* Avoid arching your back or using momentum to lift the weight.\n* Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets to allow for adequate recovery.\n\nBy following these technical essentials and tips, you can effectively perform the bench press exercise and achieve your fitness goals.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
