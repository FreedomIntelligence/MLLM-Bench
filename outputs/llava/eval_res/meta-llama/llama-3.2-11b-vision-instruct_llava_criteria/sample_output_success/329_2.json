    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a hand holding a small, rectangular device with a screen and buttons, accompanied by the text \"Love Playing Snake?\" in white font. The device has a yellow and white color scheme, with a black screen displaying a pixelated game of Snake.\n\n**Visual Quality:**\n\n* The image is well-lit, with a clear view of the device and its features.\n* The colors are vibrant and accurate, with no visible pixelation or distortion.\n* The text is legible and easy to read, with a clean and modern font.\n\n**Technical Quality:**\n\n* The image appears to be a product photo or advertisement, showcasing the device's design and features.\n* The lighting and composition are well-executed, with a clear focus on the device and its details.\n* The image does not appear to have any technical issues, such as noise, artifacts, or compression artifacts.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n* The image is of high quality, with good lighting, clear colors, and a well-composed shot.\n* The device is prominently displayed, and the text is easy to read.\n* The image effectively showcases the device's features and design, making it suitable for use in an advertisement or product showcase.\n\n**Rating:**\n\n* Visual Quality: 9/10\n* Technical Quality: 9/10\n* Overall Assessment: 9/10\n\nThis image is well-suited for use in an advertisement or product showcase, effectively highlighting the device's features and design.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3.
