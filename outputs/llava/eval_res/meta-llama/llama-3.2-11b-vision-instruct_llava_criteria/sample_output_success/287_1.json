    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBy integrating the expressions, actions, and attire of the characters in the image, could you please speculate on the likely age group to which they belong?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe group of people in the image are young, and they appear to be of high school age. They are dressed in caps and gowns, which are commonly attire for high school commencement ceremonies. Their actions, such as smiling, dancing, and celebrating, suggest that they are joyful about their accomplishments, further supporting the idea that they are young high school graduates.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image provided, the individuals depicted appear to be young adults, likely in their early to mid-twenties. The attire they are wearing, consisting of graduation caps and gowns, suggests that they are celebrating a significant milestone, such as a college or university graduation. The confetti and celebratory atmosphere further reinforce this conclusion.\n\nThe age range of the individuals in the image is difficult to determine with certainty, but based on their physical appearance and the context of the celebration, it is likely that they are in their early to mid-twenties. This age group is typical for individuals who have completed their undergraduate or graduate studies and are celebrating their academic achievements.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
