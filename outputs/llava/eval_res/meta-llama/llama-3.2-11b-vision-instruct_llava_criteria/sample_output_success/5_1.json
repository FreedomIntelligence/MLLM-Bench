    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and point out the difference between it and the general fan.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a portable space heater, often referred to as a small stove, sitting next to a black control panel. The heater has a circular fan next to it that can be used for direct heating of a small area. This is different from a general fan, as the heater is designed for providing warmth and comfort instead of just circulating air or cooling. The heater and the fan are both black and compact, making them suitable for personal use and travel. However, the heater is specifically designed for heating purposes and is not a general appliance like a regular fan.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a space heater, which is a type of heating device that is designed to warm a specific area or room. The main difference between this space heater and a general fan is that the space heater produces heat, while the general fan only circulates air.\n\nHere are some key differences between the two:\n\n* **Heat Production**: The space heater produces heat through electrical resistance, whereas the general fan does not produce heat and only circulates air.\n* **Temperature Control**: The space heater has temperature control settings, allowing users to adjust the heat output to their desired level. The general fan does not have temperature control settings.\n* **Air Circulation**: Both devices can circulate air, but the space heater's heat output is more focused and directed towards a specific area, whereas the general fan provides a more general airflow.\n* **Design and Size**: Space heaters are often designed to be compact and portable, making them easy to move around a room. General fans are also available in various sizes, but they are often larger and more bulky than space heaters.\n* **Energy Efficiency**: Space heaters are generally more energy-efficient than general fans because they use less energy to produce the same amount of heat. However, this depends on the specific model and usage patterns.\n\nOverall, while both devices can provide relief from cold temperatures, the space heater is specifically designed to produce heat, making it a better option for warming up a specific area or room.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a heater, not a fan.\n2. Note the heater's heat emission, contrasting with a fan's air circulation.",
