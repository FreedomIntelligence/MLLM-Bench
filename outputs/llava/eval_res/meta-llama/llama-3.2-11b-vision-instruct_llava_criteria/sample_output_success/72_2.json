    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer the activities that are likely to take place during the scene based on the objects present.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe scene depicts a serene and idyllic setting, with a picnic spread laid out on a white blanket. The presence of a book, a hat, and a bottle of wine suggests that the individuals in the scene are likely to be engaged in leisurely activities such as reading, socializing, and enjoying a meal together. The proximity to the water and the presence of a boat in the background further supports this interpretation, as it implies that the group may also be interested in water-based activities such as swimming or boating. Overall, the scene exudes a sense of relaxation and enjoyment, suggesting that the individuals are taking time to appreciate the beauty of nature and each other's company.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn this scene, a variety of items are laid out on a blanket at the beach, suggesting that a relaxing and leisurely outdoor activity is about to take place. There is a bottle of wine, likely to be enjoyed during a sunset picnic, and a book, which indicates that someone might be reading or unwinding on the beach. Additionally, there are oranges and sunflowers, which suggest that the person might be enjoying a healthy snack while soaking in the picturesque beach atmosphere. There is also a handbag in the scene, which could potentially belong to the person having the picnic. Overall, the setting appears to be a pleasant and serene environment for unwinding and enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the beach.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity 'picnic' based on the presence of a blanket, food items, and outdoor setting.\n2. Confirm objects like a book, sun hat, and beach bag support leisure activities.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the seaside environment suggesting relaxation or dining.",
