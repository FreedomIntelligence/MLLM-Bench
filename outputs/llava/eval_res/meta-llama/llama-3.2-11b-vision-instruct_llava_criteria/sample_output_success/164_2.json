    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven an image of an e-mail, determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe email is from Mike Johnson, a politician, and its primary intention is to inform the recipient about three urgent updates related to the Democratic Party. The updates are:\n\n1. Multiple special elections are taking place this month, with Democrats favored in at least one of them.\n2. Democrats are winning the fundraising race, having banked $44 million alone.\n3. The House Majority has a razor-thin majority, with only Joe Biden having full control and ramming through any radical policy he wants.\n\nThe tone of the email is urgent and emphasizes the importance of these updates for the recipient. The language used is formal and professional, suggesting that the email is intended for a political or advocacy audience. Overall, the primary intention of the email is to inform and engage the recipient in the political process, particularly regarding the Democratic Party's efforts and challenges.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe author's primary intention behind sending the email is likely to inform the recipient about three urgent updates, possibly related to politics or a specific event. The email includes a smiling man wearing a blue shirt, suggesting that the recipient might be familiar with the person or the situation described in the email. The presence of a flag in the image and the name \"Mike Johnson\" may provide additional context or information about the updates the recipient should be aware of.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the email's purpose is to inform, request action, or another intention.\n2. Assess how the email's content supports the identified primary intention.\n3. Determine the relevance of updates mentioned to the email's primary intention.",
