    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine their potential function.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a group of seven pens placed inside a clear cup. These pens come in various colors, making them a visually pleasing assortment. The collection of pens in the cup might be a part of a creative workspace, meant for individuals who need to write, draw, or take notes frequently. Such colorful pens can also be used for decorative purposes, adding a touch of color and fun to the environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe objects in the image appear to be candy sticks, specifically a type of candy called \"Fuller Candy\" that is commonly sold in bulk at stores like Bulk Candy Store. The colorful sticks are likely made of sugar or another sweetener and are coated in a hard candy shell. They may be flavored with fruit flavors or other sweet ingredients. The sticks are arranged in a bowl or container, suggesting that they are intended for individual consumption or sharing. The image could be used to showcase the variety of flavors and colors available in Fuller Candy, or to highlight the unique shape and design of the candy sticks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify objects as screwdrivers.\n2. Describe the potential function of screwdrivers (tightening/loosening screws).\n3. Mention the presence of multiple screwdrivers, noting variety if visible.",
