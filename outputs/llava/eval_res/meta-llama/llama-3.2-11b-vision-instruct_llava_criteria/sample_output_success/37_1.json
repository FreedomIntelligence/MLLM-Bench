    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDecompose the logo into its constituent parts and based on the elements, make an hypothesis on the type of team or organization it represents.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe logo features a shark with a scissor in its mouth. This unique combination could represent a business or organization that has a connection to the marine life (shark) and cutting-edge technology or precision (the scissor). One possible hypothesis is that the logo might represent a shark-related business, such as a diving or marine tours operator, or an aquarium or marine research facility. Alternatively, it could represent a business or organization that provides cutting-edge or precise services in an industry that is distinct from marine life, such as medical or beauty services.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe logo features a stylized shark with a menacing expression, its mouth open wide to reveal sharp teeth. The shark is depicted in a dynamic pose, with its body curved and its fins extended, conveying a sense of power and agility. The shark's eye is also prominent, giving the impression that it is focused on its prey.\n\nThe color scheme of the logo is predominantly blue and black, which may suggest a connection to the ocean or marine life. The use of these colors could also imply a sense of strength and resilience, as blue is often associated with trust and reliability, while black represents power and sophistication.\n\nOverall, the logo appears to be designed for a sports team or organization that values strength, agility, and determination. The shark's fierce expression and dynamic pose suggest a competitive and ambitious spirit, while the blue and black color scheme conveys a sense of professionalism and reliability.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all elements of the logo (e.g., shark, trident) and describe their visual characteristics.\n2. Hypothesize the type of team/organization (e.g., sports, marine) the logo represents based on elements.",
