    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nI've noticed a few stylishly fixable holes in my pants. Could you please advise me on the tools and materials required for repairing them in a fashionable manner?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo repair the holes in your pants in a fashionable manner, you will need the following tools and materials:\n\n1. A sharp pair of scissors: To make clean cuts when repairing the hole.\n2. White or beige fabric: For filling the hole, it is best to choose fabric that matches the color of your pants to make the repair less noticeable.\n3. A needle or embroidery needle: For sewing the fabric into the hole securely.\n4. Thread or embroidery floss: To stitch the fabric and create a strong, yet neat, repair.\n5. Sewing or embroidery hoop (optional): To hold the pants in place while sewing.\n\nTo fix the holes, follow these steps:\n1. Cut a piece of fabric slightly larger than the hole size. You can choose a contrasting or complementary color for an interesting and personalized touch.\n2. Sew the edges of the fabric, creating a tube-like structure.\n3. Gently insert the fabric through the hole in your pants, ensuring the edges are positioned correctly.\n4. Start sewing the fabric into the hole, gathering the edges as you go. Make sure to use a needle or embroidery needle with thread or floss suitable for the selected fabric. It's essential to maintain a neat and secure seam.\n5. Once the entire hole is filled, continue sewing the fabric to secure it in place.\n6. If necessary, use a sewing or embroidery hoop to hold the pants steady and make the sewing process easier.\n\nBy following these steps and using appropriate tools and materials, you can repair your pants' holes in a stylish and functional manner.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Required Tools and Materials:**\n\n• Matching thread (or contrasting thread for a visible repair)\n• Needle\n• Scissors\n• Fabric glue (optional)\n• Fabric patch or darning needle (optional)\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Assess the Holes**: Determine the size and location of the holes to decide on the repair method.\n2. **Thread Your Needle**: Use a matching thread color to blend with the fabric. For a visible repair, use a contrasting thread for a unique look.\n3. **Sew the Holes**: Bring the needle up through the fabric on one side of the hole, then insert it back into the fabric about 1/8 inch away. Pull the thread tight to create a small stitch. Repeat this process several times around the hole, moving the needle in a consistent direction (e.g., clockwise).\n4. **Reinforce the Stitches**: Once the hole is covered with stitches, go back and reinforce them by sewing over the same area in the opposite direction (e.g., counterclockwise).\n5. **Apply Fabric Glue (Optional)**: If desired, apply a small amount of fabric glue to the repaired area to secure the stitches and prevent further fraying.\n6. **Add a Fabric Patch (Optional)**: If the hole is large or in a stress-prone area, consider adding a fabric patch to provide extra reinforcement. Cut a patch from matching fabric, apply fabric glue to the back, and attach it to the repaired area.\n7. **Darn the Holes (Optional)**: Use a darning needle and yarn or thread to create a decorative repair. This technique involves weaving the yarn or thread in and out of the fabric to cover the hole.\n8. **Trim Excess Thread**: Once the repair is complete, trim the excess thread close to the fabric.\n9. **Inspect and Repeat**: Inspect the repair and repeat the process as needed to achieve the desired result.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n• Use a matching thread color to blend with the fabric, or a contrasting thread for a visible repair.\n• Add decorative stitches or patterns to the repaired area for a unique look.\n• Use a fabric patch to add extra reinforcement to the repair.\n• Consider using a darning needle and yarn or thread to create a decorative repair.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
