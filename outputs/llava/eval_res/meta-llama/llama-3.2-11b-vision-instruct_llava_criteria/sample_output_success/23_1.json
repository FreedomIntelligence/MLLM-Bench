    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the phase of the hunting sequence the eagle is in.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe eagle is in the phase where it is either preparing to catch its prey or has just captured it. In the image, the eagle is in flight and has its wings fanned out, which indicates that it is actively engaged in its hunting process. The eagle could be in the initial stage where it is scanning the surroundings, or it might be in the final stage where it has successfully grabbed its prey and is preparing to return to its nest or another safe location. Eagles typically have exceptional eyesight and precision, making them highly adept at capturing their prey during these flying sequences.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe eagle is in the final stage of a hunting sequence, known as the \"Dive Bomb\" or \"Stoop\" phase. This phase occurs when the eagle has spotted its prey and is preparing to strike. The eagle will tuck its wings and dive towards the water, using its speed and agility to catch the fish off guard. This phase is characterized by the eagle's distinctive \"V\" shape formation with its wings, which allows it to maintain control and stability during the dive. The eagle's talons are extended, ready to snatch the fish from the water as it emerges from the dive. This phase requires great skill and precision, as the eagle must time its dive perfectly to catch the fish without missing or injuring itself.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm eagle has caught prey, based on talon-prey contact and relative position.\n2. Describe the eagle's action, indicating the hunting sequence phase.",
