    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the landmark in the image and describe its historical and social meanings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe landmark in the image is the Statue of Liberty, which is a well-known and iconic representation of freedom and democracy in the United States. It is located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, New York City. Completed in 1886, the Statue of Liberty serves as an enduring symbol of the country's values and identity. The statue shows a woman holding a torch in one hand and an open book in the other, and is often referred to as \"Lady Liberty.\" The statue is not only an engineering marvel but also carries deep symbolic meanings, such as the welcoming of immigrants to the United States and the celebration of the country's ideals of freedom and equality. The image shows the statue against a cloudy sky, further emphasizing its historical and cultural significance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe landmark in the image is the Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical sculpture located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. The statue was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. It was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty has become an iconic symbol of freedom and democracy, representing the ideals of liberty and opportunity that are central to American values. The statue's pedestal is inscribed with the famous phrase \"Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" from Emma Lazarus' sonnet \"The New Colossus.\" This poem has become synonymous with the statue and reflects the idea that the United States is a beacon of hope for those seeking a better life.\n\nThe statue's design is also significant, as it represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. The statue's tablet is inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence, and the broken shackles and chains at her feet symbolize the abolition of slavery.\n\nOver time, the Statue of Liberty has become a powerful symbol of American identity and values, representing the country's commitment to freedom, justice, and equality. It has been the subject of numerous works of art, literature, and music, and continues to inspire people around the world.\n\nIn recent years, the statue has also become a symbol of resistance against discrimination and oppression, particularly for marginalized communities. In 2018, a group of activists climbed the statue's pedestal to protest the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border.\n\nOverall, the Statue of Liberty is a powerful and enduring symbol of American values and ideals, representing the country's commitment to freedom, justice, and equality. Its significance extends beyond its physical presence, as it continues to inspire people around the world to strive for a better future.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the landmark as the Statue of Liberty.\n2. Describe the historical significance of the landmark.\n3. Mention the social meanings or symbolism associated with the landmark.",
