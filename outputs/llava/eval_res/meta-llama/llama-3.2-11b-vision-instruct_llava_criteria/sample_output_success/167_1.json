    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo find the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point, follow the arrow on the floor plan that points to the exit. This arrow is located in the lower portion of the image, and it indicates the direction you should head in to reach the nearest emergency exit. Keep in mind that the arrow is pointing upwards, which suggests that you will need to move upwards on the floor to reach the exit.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo find the quickest route to the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point, we need to follow the green arrows on the map. \n\n1. **Start at the \"You Are Here\" point**: The red star indicates the starting point, which is located in room 226.\n2. **Follow the green arrows**: The first green arrow points to the left, indicating that we should move in that direction.\n3. **Continue following the green arrows**: As we move to the left, we will reach a hallway with rooms 219, 218, 217, 216, 215, 214, and 213. We should continue straight through this hallway.\n4. **Turn right**: At the end of the hallway, we will reach a staircase leading up to the second floor. We should turn right and go up the stairs.\n5. **Exit the building**: Once we reach the top of the stairs, we will find an emergency exit door marked with a green exit sign and a green arrow pointing outside. This is the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\n\nBy following these steps, we can quickly and safely reach the nearest emergency exit from the \"You Are Here\" point.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify the \"You Are Here\" point and the nearest emergency exit.\n2. Describe the path including turns and any landmarks (e.g., room numbers, staircases).\n3. Ensure the route is the quickest possible, avoiding detours or longer paths.",
