    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease identify and name each visible component of the watch mechanism, such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nInside the watch mechanism, we can see various components such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates. The gears are metal parts with teeth that help transfer power from one component to another. The jewels are usually made of a precious metal and are used to reduce friction between gears, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. The spring is a vital component that provides the power required to keep the watch running. Lastly, the plates are the main structural components of the watch movement, which help hold all the components together and guide their movements. These components work together to make the watch tick and keep accurate time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe visible components of the watch mechanism include:\n\n* Gears: These are the toothed wheels that transmit motion and power to other parts of the watch. The gears are typically made of metal and are designed to mesh together smoothly, allowing for efficient transmission of power.\n* Jewels: These are small, synthetic rubies or sapphires that are used to reduce friction between moving parts. They are typically located at the pivot points of the gears and are designed to withstand the high stresses and loads associated with watch movement.\n* Springs: These are flexible metal components that store energy and release it as the watch winds down. The springs are typically located near the balance wheel and are designed to provide a consistent release of energy over time.\n* Plates: These are flat, metal components that provide a base for the gears and other mechanical components. The plates are typically made of a durable metal alloy and are designed to withstand the stresses and loads associated with watch movement.\n\nOverall, the visible components of the watch mechanism work together to provide a reliable and accurate timekeeping system. The gears transmit power, the jewels reduce friction, the springs store energy, and the plates provide a base for the mechanism.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all visible components like gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n2. Accurately name each component based on watchmaking terminology.\n3. Ensure descriptions are clear and correspond to the specific parts in the image.",
