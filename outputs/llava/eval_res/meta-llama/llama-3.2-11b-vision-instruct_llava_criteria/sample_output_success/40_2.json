    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat type of mushroom is it in the image? Is it edible?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe mushroom in the image is a type of Psilocybe, which is a genus of fungi that contains psychoactive compounds. Psilocybe mushrooms are also known as \"magic mushrooms\" or \"shrooms.\" They are native to many parts of the world and have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and spiritual practices.\n\nPsilocybe mushrooms contain psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound that can cause changes in perception, thought, and mood. The effects of psilocybin can vary depending on the dose, individual tolerance, and other factors.\n\nWhile some people use psilocybe mushrooms recreationally, they can also be used therapeutically to treat mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it's important to note that psilocybe mushrooms are illegal in many countries and can have serious side effects if not used properly.\n\nIn terms of edibility, psilocybe mushrooms are not typically considered safe for human consumption. While they may not be toxic, they can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additionally, psilocybe mushrooms can interact with certain medications and worsen underlying health conditions.\n\nOverall, while psilocybe mushrooms may have potential therapeutic benefits, they should be approached with caution and under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. It's important to prioritize safety and well-being when exploring the use of any substance, including mushrooms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white mushrooms growing on top of a rock. It is not possible to definitively determine if these mushrooms are edible or not just based on the image. However, a proper identification could be done if more characteristics like the mushroom's shape, texture, and presence of any gills or pores were visible. Generally, it is advisable to avoid consuming wild mushrooms without proper identification due to the risk of consuming toxic or harmful species.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify mushroom as \"galerina marginata.\"\n2. State the mushroom is not edible.\n3. Ensure the answer is based on visual characteristics of the mushroom in the image.",
