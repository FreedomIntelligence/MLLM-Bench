    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat advice do you offer to the photographer of the image to improve image quality?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo improve image quality, the photographer should consider using a slower shutter speed and adjusting the aperture for a better depth of field. Since the image is described as a blur, it indicates that the shutter speed might have been too fast, causing motion blur in the crowd of people.\n\nBy decreasing the shutter speed, the photographer can capture more details within the scene, especially in fast-moving subjects like the woman walking. Additionally, adjusting the aperture can help in achieving a sharper image by allowing more light to enter the camera and allowing for a larger depth of field. This would result in a more balanced exposure, with both the foreground and background being more in focus.\n\nTo ensure they have these settings right, the photographer can also use a tripod to stabilize the camera and ensure a steady shot. Moreover, using continuous autofocus mode can help track the subject's movement and maintain focus throughout the scene, further enhancing the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is a photograph of a woman walking on a sidewalk, with other people in the background. The image is blurry and out of focus, which makes it difficult to discern details.\n\nTo improve image quality, the photographer could consider the following:\n\n1. **Use a faster shutter speed**: The slow shutter speed used in this image causes the motion blur effect, which can be distracting. A faster shutter speed would freeze the motion and result in a sharper image.\n2. **Use a lower ISO**: The high ISO used in this image contributes to the noise and graininess of the image. A lower ISO would produce a cleaner and more detailed image.\n3. **Use a wider aperture**: A wider aperture (smaller f-stop number) would allow more light into the camera and result in a brighter image. This would also help to reduce the effect of motion blur.\n4. **Stabilize the camera**: Camera shake can also contribute to motion blur. Using a tripod or a camera with image stabilization would help to reduce camera shake and produce a sharper image.\n5. **Use a higher resolution**: The image appears to be low-resolution, which can make it difficult to discern details. Using a higher resolution camera or increasing the resolution of the image would result in a more detailed and sharper image.\n6. **Pay attention to composition**: The composition of the image is not very interesting, with the woman walking in the center of the frame and the background being blurry and out of focus. Experimenting with different compositions, such as using a shallower depth of field or framing the subject in a more interesting way, could improve the overall quality of the image.\n\nBy following these tips, the photographer can improve the quality of the image and produce a sharper, more detailed, and more visually appealing photograph.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify main subject and suggest stabilization techniques to reduce motion blur.\n2. Recommend optimal shutter speed for capturing moving subjects clearly.\n3. Advise on composition to enhance visual interest and subject focus.",
