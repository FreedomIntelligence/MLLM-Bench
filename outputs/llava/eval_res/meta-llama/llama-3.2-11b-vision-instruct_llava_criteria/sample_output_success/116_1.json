    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman in the image is displaying a gesture of rejection or refusal, with her hand raised in a stop or no signal. Her facial expression suggests a sense of frustration or annoyance, with her eyebrows furrowed and her mouth set in a firm line.\n\nBased on her body language and facial expression, it is likely that the woman is feeling upset or irritated by something or someone. She may be trying to communicate her disapproval or refusal to someone or something, possibly in a situation where she feels pressured or forced into a decision.\n\nThe following are some possible contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion being expressed:\n\n1. **Conflict or disagreement**: The woman may be in a disagreement with someone, and her gesture is a way of saying \"no\" or \"stop\" to the other person's demands or requests.\n2. **Overwhelming situation**: The woman may be feeling overwhelmed by a situation or task, and her gesture is a way of expressing her frustration or feeling like she needs to take a step back.\n3. **Lack of control**: The woman may feel like she has no control over a situation or outcome, and her gesture is a way of expressing her powerlessness or frustration.\n4. **Disagreement with authority**: The woman may be disagreeing with someone in a position of authority, such as a boss or teacher, and her gesture is a way of expressing her dissent or refusal to comply.\n5. **Personal boundaries**: The woman may be trying to set boundaries or say no to someone who is pushing her to do something she doesn't want to do, and her gesture is a way of communicating her limits.\n\nOverall, the woman's gesture suggests that she is feeling strong emotions and is trying to communicate her needs or boundaries to someone or something.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
