    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image appears to be AI-generated. Here's why:\n\n1. **Unrealistic wave**: The wave depicted in the image is enormous, with a height that is not physically possible in the real world. Waves of this magnitude would be catastrophic and would likely cause widespread destruction.\n2. **Lack of context**: The image does not provide any context about the location or situation. There are no signs of coastal erosion, flooding, or other indicators that would suggest a real-life event.\n3. **Inconsistent lighting**: The lighting in the image is inconsistent, with the sky being overcast and dark, while the buildings and streets appear to be well-lit, suggesting artificial illumination.\n4. **Absence of human activity**: There is no visible human activity in the image, which is unusual given the scale of the wave and the potential for destruction.\n5. **Computer-generated details**: The image features computer-generated details, such as the wave's foam and spray, which are characteristic of AI-generated imagery.\n\nOverall, the image's unrealistic wave, lack of context, inconsistent lighting, absence of human activity, and computer-generated details suggest that it is likely AI-generated rather than a real photograph.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
