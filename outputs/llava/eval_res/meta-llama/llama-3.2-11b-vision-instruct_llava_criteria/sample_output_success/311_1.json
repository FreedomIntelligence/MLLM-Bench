    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnswer the question marks in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of math problems with the numbers 1 through 12, and some of them are missing. The missing numbers are represented by question marks. To answer the question, find the mathematical expression corresponding to each missing number based on the context of the problem.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image presents a series of mathematical equations, each involving geometric shapes such as circles, triangles, squares, and stars. The equations are designed to be solved by applying basic arithmetic operations and recognizing patterns.\n\n**Equation 1:**\nThe first equation reads \"+ = 8.\" To solve this, we need to find two numbers that add up to 8. Given the presence of a circle and a triangle, it is reasonable to assume that the two numbers are 3 (represented by the circle) and 5 (represented by the triangle), as 3 + 5 = 8.\n\n**Equation 2:**\nThe second equation is \"- = 4.\" Similar to the first equation, we need to find two numbers that subtract to 4. Considering the shapes involved, a plausible solution is 7 (represented by the circle) and 3 (represented by the triangle), as 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n**Equation 3:**\nThe third equation is \"+ = 12.\" To solve this, we must identify two numbers that add up to 12. Given the shapes, a possible solution is 6 (represented by the star) and 6 (represented by the square), as 6 + 6 = 12.\n\n**Equation 4:**\nThe fourth equation is \"- = ?.\" This equation involves a square and a star. To solve it, we need to find two numbers that subtract to the unknown value. A possible solution is 9 (represented by the square) and 3 (represented by the star), as 9 - 3 = 6.\n\n**Equation 5:**\nThe fifth equation is \"+ = ?.\" This equation involves a circle and a triangle. To solve it, we need to find two numbers that add up to the unknown value. A possible solution is 4 (represented by the circle) and 4 (represented by the triangle), as 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the given equations and applying basic arithmetic operations, we can determine the values for the question marks in the image.\n\n*Answer*: 6, 8\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the value of the star based on the given equations and reference.\n2. Accurately calculates the values of circle, square, and triangle using visual math reasoning.\n3. Answers are consistent with reference: star = 8, circle = 6, square = 4, triangle = 2.",
