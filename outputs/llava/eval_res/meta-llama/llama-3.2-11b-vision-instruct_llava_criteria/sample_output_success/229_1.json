    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the relationship between two birds in the image, what kind of natural relation do they show?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are two birds, one small and one large. They are perched together on a tree branch with the small bird having its mouth open and the larger bird leaning over to feed it. This scene demonstrates a nurturing relationship between the two birds, where the larger one is providing food and care for the smaller bird. This is a natural behavior observed in many bird species, particularly when parent birds feed their offspring or when one bird helps another in times of need. The fact that the larger bird is feeding the smaller bird signifies a bonding experience and cooperation between the two species.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a robin feeding its chick, illustrating a clear example of parental care. The robin is providing sustenance to the chick, which is a fundamental aspect of their relationship. This behavior is crucial for the chick's survival and development, as it relies on the robin for food and protection. The robin's actions demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility and nurturing towards its offspring, highlighting the importance of parental care in the natural world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify brood parasitism as the natural relationship depicted.",
