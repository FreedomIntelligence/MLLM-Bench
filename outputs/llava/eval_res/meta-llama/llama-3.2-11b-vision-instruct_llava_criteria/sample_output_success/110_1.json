    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts three individuals standing behind a desk, with the man in the center seated in a large, ornate chair. He is attired in a gold robe featuring blue designs, complemented by a black hat adorned with a gold tassel. The two men standing on either side of him wear blue and white robes, respectively, and also wear black hats with gold tassels.\n\nThe desk itself is crafted from light-colored wood and boasts intricate carvings of horses and a crescent moon. A large, yellow crescent moon with a yellow sun at its center serves as the backdrop for the scene, set against a dark brown wall. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests a formal or ceremonial setting, with the ornate chair and elaborate robes contributing to a sense of grandeur and importance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3.
