    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThrough the lens of primate behavior and communication, what might the facial expression and gaze of the gorilla in the image suggest about its current state or intentions?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Observation**\n\nThe gorilla in the image has a serious expression, with its eyes narrowed and its mouth slightly open. The gaze is fixed on something in the distance.\n\n**Behavioral Interpretation**\n\n*   **Aggression**: The gorilla's facial expression and gaze could suggest aggression or defensiveness. The narrowed eyes and open mouth may indicate that the gorilla is feeling threatened or preparing to defend itself.\n*   **Curiosity**: Alternatively, the gorilla's gaze could be a sign of curiosity. The fixed stare may indicate that the gorilla is interested in something in the distance and is trying to learn more about it.\n*   **Attention**: The gorilla's expression and gaze could also suggest attention. The focused stare may indicate that the gorilla is paying close attention to something or someone, possibly indicating that it is engaged in a social interaction or is trying to communicate with someone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the gorilla's facial expression and gaze, it is difficult to determine its current state or intentions with certainty. However, the narrowed eyes and open mouth could suggest aggression or defensiveness, while the fixed stare could indicate curiosity or attention.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the gorilla has a somewhat pensive expression on its face, looking upwards with its eyes wide open. This facial expression might suggest that the gorilla is experiencing curiosity, contemplation, or interest in something it sees in the distance. Given their typically gentle and intelligent nature, gorillas are known to exhibit various emotions and facial expressions, and this particular expression could be interpreted as the gorilla trying to understand its environment or engage with its surroundings. It is important to note that as a visual AI assistant, I can only provide descriptions of the gorilla's facial expression based on the available image data, and cannot accurately interpret emotions or intentions without more context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify specific facial features indicating emotion (e.g., eyes, mouth) related to primate behavior.\n",
