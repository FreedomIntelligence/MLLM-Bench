    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the function of the design of the tread in the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe tread in the picture is designed to provide traction and grip on various surfaces, particularly during running or other athletic activities. The deep grooves and lugs on the sole of the shoe work together to channel water away from the foot and distribute pressure evenly across the surface, allowing for better grip and stability.\n\nThe design of the tread also helps to reduce the risk of slipping or sliding on smooth or slippery surfaces. The raised edges of the lugs create a barrier between the foot and the ground, preventing the foot from sliding forward or backward. Additionally, the tread's pattern helps to dissipate impact forces, reducing the amount of stress placed on the foot and ankle.\n\nOverall, the design of the tread in the picture is intended to provide a secure and stable footing for the wearer, while also promoting comfort and reducing the risk of injury.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe design of the tread on the sole of the shoe in the image serves a specific purpose related to the footwear's function. The criss-cross pattern of the tread provides an enhanced grip and traction to the wearer while walking or running on various surfaces. This tread design helps prevent slipping and keeps the wearer's feet secured on the ground, reducing the risk of falls and injuries. Additionally, the tread contributes to the overall durability and longevity of the shoe, as the pattern helps to distribute the wear evenly and absorbs shock from each step taken.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tread pattern and describe its function for traction and stability.\n2. Mention material properties contributing to grip and durability.\n3. Explain tread design relevance to specific activities or conditions.",
