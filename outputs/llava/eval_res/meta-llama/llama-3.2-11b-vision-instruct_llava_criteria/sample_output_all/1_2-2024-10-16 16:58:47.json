Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the white objects in the image and determine their functionality.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe white objects in the image are small, ceramic or porcelain figurines of penguins. They are likely decorative items, possibly used as paperweights or desk ornaments. The penguins are arranged in a group on a table, with one black penguin standing out among them. The penguins have distinctive features such as orange beaks and feet, blue eyes, and red scarves. They appear to be hand-painted and have a glossy finish. The presence of the penguins on the table suggests that they may be part of a larger collection or display. Overall, the image showcases a charming and whimsical arrangement of penguin figurines, adding a touch of personality to the table setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white snowmen, or snowflakes, and other white objects, such as cups and vases, arranged on a wooden dining table. These objects are designed as decorative items for the table, adding an element of festivity and charm to the setting. The snowflakes and snowmen may be part of a theme or an aesthetic choice, while the cups and vases serve as functional items for holding beverages or displaying flowers, respectively. Overall, the main focus of the image is the creative and decorative arrangement of these white objects on the tabletop.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all white objects as 'tumbler toys' accurately.\n2. Describe the functionality of tumbler toys correctly.\n3. Exclude non-white objects and irrelevant background items.",
