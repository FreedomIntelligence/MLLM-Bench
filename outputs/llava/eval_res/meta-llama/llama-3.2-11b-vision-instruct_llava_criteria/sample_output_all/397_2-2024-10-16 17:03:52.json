Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Property to determine:** Capital Expenditure in 2023\n\n**Available data:**\n\n* Net income (loss) for 2020: $7,179,742\n* Interest expense for 2020: $757,336\n* Allowance for credit losses for 2020: $43,434\n* Depreciation and amortization for 2020: $651,523\n* Deferred income tax, net for 2020: Not available\n* Amortization of right-of-use assets for 2020: $148,945\n* Interest and investment gain, net for 2020: $469,486\n* Loss/gain on disposal of property and equipment for 2020: $24\n* Net income (loss) for 2021: $7,768,670\n* Interest expense for 2021: $1,231,002\n* Allowance for credit losses for 2021: $49,300\n* Depreciation and amortization for 2021: $1,495,380\n* Deferred income tax, net for 2021: Not available\n* Amortization of right-of-use assets for 2021: $348,863\n* Interest and investment gain, net for 2021: $146,972\n* Loss/gain on disposal of property and equipment for 2021: $258\n* Net income (loss) for 2022: $31,538,062\n* Interest expense for 2022: $51,655\n* Allowance for credit losses for 2022: $118,384\n* Depreciation and amortization for 2022: $2,224,169\n* Deferred income tax, net for 2022: Not available\n* Amortization of right-of-use assets for 2022: $510,915\n* Interest and investment gain, net for 2022: $606,447\n* Loss/gain on disposal of property and equipment for 2022: $10,697\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression, we need to analyze the relationship between the net income (loss) and the other financial metrics.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total capital expenditure for each year:\n\n* 2020: $7,179,742 + $757,336 + $43,434 + $651,523 + $148,945 + $469,486 + $24 = $9,050,830\n* 2021: $7,768,670 + $1,231,002 + $49,300 + $1,495,380 + $348,863 + $146,972 + $258 = $11,240,445\n* 2022: $31,538,062 + $51,655 + $118,384 + $2,224,169 + $510,915 + $606,447 + $10,697 = $35,060,229\n\nNext, we can calculate the average annual increase in capital expenditure:\n\n* 2021 - 2020: $11,240,445 - $9,050,830 = $2,189,615\n* 2022 - 2021: $35,060,229 - $11,240,445 = $23,819,784\n\nThe average annual increase is approximately $13,004,700.\n\nFinally, we can predict the capital expenditure for 2023 by adding the average annual increase to the capital expenditure in 2022:\n\n$35,060,229 + $13,004,700 = $48,064,929\n\nTherefore, the predicted capital expenditure for 2023 is approximately $48,064,929.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted value should be based on \"depreciation and amortization\" figures from 2020 to 2022.\n2. Answer must include a specific numerical prediction for 2023 capital expenditure.\n3. Prediction should be derived using linear regression on the provided data points.",
