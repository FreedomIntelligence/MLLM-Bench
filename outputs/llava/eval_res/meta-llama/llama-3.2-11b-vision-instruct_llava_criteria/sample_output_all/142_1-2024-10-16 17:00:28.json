    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain how the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit could be perceived as humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe addition of human-like accessories, such as sunglasses and a hat, to a pineapple can be perceived as humorous because it gives the fruit a quirky and amusing appearance. This unconventional combination of a fruit and human-like accessories can be seen as a playful statement and may evoke laughter or amusement in viewers. The image of the pineapple with sunglasses lying on a bed on a blanket adds to the lighthearted and comical nature of the scene, as it is an atypical, whimsical depiction of a commonly seen object.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe addition of human-like accessories to a fruit, such as sunglasses, can be perceived as humorous for several reasons:\n\n1. **Anthropomorphism**: Attributing human-like qualities to an inanimate object, like a fruit, creates a sense of incongruity and surprise. This unexpected twist on the typical characteristics of a fruit can elicit a chuckle.\n2. **Exaggerated human behavior**: Fruits are not typically associated with wearing sunglasses, which are often seen as a human fashion accessory. The juxtaposition of a fruit with sunglasses creates an absurd and comical image.\n3. **Playful subversion of expectations**: By dressing a fruit in human-like attire, the viewer's expectations are subverted, leading to a sense of surprise and amusement. This playful manipulation of expectations can create humor.\n4. **Lighthearted and whimsical tone**: The use of human-like accessories on a fruit implies a lighthearted and whimsical tone, which is often associated with humor. The image may evoke a feeling of playfulness and silliness.\n5. **Absurdity and incongruity**: The combination of a fruit with human-like accessories is absurd and incongruous, creating a sense of cognitive dissonance that can be humorous.\n\nOverall, the addition of human-like accessories to a fruit can be perceived as humorous due to the unexpected twist on traditional fruit characteristics, the playful subversion of expectations, and the lighthearted and whimsical tone it evokes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the accessory (sunglasses) and its typical human use.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing fruit by accessorizing.\n3. Discuss the incongruity between the pineapple and sunglasses.",
