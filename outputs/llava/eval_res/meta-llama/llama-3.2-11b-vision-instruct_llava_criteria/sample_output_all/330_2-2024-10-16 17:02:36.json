    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it appears that a natural disaster, such as a flood or landslide, has occurred. The damage to the structures and the presence of debris suggest that the disaster was intense and possibly long-lasting. The fact that the disaster has already been cleaned up and search and rescue teams are present indicates that the disaster is in the aftermath phase. However, I'm unable to determine the exact duration and intensity of the disaster based on this image alone. It's possible that the disaster occurred quickly, such as a landslide or flash flood, or it may have been a more prolonged event, such as a prolonged rainfall or storm surge. Additionally, the intensity of the disaster is difficult to determine without more information about the severity of the damage and the impact on the surrounding area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
