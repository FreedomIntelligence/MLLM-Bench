    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical characteristics that are typical for the species and breeds of the animals in the image, such as coat type and ear shape\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features three distinct animals: a puppy, a kitten, and another puppy. \n\n**Physical Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Puppy (left):** The puppy on the left has a short, smooth coat that is predominantly white with brown patches around its eyes and ears. Its ears are erect and triangular in shape, with a slight fold at the base. The puppy's nose is black, and its eyes are dark brown.\n*   **Kitten (center):** The kitten in the middle has a medium-length coat that is predominantly orange with white markings on its chest, paws, and face. Its ears are large and pointed, with a rounded tip. The kitten's nose is pink, and its eyes are yellow-green.\n*   **Puppy (right):** The puppy on the right has a medium-length coat that is predominantly cream-colored with a darker cream-colored patch on its side. Its ears are floppy and hang down to the sides of its head. The puppy's nose is brown, and its eyes are blue.\n\n**Comparison of Physical Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Coat Type:** The puppy on the left has a short, smooth coat, while the kitten has a medium-length coat and the puppy on the right has a medium-length coat as well.\n*   **Ear Shape:** The puppy on the left has erect, triangular ears, while the kitten has large, pointed ears and the puppy on the right has floppy ears.\n*   **Nose Color:** The puppy on the left has a black nose, while the kitten has a pink nose and the puppy on the right has a brown nose.\n*   **Eye Color:** The puppy on the left has dark brown eyes, while the kitten has yellow-green eyes and the puppy on the right has blue eyes.\n\nIn summary, the three animals in the image have distinct physical characteristics that are typical for their species and breeds. The puppy on the left has a short, smooth coat and erect ears, while the kitten has a medium-length coat and large, pointed ears. The puppy on the right has a medium-length coat and floppy ears. Overall, the image showcases the unique physical characteristics of each animal, highlighting their individual traits and features.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features three puppies and a kitten, showcasing a mix of species and breeds. The puppies present in the image can be characterized by their furry coats and dog-like features, such as pointy ears and a muzzle. The cat, on the other hand, is characterized by its sleek, furry coat, large pointy ears, and, of course, a more elongated body. The ears of the dogs are pointed upwards, which is a typical characteristic of many dog breeds, whereas the cat has large, pointed ears, which is a more cat-like feature. By comparing these physical characteristics, one can appreciate the differences between the animals and their respective species and breeds.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare coat types: smooth white with tan patches, fluffy long-haired, soft short cream-colored.\n2. Compare ear shapes: partially folded, pointed and floppy.",
