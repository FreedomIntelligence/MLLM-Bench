    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that not only describes what is seen but also evokes the other senses, such as the smell of the fresh peaches or the taste of the jam, to create a multi-sensory experience.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**A Still Life of Fresh Peaches and Homemade Jam**\n\nThe image presents a warm and inviting still life, evoking the senses of sight, smell, and taste.\n\n**Visual Description**\n\nIn the foreground, a basket of fresh peaches takes center stage, their vibrant orange hue and soft, fuzzy texture inviting the viewer to reach out and touch. The peaches are piled high, with some spilling out of the basket onto the table. To the left of the basket stands a jar of homemade jam, its rich, dark red color and ruffled white cloth lid adding a touch of rustic charm to the scene.\n\n**Sensory Experience**\n\nAs the viewer's eyes wander, they are drawn to the subtle details of the scene. The soft, golden light that illuminates the peaches and jar casts a warm glow, inviting the viewer to step into the cozy atmosphere of the kitchen. The scent of fresh peaches wafts up, sweet and heady, filling the air with the promise of summer's bounty. The taste of the homemade jam lingers on the palate, its rich, fruity flavor a perfect complement to the sweetness of the peaches.\n\n**Background and Context**\n\nIn the background, a dark wall provides a subtle contrast to the warm tones of the peaches and jam. A wooden barrel or bucket sits to the right of the basket, adding a touch of rustic charm to the scene. The overall effect is one of warmth and comfort, as if the viewer has stumbled upon a secret kitchen where the scent of fresh peaches and homemade jam fills the air.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis still life is more than just a pretty picture - it's an invitation to step into a world of warmth and comfort, where the senses are awakened and the heart is filled with joy. Whether you're a foodie, an artist, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of everyday life, this image is sure to delight.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a large woven basket filled with a variety of ripe peaches, placed beside a wooden table. Their colors range from vibrant reds to deep oranges, and they appear to be fresh and juicy. The basket, which seems to be handmade, lends a rustic charm to the scene. Next to the basket, there is a white ceramic jar filled with a sweet, homemade jam. The aroma of the peaches entices the senses, while the taste of the jam offers a delightful contrast to the freshness of the fruit. The combination of these elements creates a delightful and nostalgia-inducing experience that captures the essence of a sunny summer day spent outdoors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes visual description of peaches, jam jar, and setting.\n2. Caption evokes sense of smell (e.g., fresh peaches) and taste (e.g., sweet jam).\n3.
