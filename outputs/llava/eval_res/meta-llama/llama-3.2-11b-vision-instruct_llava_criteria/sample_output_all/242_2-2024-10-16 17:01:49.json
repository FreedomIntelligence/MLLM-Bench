    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the different attributes of these two types of shoes and describe how these different attributes realize the specific functions of shoes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Shoe Attributes and Functions**\n\nThe two shoes in the image exhibit distinct attributes that fulfill specific functions.\n\n* **Upper Material**: The black shoe features a leather upper, providing durability and breathability, while the white shoe has a mesh upper, offering flexibility and ventilation.\n* **Sole Material**: The black shoe has a rubber outsole, providing traction and shock absorption, whereas the white shoe has a foam midsole, offering cushioning and support.\n* **Closure System**: The black shoe has a lace-up closure, allowing for a secure fit, whereas the white shoe has a slip-on design, providing ease of use.\n* **Lining**: The black shoe has a fabric lining, providing comfort and breathability, whereas the white shoe has a synthetic lining, offering durability and moisture-wicking properties.\n* **Heel Counter**: The black shoe has a rigid heel counter, providing stability and support, whereas the white shoe has a soft heel counter, offering flexibility and comfort.\n* **Toe Box**: The black shoe has a narrow toe box, providing a snug fit, whereas the white shoe has a roomy toe box, offering comfort and space for toes.\n* **Weight**: The white shoe is lighter than the black shoe, making it suitable for running and other high-impact activities.\n* **Style**: The black shoe has a sleek and sporty design, whereas the white shoe has a more casual and relaxed look.\n\nThese attributes work together to provide the specific functions of each shoe, such as support, comfort, and style.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two shoes with different attributes on a tile floor. One is a black and white athletic shoe with laces, while the other is a pink and black Adidas athletic shoe with laces. These distinct attributes indicate varying purposes and functions of the shoes.\n\nThe black and white shoe is a nike shoe with white shoelaces, which suggests that it is designed for athletic activities like running or sports. Nike shoes are known for their performance, durability, and comfort. The black and white color scheme provides a neutral backdrop, making the shoes easy to match with various outfits and athletic gear.\n\nOn the other hand, the pink and black Adidas shoe is also designed for athletic activities and sports. Adidas shoes are recognized for their performance and style as well. The pink and black color scheme adds a stylish touch to the shoe, making it stand out from the black and white Nike shoe. This could be appealing to some individuals who enjoy expressing their personal style while engaging in sports or exercising.\n\nBoth shoes have laces, which are essential for securing the shoe to the wearer's foot, providing stability, and support during various activities. The laces can also be easily adjusted to fit the wearer's preferences or used to help maintain a snug fit and prevent the shoes from slipping.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify attributes (material, sole, shape, etc.) specific to the sneaker and skate shoe.\n2. Explain how each attribute contributes to the shoe's function (running, skating).",
