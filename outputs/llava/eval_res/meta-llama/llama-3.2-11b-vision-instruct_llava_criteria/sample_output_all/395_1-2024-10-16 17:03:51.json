Here are the key changes:\n\n**Safety:**\n\n*   **Airframe strength:** The Wright Flyer's wooden structure was prone to cracking and breaking. Modern aircraft use lightweight yet incredibly strong materials like carbon fiber.\n*   **Control systems:** The Wright Flyer's wing warping system was replaced by more efficient control systems, such as ailerons and elevators.\n*   **Engine reliability:** Early engines were unreliable and prone to failure. Modern engines are much more reliable and efficient.\n*   **Avionics:** The introduction of avionics has significantly improved safety by providing pilots with real-time flight data and navigation information.\n\n**Passenger Experience:**\n\n*   **Comfort:** The Wright Flyer was a rickety, open-cockpit aircraft. Modern aircraft offer much greater comfort, with pressurized cabins, comfortable seating, and amenities like in-flight entertainment.\n*   **Noise reduction:** Early aircraft were very loud. Modern aircraft have noise-reducing features like soundproofing and noise-cancelling technology.\n*   **Cabin pressure:** The Wright Flyer's cabin was not pressurized, leading to altitude sickness. Modern aircraft maintain a comfortable cabin pressure.\n*   **In-flight services:** Modern aircraft offer a range of in-flight services, including food and beverage, Wi-Fi, and entertainment options.\n\n**Future Predictions:**\n\n*   **Electric propulsion:** Electric propulsion systems will become more prevalent, offering greater efficiency and reduced noise.\n*   **Advanced materials:** New materials will continue to be developed, leading to even lighter and stronger aircraft.\n*   **Autonomous systems:** Autonomous systems will become more common, improving safety and reducing pilot workload.\n*   **Sustainable aviation fuels:** Sustainable aviation fuels will replace traditional fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.\n\nOverall, the future of aircraft design will prioritize sustainability, efficiency, and passenger comfort, leading to a safer and more enjoyable travel experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify historical trends in aircraft safety and passenger experience from the image.\n2. Assess the accuracy of predicted future aircraft design enhancements in comfort and safety.\n3. Evaluate the comprehensiveness of the travel experience improvements discussed.",
