    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound appears to be a small, shallow cut or abrasion on the palm of the hand. It is located near the base of the thumb and is approximately 1/4 inch in diameter. The wound is not deep and does not appear to be infected.\n\nBased on the image, it is likely that the wound was caused by a minor accident or injury, such as a fall or a scrape. It is important to keep the wound clean and dry to promote healing. You can do this by washing the area with soap and water, patting it dry with a clean towel, and applying an antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection.\n\nTo further promote healing, you can also apply a bandage or dressing to protect the wound from further irritation and infection. If the wound becomes red, swollen, or painful, or if you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus, seek medical attention.\n\nIt is also important to note that if the wound does not heal within a few days or if it becomes worse, you should seek medical attention. A healthcare professional can assess the wound and provide further guidance on how to care for it.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
