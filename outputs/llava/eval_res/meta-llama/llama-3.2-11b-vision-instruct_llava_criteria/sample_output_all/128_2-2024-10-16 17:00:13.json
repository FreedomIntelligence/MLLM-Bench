    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the mood and possible reflections of the character in the painting, considering the symbolism of the cloth, background and the objects he looks at.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe painting 'Balaam's Ass' by Rembrandt, created in 1650, depicts a scene from the Old Testament where Balaam, a prophet, is on his way to curse the Israelites but is instead instructed by his ass to take another path. The mood of the painting is one of contemplation and perhaps a hint of divine intervention. The cloth, which might be interpreted as a symbol of Balaam's divine mission or his attire as a prophet, adds to the solemnity of the scene. The background, which could be seen as a representation of the wilderness or the path to the Israelites, suggests a journey of spiritual awakening or the path to enlightenment. The objects Balaam looks at, possibly the ass or the landscape, indicate his focus on the immediate task at hand and his connection with the natural world and the divine guidance he receives from his ass. Overall, the painting conveys a sense of stillness and the moment of epiphany, where Balaam is forced to reconsider his mission and possibly his beliefs.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the painting, the bearded man with a long white beard is sitting down and looking into a mirror. He is dressed in a long blue robe, which suggests a sense of wisdom or spirituality. The background features a cave and some rocks, evoking a feeling of introspection or contemplation. The cloth and the presence of a book near the man further indicate a connection to knowledge and possibly a deeper understanding of life. The man seems to be reflecting on his spiritual journey or contemplating life's lessons, as he seems to be absorbed in thought or prayer. The man's age and beard also add to the overall impression of experience and wisdom. Overall, the image portrays a contemplative and thoughtful mood, with the man seemingly seeking insight or guidance through introspection and reflection.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the character's mood, considering posture, facial expression, and lighting.\n2. Analyze symbolism of the cloth and background in relation to the character's mood.",
