    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the immediate corrections the teacher is likely to make to the student's technique and the next notes or scales they will transition to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it appears that the teacher might be correcting the student's technique and posture while playing the violin. The teacher could be emphasizing the importance of proper hand placement, finger alignment, and bowing technique to ensure a smooth and refined performance. \n\nAs for the next notes or scales, it is difficult to predict without knowing the actual piece they are working on. However, the teacher might suggest the student practice and transition between different finger positions, arpeggios, or even work on integrating more complex musical elements such as dynamics, harmony, or articulation. The teacher's guidance will depend on the skill level and needs of the student, ensuring a steady progression in their musical journey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe teacher is likely to correct the student's technique by adjusting the position of their left hand and fingers on the neck of the violin, and ensuring that their right hand is properly placed to strike the strings. The teacher may also advise the student to focus on their bowing technique, such as maintaining a consistent bow speed and pressure. After correcting the student's technique, the teacher will likely transition them to a new set of notes or scales that require the same level of precision and control, such as scales in different keys or more complex melodies.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify specific technique adjustments the teacher may suggest (hand position, bow grip, posture).\n2. Predict the next musical elements to be taught (scales, specific notes, dynamics).\n3. Ensure predictions are plausible and based on the student's current playing posture and technique.",
