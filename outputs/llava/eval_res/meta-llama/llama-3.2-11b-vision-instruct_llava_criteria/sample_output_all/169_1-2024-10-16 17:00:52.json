    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image provides a step-by-step guide on how to open a new book, accompanied by illustrations of each step. The instructions are as follows:\n\n1. Place the book with its back on a table.\n2. Let the front cover down.\n3. Then the back cover.\n4. Then open a few leaves in front.\n5. Then a few at the back, alternating front and back, gently pressing them down until the center is reached.\n\nAdditionally, the image offers two alternative methods for opening the book:\n\n* Do this two or three times in order to limber up the binding. Should you open the volume roughly or carelessly, you may break the back and cause the leaves to loosen.\n* Never force the back; if it does not readily yield, it is too tightly or strongly lined. It needs gentle treatment, much the same as a machine needs lubricating.\n\nThe clarity and effectiveness of the instructions are high, as they provide a clear and concise guide for opening a new book. The use of illustrations helps to visually demonstrate each step, making it easier for the reader to understand and follow along. The addition of alternative methods and warnings about potential pitfalls adds an extra layer of clarity and effectiveness to the instructions. Overall, the image provides a well-structured and easy-to-follow guide for opening a new book.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List steps to open a new book: place on table, front cover, back cover, alternate leaves, press gently, repeat if needed.\n2. Assess if instructions are clear: sequential order, simple language, easy to follow.\n3. Evaluate effectiveness: steps lead to opening without damaging the book's binding.",
