    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCreate a caption that contrasts the seasonal characteristics evident and environment in the image, such as the colors of the leaves suggesting autumn.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe picturesque scene is set in a valley where trees, specifically apple trees, change colors, indicating autumn. The leaves showcase a warm and vibrant palette, with some appearing red, orange, and yellow, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and abundance. In stark contrast, the house and the surrounding environment are green, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape during the season of transition. The vivid colors and the presence of the house in the background blend harmoniously to accentuate the serene and colorful ambiance of the valley.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a serene rural landscape, characterized by rolling hills and a meandering road that winds its way through the scenery. The scene is set against a backdrop of lush greenery, with trees and bushes dotting the landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, a field of vibrant orange and red trees stands out, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The trees are scattered across the field, creating a sense of depth and texture. Beyond the field, the rolling hills stretch out, covered in a carpet of green grass and dotted with trees and bushes. The hills rise and fall in gentle waves, creating a sense of movement and energy.\n\nIn the background, a few buildings can be seen, including what appears to be a house or farmhouse. The buildings are nestled among the hills, blending seamlessly into the natural surroundings. The overall effect is one of tranquility and peace, inviting the viewer to step into the idyllic world depicted in the image.\n\nThe image exudes a sense of nostalgia and longing, evoking feelings of warmth and comfort. The vibrant colors of the trees and the lush greenery create a sense of vibrancy and life, while the rolling hills and meandering road add a sense of movement and energy. The image is a beautiful representation of the natural world, inviting the viewer to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of the rural landscape.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
