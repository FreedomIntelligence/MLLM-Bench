    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCould you analyze the potential causes of the vehicular accident in the image, considering the extent of damage to the vehicle?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a rear-end collision between two vehicles, with the silver car appearing to have been struck from behind by the blue car. The damage to the silver car's trunk and bumper suggests that the impact was significant, and the blue car's taillights are also damaged, indicating that it was likely traveling at a moderate to high speed when the accident occurred.\n\nThere are several potential causes of this accident, including:\n\n1. **Speeding**: If the blue car was traveling at a high speed, it may have been unable to stop in time to avoid hitting the silver car.\n2. **Distracted driving**: The driver of the blue car may have been distracted by their phone, radio, or another passenger, causing them to fail to notice the silver car in front of them.\n3. **Following too closely**: If the blue car was following the silver car too closely, it may have been unable to stop in time to avoid hitting it.\n4. **Poor road conditions**: If the road was wet, icy, or otherwise slippery, it may have contributed to the accident by reducing the blue car's ability to stop in time.\n5. **Mechanical failure**: A mechanical failure in the blue car, such as a faulty brake system, may have caused it to lose control and hit the silver car.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact cause of the accident can only be determined by an investigation, which may involve reviewing traffic camera footage, interviewing witnesses, and examining the vehicles involved.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, two cars are parked on the side of the road, one of which seems to have sustained significant damage from the collision. The extent of the damage suggests that the accident was severe. Possible causes of such an accident can be:\n\n1. Reckless driving: Two vehicles could have been traveling at high speeds, leading to a loss of control, resulting in a head-on collision.\n2. Vehicle malfunction: One of the vehicles might have experienced mechanical failure, leading to a loss of control or an inability to respond to the approaching vehicle.\n3. Weather conditions: Slippery or wet roads can reduce tire grip and control, increasing the risk of accidents.\n4. Driver's distraction or fatigue: Both drivers might have been momentarily distracted or fatigued, leading to a lack of attention on the road and the inability to react to the approaching vehicle in time.\n5. Impaired judgment or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs: The drivers might have been impaired, leading to poor decision-making, and an increased likelihood of a collision.\n\nIt is essential to understand that the specific cause of the crash cannot be determined solely from the image, but these are potential factors that could have contributed to the accident. Regardless of the cause, the image emphasizes the importance of safe driving practices and being aware of one's surroundings to prevent such severe accidents.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the point of impact and describe the extent of damage to both vehicles.\n2. Mention the potential causes such as a sudden brake from the front car.",
