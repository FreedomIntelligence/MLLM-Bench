    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if this photo is real or computer-generated, analyzing both the image's composition and any anachronisms present. Provide a thorough explanation of your findings.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a tiger standing among tall lush green grass, and it appears to be a true photo. To confirm this, one can analyze the image's composition, lighting, and any anachronisms present. Firstly, the tiger's facial expression and details of its whiskers, mouth, and other features are realistic, indicating the authenticity of the image. Secondly, the grass appears to be quite realistic, with many intricate details and subtle lighting that provide depth to the scene.\n\nThere are no evident anachronisms or inconsistencies that suggest the image is computer-generated. In a computer-generated image, one might expect to see an artificial background, unnatural textures, or other cues that indicate it is not a real photograph. However, in this case, we only see the tiger interacting with its natural grassy environment, making it a convincing representation of a real tiger captured in a natural setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Image Description**\n\n* The photo appears to be computer-generated, with a composition that suggests manipulation.\n* The tiger's fur exhibits a uniform texture, with no visible individual hairs.\n* The grass blades are perfectly straight and symmetrical, indicating potential editing.\n* The background is overly green and lacks natural depth, further supporting the image's artificial nature.\n* The overall image quality is too high to be a realistic photograph, suggesting a computer-generated origin.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. By analyzing image quality, textures, lighting, and shadows for signs of digital manipulation, one can verify the authenticity of the image.\n2. Evaluate the depth of the explanation, ensuring it aligns with the standard answer stating the photo is real.",
