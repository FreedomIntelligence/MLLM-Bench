    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo predict the trajectories of the vehicles in the next few seconds and provide advice on how drivers can avoid collision, we need to analyze the current motion of the vehicles and the environment they are in. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Observe the Vehicles' Positions and Directions**: Identify the positions, directions, and speeds of the vehicles involved. This information can be obtained from visual observation or, if available, from traffic cameras or sensors.\n\n2. **Assess the Road Conditions**: Note any obstacles, weather conditions (such as rain, snow, or fog), and the road's surface (wet, icy, or dry). These factors can significantly affect braking and turning capabilities.\n\n3. **Determine the Vehicles' Relative Speeds and Separation**: Calculate the relative speed between the vehicles and their separation distance. This will help in understanding how quickly they are approaching each other and how much time is available to react.\n\n4. **Predict the Vehicles' Trajectories**: Based on the observed directions, speeds, and any given trajectory (e.g., straight, turning), predict where each vehicle will be in the next few seconds. Consider the effects of deceleration, acceleration, and turning.\n\n5. **Identify Potential Collision Points**: Determine if there are any points where the predicted trajectories of the vehicles intersect, indicating a potential collision.\n\n6. **Analyze the Time to Collision (TTC)**: Calculate the TTC, which is the time it would take for the vehicles to collide if they continue on their current paths. A shorter TTC indicates a higher risk of collision.\n\n7. **Provide Avoidance Advice**: For each vehicle, advise the driver on the necessary actions to avoid collision based on the predicted trajectories and TTC. This could include changing lanes, slowing down, or taking evasive maneuvers.\n\n8. **Consider Additional Factors**: If applicable, consider other factors such as the presence of pedestrians, cyclists, or other road users that could be affected by the vehicles' actions.\n\n**Example Advice for Drivers:**\n\n- **Vehicle A (White SUV)**: If Vehicle A is traveling at a higher speed than Vehicle B and is on a collision course, advise the driver to slow down as quickly and smoothly as possible. If the road conditions are slippery, suggest using low gear if the vehicle is equipped with one to maintain control.\n\n- **Vehicle B (Blue Car)**: If Vehicle B is approaching a turn and Vehicle A is coming from the opposite direction, advise the driver to be prepared to stop or slow down significantly. If the road allows, suggest turning into a safe space or the shoulder to avoid the collision.\n\n- **General Advice**: Always maintain a safe following distance to allow time to react to unexpected situations. Use headlights to increase visibility, especially in low-light conditions. Avoid distractions while driving, and be prepared to adapt your driving to changing road conditions.\n\nBy following these steps and providing clear advice to drivers, the risk of collision can be significantly reduced.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
