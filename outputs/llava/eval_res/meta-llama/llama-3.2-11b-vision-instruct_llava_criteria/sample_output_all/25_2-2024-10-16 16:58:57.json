    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the woman doing? Why does she hold a microphone?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman in the image appears to be singing into a microphone. She is holding the microphone up to her mouth with her right hand, and her left hand is raised in a gesture that suggests she is performing or entertaining. The microphone is black and has a long cord attached to it, which suggests that she is using it to amplify her voice for an audience. The woman's facial expression and body language suggest that she is enjoying herself and is fully engaged in the performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe woman is singing with her mouth wide open while holding a microphone. She is likely at a concert or a live event, where she is the main performer. Holding a microphone is essential for amplifying her voice so that the audience can hear her clearly and loudly. The woman's dramatic performance, combined with her full-mouthed singing, enhances the energy and excitement of the event, engaging the audience and creating a memorable experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the woman is singing.\n2. Look for mention of a microphone and open mouth as indicators of singing.\n3. Description of the woman's expressive body language or facial expression.",
