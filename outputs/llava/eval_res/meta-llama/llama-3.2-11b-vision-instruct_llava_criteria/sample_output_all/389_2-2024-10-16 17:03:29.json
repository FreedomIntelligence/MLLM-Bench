    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDeduce the possible techniques the standing man going to use based on the current stance and gesture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe standing man appears to be preparing to execute a suplex, a professional wrestling maneuver where one wrestler lifts the opponent up and over their shoulders, typically resulting in a throw to the mat. The man's bent knees and backward lean suggest he is about to lift the person, while his arms are positioned to grasp the opponent's legs or waist. This technique is often used to gain control or overwhelm an opponent in a wrestling match.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nGiven the current stance and gesture of the standing man holding another man in a chair above his head, it is unlikely that the standing man is going to use any techniques involving physical contact or direct interaction with the man being held. Instead, it seems more likely that the standing man is using his upper body strength and balance to pose the man in the chair above his head, showcasing his ability or demonstrating a particular skill. This could be part of a performance or an exhibition of athleticism, rather than participating in a sports event or combat scenario.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the current physical stance and gesture of the man standing.\n2. Predict the next likely wrestling move or technique based on stance and gesture.\n3. Ensure the prediction is plausible within the context of wrestling.",
