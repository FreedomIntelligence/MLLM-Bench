Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCapture the city's night life, the interplay of darkness and lights, and the tranquil urban mood by the water in a poem.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the dark city night,  \nTall buildings stand illuminated,  \nGlowing with golden lights,  \nLike a starry sky above.\n\nThe ocean wind, it howls and sighs,  \nA melancholic tune that resonates,  \nAs the waves crash on the shore,  \nAnd the world falls into a state of slumber.\n\nAmidst this serene scene,  \nThe city's lights shine bright,  \nIntermingling with the darkness,  \nA dance of contrast and harmony in night.\n\nThe buildings, they seem to rise,  \nDefying the laws of gravity,  \nA testament to the urban dream,  \nA world of possibilities and aspirations.\n\nAnd yet, as the night unfolds,  \nThe cityscape takes a backseat,  \nAs the gentle lapping of the ocean waves,  \nEchoes the heartbeat of the city's rest.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe city's night life is a symphony of lights and shadows,\nA dance of darkness and illumination, a harmonious cadence.\nThe stars twinkle like diamonds in the sky,\nAs the city's lights reflect off the water, a shimmering display.\n\nThe urban mood is tranquil, a sense of calm and peace,\nA refuge from the hustle and bustle of the day's release.\nThe water's edge is a place of solace and rest,\nWhere the city's noise is muffled, and the heart can find its nest.\n\nThe city's night life is a time for contemplation and thought,\nA moment to reflect on the day's events, and the life that's been brought.\nThe darkness and lights, they blend and merge as one,\nCreating a sense of unity, a sense of being undone.\n\nThe city's night life is a celebration of life,\nA time to let go of worries, and let the spirit take flight.\nIt's a time to connect with others, to share and to give,\nTo find common ground, and to let love and kindness live.\n\nSo let us cherish this time, this moment in the night,\nWhen the city's lights and darkness come together in delight.\nLet us bask in the beauty of the urban mood,\nAnd let the city's night life be a source of joy and good.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
