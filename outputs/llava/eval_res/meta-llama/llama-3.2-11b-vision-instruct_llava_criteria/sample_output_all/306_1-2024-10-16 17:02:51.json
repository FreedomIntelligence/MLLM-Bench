    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nOne glass falls on the wooden floor in the figure, and another identical glass falls in the area interspersed with beige and white in the figure, both from a height of half a meter from the floor. Please analyze which one is more likely to break.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the given image, we have two identical glasses, one falling on a wooden floor and another on a beige and white checkered floor. The wooden floor, being a solid and stiff material, is more likely to cause the glass to break upon impact due to its hard nature. In contrast, the beige and white checkered floor is more flexible and may provide some cushioning, which increases the likelihood that the glass falling on this surface would be less likely to break upon impact.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe glass that falls on the wooden floor is more likely to break than the glass that falls in the area interspersed with beige and white. This is because the wooden floor is harder than the foam tiles in the area interspersed with beige and white. As a result, the impact of the glass falling on the wooden floor will be greater, making it more likely to break.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the first glass is more likely to break.\n2. Analyze surface hardness and potential cushioning for both landing areas.\n3. Determine which glass is more likely to break based on physical reasoning.",
