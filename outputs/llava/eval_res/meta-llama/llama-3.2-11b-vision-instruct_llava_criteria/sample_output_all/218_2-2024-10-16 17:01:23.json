    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the radar chart, what does Libertarianism feature?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe radar chart indicates that Libertarianism is positioned in the upper right quadrant, with a notable emphasis on individualism and a moderate level of skepticism of authority. This suggests that Libertarians tend to prioritize individual freedom and autonomy, while also maintaining a degree of skepticism towards authority and institutions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe radar chart shows that Libertarianism features a strong emphasis on individualism, freedom, and minimal government intervention. It is located near the center of the chart, surrounded by various other ideologies, such as Postmodernism, Marxism, and Feminism. The radar chart indicates that while there is some overlap between these ideologies, Libertarianism stands out due to its primary focus on individual freedom and limited government involvement. This emphasis distinguishes it from other ideologies, which may prioritize collective rights, social equality, or broader governmental intervention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Libertarianism's highest score as Liberty.\n2. Identify Libertarianism's lowest score as either Equality or Progress, since these two aspects have approximately the same scores that cannot be differentiated.\n",
