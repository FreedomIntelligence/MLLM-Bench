    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease carefully examine the design of the bed and inform me of all its possible uses.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe bed in this image is an oddly shaped or square design made of wood and white. It features multiple pillows, giving it a cozy and comfortable appearance. Additionally, there are two benches in the room, one located near the foot of the bed and the other placed farther away. The room also contains other decorative elements, such as two vases situated on the floor.\n\nThis unique bed design, combined with the presence of benches, suggests that the room may serve multiple purposes other than just a bedroom. The benches can be used as seating for activities such as reading, watching television, or even as a place for guests to sit while conversing. The room could be a versatile space where guests can relax, socialize, or even work on a laptop or perform other tasks while enjoying the comfortable and inviting atmosphere created by the bed and benches.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bed in the image is a modern, minimalist design with a tufted headboard and a low profile. It appears to be a platform bed, meaning it does not have a traditional box spring or mattress foundation. The bed is upholstered in a light-colored fabric or leather, giving it a sleek and sophisticated look.\n\nThe bed's design suggests that it could be used for various purposes beyond just sleeping. Here are some possible uses:\n\n1. **Guest room**: The bed's modern design and comfortable appearance make it an ideal choice for a guest room. It would provide a cozy and inviting space for visitors to rest and relax.\n2. **Master bedroom**: As a master bedroom bed, this design would add a touch of elegance and sophistication to the room. The low profile and minimalist style would create a sense of openness and airiness.\n3. **Bedroom seating area**: The bed's low profile and comfortable appearance make it a potential seating area as well. It could be used as a daybed or a reading nook, providing a cozy spot to relax and unwind.\n4. **Home office**: In a home office setting, the bed could be used as a desk or workspace. The low profile and minimalist design would allow for easy movement and flexibility.\n5. **Reading nook**: The bed's comfortable appearance and cozy atmosphere make it an ideal spot for reading. It could be used as a dedicated reading nook, providing a peaceful and quiet space to get lost in a good book.\n6. **Relaxation area**: The bed's design and comfort level make it an excellent choice for a relaxation area. It could be used as a meditation or yoga space, providing a calm and peaceful environment for relaxation and self-care.\n7. **Event space**: In a larger room or event space, the bed could be used as a focal point or conversation starter. Its modern design and comfortable appearance would make it an attractive feature for guests to gather around and socialize.\n\nOverall, the bed's design and comfort level make it a versatile piece of furniture that could be used in various settings and for different purposes.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify primary function of the bed (e.g., sleeping/resting) based on design.\n2. List additional functions (e.g., storage, seating) suggested by bed features.",
