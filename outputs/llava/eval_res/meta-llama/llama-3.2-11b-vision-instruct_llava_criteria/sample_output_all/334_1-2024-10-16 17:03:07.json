    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet appears to have a damaged handle, with the purple grip material torn and the black handle exposed. The damage is likely due to over-tightening or excessive force during play.\n\n**Repair Options:**\n\n* **Grip Replacement**: Replace the damaged grip with a new one, ensuring proper fitting and secure fastening to prevent further damage.\n* **Handle Repair**: Secure the exposed handle with a strong adhesive, such as epoxy or super glue, and wrap the handle with a protective tape or sleeve to prevent further damage.\n* **Racquet Replacement**: If the damage is extensive, consider replacing the racquet entirely, as it may be more cost-effective than attempting to repair it.\n\n**Preventing Future Damage:**\n\n* Regularly inspect the racquet for signs of wear and tear.\n* Avoid over-tightening the grip.\n* Use a racquet with a durable and comfortable grip.\n* Store the racquet properly to prevent damage from impact or scratches.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
