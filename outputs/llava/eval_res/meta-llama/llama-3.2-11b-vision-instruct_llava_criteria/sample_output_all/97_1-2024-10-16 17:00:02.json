    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the art movement the artwork can be associated with? Provide the unique stylistic features in the painting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork can be associated with the Surrealism art movement. In the painting, a woman is dressed in a blue gown, holding an orange rose, and an orange rose is also seen in the foreground. The unique stylistic features of the Surrealism art movement, such as dream-like, fantastical, and unrealistic imagery, are present in this painting. The scene depicted includes a mannequin's head in a top hat, which adds to the surreal and unconventional elements. The composition of the artwork, including the woman's dress, the orange rose, and the mannequin, creates a mysterious and imaginative atmosphere, which are characteristics of Surrealism.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork is a striking example of Surrealism, characterized by its dream-like imagery and juxtaposition of disparate elements. The painting features a woman in a blue dress with a funnel-shaped head, standing in a desert landscape with cracked earth and a large orange rose. The stylistic features of this artwork include:\n\n* The use of bold, vibrant colors to create a sense of drama and tension\n* The incorporation of unexpected objects, such as the funnel-shaped head and the large orange rose, to create a sense of surprise and unease\n* The use of negative space to create a sense of depth and atmosphere\n* The overall sense of surrealism, with the woman's body and the desert landscape blending together in a way that defies logic and reason.\n\nOverall, the artwork is a thought-provoking and visually striking representation of the Surrealist movement, with its unique blend of dream-like imagery and unexpected juxtapositions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly associates the artwork with surrealism.\n2. Check for mention of unique stylistic features indicating surrealism.\n3. Evaluate clarity and relevance of stylistic feature descriptions to surrealism.",
