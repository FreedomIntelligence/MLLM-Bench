    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a cat lying on a sidewalk, with a building in the background. The cat is an orange tabby with light-colored fur, and its eyes are brown. It is lying on its stomach, facing the camera, with its head slightly tilted to the right. Its ears are perked up, and its tail is curled up behind it.\n\nThe cat appears to be a stray or feral animal, as it is not wearing a collar or any other identification. The building in the background is a large, multi-story structure with a beige exterior and dark windows. There are several windows visible, including one on the top floor that appears to be open. The building's facade is clean and well-maintained, suggesting that it may be a commercial or residential property.\n\nOverall, the image suggests that the cat has found a comfortable spot to rest on the sidewalk outside the building, possibly seeking shelter from the elements or avoiding human interaction. The presence of the building in the background adds context to the scene, implying that the cat may be living in the area or visiting regularly.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
