    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the dynamics of the scene with the ship at sea, focusing on the interplay of colors and forms to deduce the emotional intensity presented in this piece.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the black and white drawing of a ship at sea, various colors and forms are used to create a sense of depth and emotional intensity. The dark and light tones within the foreground and background contrast to emphasize the ship's journey through the rough, choppy waters. The color palette further accentuates the contrast between the ship and its surroundings, drawing attention to its prominent presence.\n\nAdditionally, the silhouette of the ship's sails and the ropes emphasize its size and motion, creating a feeling of movement and purpose. The artist's choice to not include vibrant colors in the image adds an element of drama and intensity to the scene, evoking a sense of awe and adventure in response to the ocean's vastness and the ship's resilience.\n\nOverall, this black and white sketch of a ship at sea effectively conveys a powerful emotional impact with the interplay of colors and forms to represent the majesty and perseverance of the vessel amidst the challenging ocean conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image is a captivating chalk drawing of a majestic ship at sea, set against a dramatic and swirling sky. The ship, rendered in shades of brown and tan, dominates the foreground, its sails billowing in the wind. The waves beneath it are depicted in shades of blue and white, creating a sense of movement and energy.\n\nThe background sky is a striking feature, with swirling lines and shapes in shades of black, white, and brown, evoking a sense of turmoil and chaos. The overall effect is one of dynamic tension, as if the ship is being buffeted by the turbulent weather. The artist's use of color and composition creates a sense of drama and intensity, drawing the viewer's eye to the central image of the ship.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotional tone conveyed by the color contrasts and brushwork.\n2. Describe the interaction between the ship's form and the sea's motion.\n3. Assess how these elements contribute to the scene's emotional intensity.",
