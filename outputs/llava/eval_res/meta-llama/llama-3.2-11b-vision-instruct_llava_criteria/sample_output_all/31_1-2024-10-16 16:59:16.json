    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the sign in the image. What does this sign mean?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe sign in the image is a \"no thumbs up\" or \"no thumbs up to you\" sign, indicating that someone is not giving their approval or support. The thumbs up symbol is being crossed out, suggesting that it is not allowed or is actively discouraged in this particular context.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe sign in the image is a \"no hand gesture\" sign, which means that the person is not allowed to use their hands or make any gestures. This sign is often used in public places such as restaurants, theaters, or other venues where it's important to maintain order and decorum.\n\nIn this context, the sign is likely being used to indicate that the person should not touch or handle any objects, or make any gestures that could be distracting or disruptive to others. For example, if someone is sitting in a theater and starts gesturing wildly while watching a movie, they might be asked to stop by someone holding up this sign.\n\nOverall, the \"no hand gesture\" sign is a way of communicating that certain behaviors are not allowed or appreciated in a particular setting. It's an important tool for maintaining social norms and ensuring that everyone has a positive experience in a shared space.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the sign as indicating \"no hitchhiking.\"\n2. Explanation aligns with common understanding of hitchhiking prohibition.\n3. Answer must not include additional unrelated details or symbols.",
