    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, it appears that the skater boy is in mid-air, performing a trick on his skateboard. He is positioned above a bowl or ramp, with his board tilted upwards and his arms outstretched for balance. His legs are bent, and his feet are firmly planted on the board.\n\nTo predict the skater boy's next move, we can analyze the situation:\n\n1. The skater boy is currently airborne, which suggests that he has just launched himself from the ground or a lower platform.\n2. His board is tilted upwards, indicating that he is attempting to perform a trick that involves flipping or spinning the board.\n3. His arms are outstretched, which helps him maintain balance and control during the trick.\n4. His legs are bent, which allows him to absorb the impact of the landing and maintain stability.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is likely that the skater boy's next move will be to land the trick safely and smoothly. However, there is always a risk of injury when performing aerial stunts, especially if the landing is not executed perfectly.\n\nThe risk of the action can be assessed as follows:\n\n1. **Physical risk**: The skater boy is exposed to the risk of injury from falling or crashing into the bowl or ramp. If he fails to land the trick correctly, he could suffer injuries such as broken bones, concussions, or sprains.\n2. **Environmental risk**: The skater boy is skating in an outdoor environment, which means he is exposed to the elements (e.g., weather conditions, obstacles, and other skaters). If he loses control of his board or falls, he could collide with other skaters, obstacles, or the surrounding environment.\n3. **Equipment risk**: The skater boy is using a skateboard, which is a potentially hazardous piece of equipment. If the board malfunctions or breaks during the trick, it could cause him to lose control or suffer injuries.\n\nOverall, while the skater boy's next move is difficult to predict with certainty, it is clear that he is taking a risk by performing an aerial trick in an outdoor environment. To minimize the risk, he should ensure that he has sufficient skill and experience to execute the trick safely, wear appropriate protective gear, and skate within his limits.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
