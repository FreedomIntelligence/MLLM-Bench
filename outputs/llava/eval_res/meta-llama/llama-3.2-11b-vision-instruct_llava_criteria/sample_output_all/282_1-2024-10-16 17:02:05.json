    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease infer the occupation of the adult depicted in the picture, taking into account his actions and role within the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGiven the scene, with a man sitting in a chair surrounded by several young children and smiling, it is likely that the adult is a teacher or an educator. His role and interaction with the children indicate that he might be a teacher who is engaging with his students, teaching them or helping them learn in some way.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image provided, it appears that the adult is a teacher. The adult is sitting on a chair in the middle of a group of children, who are all sitting in a circle around him. The adult is likely the teacher, as he is surrounded by children and appears to be engaged in some kind of activity or discussion with them.\n\nThe teacher's role within the scene is likely to be educational, as he is surrounded by children and appears to be teaching or lecturing to them. The presence of a whiteboard in the background suggests that the teacher may be using visual aids to help the children learn, and the fact that the children are all facing the teacher and appear to be listening to him suggests that he is the center of attention and is leading the lesson.\n\nOverall, based on the image, it appears that the adult is a teacher who is engaged in a lesson or activity with a group of children.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must infer the adult is a teacher based on his interaction with children and classroom setting.2. Check for the presence of educational materials or environment indicative of teaching.",
