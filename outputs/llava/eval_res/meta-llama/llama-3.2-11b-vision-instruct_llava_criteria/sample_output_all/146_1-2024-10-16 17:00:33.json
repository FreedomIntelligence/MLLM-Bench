    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe cat's expression in the meme is exaggerated, with a dramatic change from a calm and relaxed demeanor to a wide-eyed, open-mouthed, and energetic appearance. This hyperbole contributes to the humor by:\n\n1. **Emphasizing the effect of coffee**: The cat's transformation from a sleepy, disinterested look to a wide-eyed, energetic expression humorously illustrates the energizing effect of coffee.\n2. **Exaggerating the reaction**: The cat's over-the-top reaction adds to the comedic effect, implying that the person who made the meme is also experiencing a strong caffeine boost.\n3. **Using anthropomorphism**: Anthropomorphizing the cat by giving it human-like emotions and reactions creates a relatable and amusing scenario for viewers who can identify with the experience of feeling energized after drinking coffee.\n4. **Playing on expectations**: The unexpected shift from a calm cat to an energetic one subverts the viewer's expectations, creating surprise and delight.\n\nOverall, the exaggerated expression of the cat contributes to the meme's humor by highlighting the energizing effect of coffee in a playful and relatable way.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
