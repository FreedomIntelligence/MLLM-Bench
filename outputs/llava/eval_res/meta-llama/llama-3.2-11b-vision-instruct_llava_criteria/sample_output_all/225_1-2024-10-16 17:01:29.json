    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the linear flow of energy in these food chains.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays several food chains, showing the linear flow of energy from plants to animals. These food chains include a carnivorous plant, such as a Venus flytrap and an aquatic plant like a water lily, both of which consume smaller organisms as their primary food source. The linear flow of energy is evident as the smaller organisms, such as insects or small fish, are consumed by larger organisms, like predators or carnivorous plants. The larger organisms, in turn, may be preyed upon by even larger animals, like lions or eagles. The image emphasizes the interconnection and dependency of various species in the ecosystem and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced and healthy environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Food Chain 1: Trees → Deer → Lion**\n\n* Trees are the primary producers, converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.\n* Deer feed on trees, transferring energy from the producer to the consumer.\n* Lions prey on deer, further transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n\n**Food Chain 2: Flower → Flies → Frog → Snake → Eagle**\n\n* Flowers are the primary producers, similar to trees, converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.\n* Flies feed on flowers, transferring energy from the producer to the consumer.\n* Frogs prey on flies, transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n* Snakes prey on frogs, transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n* Eagles prey on snakes, transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n\n**Food Chain 3: Flower → Small Fishes → Larger Fish → Birds**\n\n* Flowers are again the primary producers, converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis.\n* Small fishes feed on flowers, transferring energy from the producer to the consumer.\n* Larger fishes prey on small fishes, transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n* Birds prey on larger fishes, transferring energy from one consumer to another.\n\nIn summary, the linear flow of energy in these food chains is as follows:\n\n* Primary producers (trees, flowers) convert sunlight into energy.\n* Energy is transferred from one consumer to another through predation.\n* The flow of energy is linear, with each level building upon the previous one.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The first chain: trees -> deers -> lion\n2. The second chain: flower -> flies -> frog -> snake -> eagle.\n3. The third chain: flower -> small fishes -> larger fish -> birds.\n4. There is no strict format in describing each chain. However, the answer should explicitly and accurately points out every element on each chain.",
