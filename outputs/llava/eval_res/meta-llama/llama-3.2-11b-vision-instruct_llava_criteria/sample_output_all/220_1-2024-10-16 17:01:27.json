    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss the relationship between the oxpecker and warthog, and discuss how this interaction could benefit both organisms.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, we see a warthog surrounded by several oxpeckers feeding on ticks on its body. This interaction between the warthog and the oxpeckers is an example of a mutualistic relationship, which benefits both organisms involved.\n\nFor the warthog, the oxpeckers help in keeping the ticks and parasites on their body under control. Oxpeckers feed on the parasites and ticks, which can cause irritation and diseases to the warthog if left unchecked. This cleaning service provided by the oxpeckers helps the warthog maintain good health.\n\nFor the oxpeckers, this symbiotic relationship also benefits them by providing a consistent source of food. The ticks on the warthog are their primary food source, and the more they feed, the healthier the oxpecker becomes. Additionally, the oxpeckers get a good vantage point to spot potential threats from the warthog's heightened position. This can serve as an early warning system for the oxpeckers, as they can quickly escape from danger.\n\nIn conclusion, the mutualistic relationship between the warthog and the oxpeckers benefits both organisms as they help each other maintain their health and survive in their natural environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe oxpecker and warthog have a symbiotic relationship, where the oxpecker feeds on ticks and other parasites that infest the warthog's skin, providing a cleaning service to the warthog. In return, the warthog offers the oxpecker protection from predators and a safe place to nest. This interaction benefits both organisms, as the oxpecker gets a food source and the warthog gets rid of parasites that could harm it.\n\n*Answer*: The oxpecker and warthog have a mutualistic relationship, where both organisms benefit from each other's presence.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the interaction as mutualism symbiosis between oxpecker and warthog.\n2. Explain benefits for the oxpecker, such as feeding on parasites.\n3. Explain benefits for the warthog, like parasite removal and alert system.",
