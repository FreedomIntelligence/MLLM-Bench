    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is a meme that features a dog standing next to a painting of a dog dressed in human clothing. The caption reads, \"When payday lands and you start buying unnecessary things.\" \n\nThe humor in this meme comes from the relatable situation of overspending on unnecessary items after receiving a paycheck, and the unexpected twist of a dog being depicted as a wealthy individual. The image of the dog in human clothes adds to the comedic effect, implying that the dog has made some questionable financial decisions.\n\nThe meme is likely intended to poke fun at the common experience of overspending and the tendency to justify unnecessary purchases as \"treats\" or \"splurges.\" It may also be seen as a commentary on the human tendency to anthropomorphize animals, giving them human-like qualities and behaviors. Overall, the meme uses humor to highlight the absurdity of our spending habits and the ways in which we rationalize our choices.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
