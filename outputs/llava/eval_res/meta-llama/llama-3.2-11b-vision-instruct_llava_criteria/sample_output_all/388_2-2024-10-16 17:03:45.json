    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the series of actions in the image and predict the possible next action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a series of actions, likely a surgical procedure. The actions are as follows:\n\n*   T1: A person is lying on their back with their legs straight.\n*   T2: The person's legs are bent at the knees.\n*   T3: The person's legs are straight again.\n*   T4: The person's legs are bent at the knees again.\n*   T5: The person is sitting up.\n\nBased on the sequence of actions, it appears that the person is undergoing a surgical procedure, possibly a spinal fusion or a laminectomy. The actions suggest that the surgeon is accessing the spine through an incision in the lower back, and is manipulating the vertebrae to correct any misalignments or abnormalities.\n\nTo predict the possible next action, we can analyze the sequence of actions and the anatomical location of the incision. Since the person is sitting up at T5, it is likely that the surgeon has completed the procedure and is now closing the incision.\n\nTherefore, the possible next action would be to close the incision and dress the wound. This would involve suturing the skin and underlying tissues, applying dressings or bandages, and administering any necessary pain medication or antibiotics.\n\n*Answer*: The possible next action is to close the incision and dress the wound.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a series of actions, starting with a ball above each person or symbol. From this observation, it can be inferred that the possible next action might be the ball either falling or moving towards the person, symbol, or ball to initiate the next action of the sequence. The current actions in the image involve the interaction between the ball, persons, and symbols, suggesting that this scene might be a representation of a sports game, gymnastics, or a martial arts performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the sequence of actions leading up to the last depicted moment.\n2. Predict the next action based on the momentum and position of figures.\n3. Ensure prediction is plausible within the context of the image sequence.",
