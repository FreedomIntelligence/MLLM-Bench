    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the endoscopy image of the stomach, describe the image in detail and identify anomalies visible in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe endoscopy image of the stomach reveals a large, irregularly shaped mass occupying most of the stomach's interior. The mass exhibits a nodular surface with numerous small, rounded protrusions and is characterized by a reddish-pink coloration. The surrounding mucosa appears thickened and inflamed, with visible blood vessels and areas of ulceration.\n\n**Anomalies Visible in the Image**\n\n* **Massive Gastric Tumor**: A large, irregularly shaped mass occupying most of the stomach's interior.\n* **Nodular Surface**: The mass exhibits a nodular surface with numerous small, rounded protrusions.\n* **Reddish-Pink Coloration**: The mass is characterized by a reddish-pink coloration.\n* **Thickened and Inflamed Mucosa**: The surrounding mucosa appears thickened and inflamed.\n* **Visible Blood Vessels**: Visible blood vessels are present in the surrounding mucosa.\n* **Areas of Ulceration**: Areas of ulceration are visible in the surrounding mucosa.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe endoscopy image of the stomach reveals a massive gastric tumor with a nodular surface, thickened and inflamed mucosa, visible blood vessels, and areas of ulceration. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of gastric cancer, specifically a type of adenocarcinoma. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing, such as biopsy and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts an endoscopy of a stomach, revealing the pink and red interior of the gastrointestinal tract. The lining of the stomach appears swollen, with a large hole or hollow area in the middle. The hole, filled with small pink and red granules, suggests the presence of gastritis. The granules are also scattered throughout the stomach, both inside and outside the hollow space, further indicating inflammation. This scene suggests an ongoing condition like the stomach disease erosive gastritis, which can lead to complications if not properly managed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any visible anomalies in the stomach lining, such as abnormal growths or coloration.\n2. Describe the overall condition of the stomach mucosa, including texture and vascular pattern.\n3. Mention the presence of any normal anatomical structures, such as gastric folds.",
