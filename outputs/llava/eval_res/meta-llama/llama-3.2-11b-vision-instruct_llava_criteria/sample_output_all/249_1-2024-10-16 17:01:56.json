    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a comparison of the Earth and Mars. The Earth is depicted as a blue and white planet with clouds, while Mars is shown as a reddish-orange planet with a barren surface.\n\n**Atmospheric Conditions:**\n\n*   **Earth:** The Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. It is a thick atmosphere that supports life and maintains a stable climate.\n*   **Mars:** Mars' atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95.3%) with some nitrogen (2.7%) and argon (1.6%). The atmosphere is too thin to support liquid water, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.\n\n**Surface Features:**\n\n*   **Earth:** The Earth's surface features diverse landscapes, including oceans, continents, mountains, and valleys. It has a dynamic geology with tectonic plates that move, creating earthquakes and volcanoes.\n*   **Mars:** Mars' surface is characterized by vast deserts, craters, and volcanoes. It has a rocky terrain with numerous impact craters, indicating a geologically inactive surface. Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is located on Mars.\n\nIn summary, the image highlights the stark contrast between the Earth and Mars in terms of atmospheric conditions and surface features. While the Earth is teeming with life and has a complex geology, Mars is a barren, inhospitable world with a thin atmosphere and a geologically inactive surface.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
