    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze if the people in the image hold a ethical demand.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, the people in the image are holding up signs with political demands, which suggests that they are advocating for a particular cause or ethical position. Given the variety of signs they are holding, it indicates that they are representing diverse opinions or concerns, which is typically found in protests or demonstrations. By participating in such events, the individuals are voicing their opinions and raising awareness about the issues they consider important, with the intention of influencing societal change, policy-making, or public opinion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe people in the image are holding signs that read \"END RACISM\" and \"RACISM IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.\" These signs suggest that they are advocating for the end of racism and that racism is a harmful and unacceptable behavior. Based on the signs, it is likely that the people in the image are holding an ethical demand for an end to racism and discrimination.\n\nIt is worth noting that the people in the image are also holding signs that read \"BORDERS\" and \"WAR IS THE DRUMMER,\" which may indicate that they are also advocating for an end to war and violence. However, the primary focus of the image appears to be on the demand to end racism.\n\nOverall, the people in the image are holding an ethical demand for an end to racism and discrimination, and are advocating for a more just and equitable society.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the image depicts a demand for ethical treatment or social justice.\n2. Evaluate the presence of signs or expressions that convey an ethical stance.\n3. Determine the context of the demand, such as anti-racism or human rights.",
