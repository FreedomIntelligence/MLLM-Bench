    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe cow's expression and pose in this image are humorous because of the following elements:\n\n*   **Exaggerated Facial Expression**: The cow's face is contorted into an exaggerated expression, with its tongue sticking out and its eyes wide open. This comical pose is reminiscent of a human making a silly face.\n*   **Playful Pose**: The cow is standing in a field, looking directly at the camera, and sticking its tongue out. This playful pose is unexpected and adds to the comedic effect.\n*   **Anthropomorphism**: The cow's expression and pose humanize it, making it seem like it's trying to communicate with the viewer or play a prank on them. This anthropomorphism creates a sense of familiarity and playfulness, which is humorous.\n\nOverall, the combination of the cow's exaggerated expression, playful pose, and anthropomorphism creates a comedic effect that is both amusing and entertaining.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
