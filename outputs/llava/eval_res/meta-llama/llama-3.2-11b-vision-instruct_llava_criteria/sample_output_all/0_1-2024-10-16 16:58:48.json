    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the primary structure in the image and describe its architectural style and features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe primary structure in the image is the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge in New York City, built in 1883. It spans over the East River, connecting the borough of Brooklyn with Manhattan. The bridge has a distinctive twin-tower design, with two towers at the abutments on each end of the bridge. These towers house the cable supports and carry the weight of the suspended bridge deck, which is suspended from them. The bridge's architectural style is a blend of Gothic and Romanesque influences, making it an important historical and cultural landmark.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary structure in the image is a bridge, specifically the Manhattan Bridge, which spans the East River and connects the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York City.\n\n**Architectural Style and Features**\n\n* The bridge's architectural style is a hybrid of Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, with a distinctive arched shape and ornate details.\n* The bridge features:\n\t+ A series of arches that rise to meet at a central point, creating a dramatic and iconic silhouette.\n\t+ A series of piers that support the bridge's roadway and pedestrian walkways.\n\t+ A series of towers that rise from the piers, supporting the bridge's cables and suspender cables.\n* The bridge's design is characterized by:\n\t+ A sense of grandeur and drama, reflecting the city's industrial and commercial heritage.\n\t+ A blend of traditional and modern elements, reflecting the city's eclectic and diverse cultural landscape.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the primary structure as a bridge.\n2. Describe the architectural style of the bridge (e.g., suspension, cable-stayed).\n3. Mention specific features of the bridge (e.g., towers, cables).",
