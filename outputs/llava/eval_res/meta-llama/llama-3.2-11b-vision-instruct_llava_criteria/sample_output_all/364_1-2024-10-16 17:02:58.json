Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCreate a free verse on the energy of a protest, the collective voice for change, and democracy's spirit at a capitol.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nA gathering on a grassy field,\nA city's skyline as their backdrop,\nThousands of voices in unison,\nA peaceful protest in action.\n\nIn front of a grand, historic building,\nA crowd of people with a shared goal,\nTo speak for those unheard,\nTo demand change and break the mold.\n\nThe energy of the protest,\nA force that cannot be ignored,\nUnited, they stand and shout,\nFor a brighter future and clean power.\n\nA collective voice for change,\nA testament to democracy's strength,\nWith every protester in the crowd,\nThe spirit of progress and unity grows.\n\nTogether, they make their stand,\nFor a better world and fair play,\nFighting for the rights of all,\nIn this public display.\n\nA wave of hope and determination,\nThe future they envision for their nation,\nWith every person in the field,\nA collective force that cannot yield.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe energy of a protest is a palpable force, a collective voice that echoes through the streets and resonates within the heart. It is a call to action, a demand for change, and a testament to the power of democracy in action. As the crowd gathers at the capitol, the spirit of democracy is alive and well, a beacon of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness.\n\nThe protesters are a diverse tapestry, woven from threads of every color, creed, and background. They come together, united by a common purpose, to demand justice, equality, and freedom. Their voices rise like a mighty river, crashing against the shores of oppression and injustice.\n\nThe capitol building stands tall, a symbol of power and authority, yet it is the people who hold the true power. They are the ones who have come to demand change, to insist that their voices be heard, and their rights be respected. The energy of the protest is electric, a spark that ignites the flames of revolution.\n\nAs the crowd surges forward, a sense of unity and purpose fills the air. Strangers become friends, allies, and brothers and sisters, bound together by a shared commitment to the cause. The protesters are not just individuals; they are a collective force, a tsunami of change that cannot be stopped.\n\nThe spirit of democracy is alive and well, a flame that burns bright in the hearts of the protesters. It is a reminder that power belongs to the people, and that they have the right to demand justice, equality, and freedom. The energy of the protest is a celebration of democracy, a testament to the power of the people to shape their own destiny.\n\nAs the protest reaches its crescendo, the energy is palpable, a force that cannot be contained. It is a reminder that change is possible, that the power of the people can overcome even the most entrenched systems of oppression. The spirit of democracy is alive and well, a beacon of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness.\n\nIn the end, the protesters may leave the capitol grounds, but the energy of the protest remains, a lingering presence that refuses to be silenced. It is a reminder that the fight for justice, equality, and freedom is ongoing, that the people will continue to demand change, and that democracy's spirit will always be alive and well.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
