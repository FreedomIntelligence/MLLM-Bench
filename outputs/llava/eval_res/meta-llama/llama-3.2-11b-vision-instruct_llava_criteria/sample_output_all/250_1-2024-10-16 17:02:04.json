    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two images closely to identify and compare the differences between them as many as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe two images show a brown and black dog in different poses and settings. The first image features the dog carrying a bottle in its mouth, with one paw on a bowl and the other paw on a cat. The dog appears to be placing the bottle into the bowl. The second image displays the dog with a bone in its mouth, standing next to a house.\n\nIn the first image, the dog is positioned more towards the left side, while in the second image, it is positioned more towards the right side. Although both images show the dog in action, there are some noticeable differences in the objects the dog is carrying and its surroundings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two images depict a dog in a yard with a fence and a house behind it. The first image shows the dog standing on the left side of the yard, while the second image shows the dog standing on the right side of the yard.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can identify the following differences between the two images:\n\n* In the first image, the dog is wearing a blue collar, whereas in the second image, there is no collar visible.\n* In the first image, the dog's ear is slightly raised, while in the second image, it is not.\n* In the first image, the dog's tail is down, whereas in the second image, it is up.\n* In the first image, there are three flowers in the yard, while in the second image, there are only two flowers.\n* In the first image, the bowl of food is on the left side of the yard, while in the second image, it is on the right side of the yard.\n* In the first image, the house is partially visible behind the fence, while in the second image, the house is fully visible behind the fence.\n* In the first image, the sky is blue with some clouds, while in the second image, the sky is clear blue.\n\nOverall, the two images show slight variations in the dog's position, the number of flowers, and the visibility of the house and bowl of food.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in dog's eye, collar, posture of the dog's leg, bowl contents, flower, stone, fence knot, grass near the fence, dog house window, and bush.",
