    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIs it possible for the player in the image to score points in the next 0.1 second?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSince the basketball player in the image is running with the ball, it is likely that he is attempting to score points in the next 0.1 second. However, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of his attempt without further information about the current game situation or his performance at that moment. The player's chances of scoring depend on factors such as the position of his teammates and opponents, his own skill level, and his ability to make quick decisions and execute the right moves.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a basketball player in a yellow uniform, with the number 23 on his jersey, running with the ball. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a crowd of spectators watching the game.\n\nTo determine if the player can score points in the next 0.1 second, we need to analyze the situation:\n\n1. The player is in possession of the ball, which means they have the opportunity to shoot or pass to a teammate.\n2. The player is running with the ball, which suggests they are trying to create space or get into a scoring position.\n3. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a crowded court, which could indicate that the player is under pressure from defenders.\n\nBased on these observations, it is possible that the player could score points in the next 0.1 second, but it depends on various factors such as:\n\n* The player's skill level and ability to make a shot or pass under pressure.\n* The positioning of the defenders and whether they can block the player's shot or intercept the pass.\n* The player's decision-making and ability to create a scoring opportunity.\n\nOverall, while it is possible for the player to score points in the next 0.1 second, it is not guaranteed and would depend on a combination of factors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the player's body and ball position suggest imminent scoring action.\n2. Determine proximity to the basket and potential defenders' positions.\n3. Evaluate movement direction and momentum for scoring likelihood: impossible",
