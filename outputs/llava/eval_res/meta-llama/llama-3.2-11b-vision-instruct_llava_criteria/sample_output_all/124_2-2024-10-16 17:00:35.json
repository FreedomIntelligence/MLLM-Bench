    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the woman's emotional state by examining her gaze and the placement of her hand, considering the potential symbolism of the blurred lights in the background.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman's gaze is directed to the left, with a downward tilt of her head, suggesting a somber or contemplative mood. Her eyes appear red and puffy, indicating that she may be crying or has recently been crying. The presence of tears on her cheeks further supports this interpretation.\n\nThe woman's hand is raised in front of her, with her palm facing outward, which could be a gesture of defense, frustration, or even a plea for help. The blurred lights in the background add a sense of depth and context to the scene, but their exact meaning is unclear. They could represent a busy cityscape, a crowded room, or even a symbol of hope or guidance.\n\nOverall, the woman's emotional state appears to be one of sadness, possibly accompanied by feelings of frustration or desperation. Her gaze and hand placement convey a sense of vulnerability and introspection, while the blurred lights in the background add a layer of complexity to the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a black veil and looking to her left side with tearful eyes. The hand that she is holding out appears to be in front of her face, which might indicate that she is blocking her face from the viewer or trying to conceal her emotions. This, in combination with the background where the lights are blurred, creates a somewhat mysterious and potentially symbolic atmosphere. It might suggest the woman is going through an emotional experience or dealing with a challenging situation, and the blurred lights could represent the confusion or the complexity of her emotions at that moment. The woman's gaze and her hand's position also suggest vulnerability, and the blurred lights in the background contribute to a sense of introspection and reflection on her emotions and experiences.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's emotional state  as sadness, regret, or perhaps a sense of longing.",
