    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat makes the image blurry?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is blurry because it was taken on a moving train, such as a subway train or a train passing down the tracks. The motion creates a sense of blurriness or visual uncertainty, as the train and its surroundings were not stationary during capture.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurry because the camera was moving while taking the picture. This can cause a range of issues, including:\n\n* Motion blur: The movement of the camera creates a blur effect on the image, making it difficult to discern details.\n* Lack of sharpness: The blur can also affect the sharpness of the image, making it appear soft or fuzzy.\n* Loss of detail: The motion blur can cause important details in the image to be lost, such as text or fine features.\n* Unstable composition: The blur can also affect the composition of the image, making it difficult to achieve a stable and balanced arrangement of elements.\n\nTo avoid these issues, it's important to use a tripod or other stabilizing device when taking pictures, especially in low-light conditions or when moving the camera. Additionally, using a faster shutter speed or a higher ISO can help to reduce motion blur and improve the overall quality of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the blur is due to low pixel count.\n2. Assess whether motion contributes to the image's blurriness.\n3. Evaluate if focus issues are causing the blur in the image.",
