    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the design and structure of the sofa and determine if it is possible that this sofa can be converted into a bed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe sofa in the image appears to be a sectional sofa with a chaise lounge on the left side. The chaise lounge is a separate piece that can be moved to create a bed. The back cushions are attached to the frame, and the seat cushions are removable. The sofa has a low profile and a tufted design, which suggests that it may be a convertible sofa.\n\nTo convert this sofa into a bed, you would need to remove the back cushions and the seat cushions, and then attach the chaise lounge to the wall or to another piece of furniture. You would also need to add a mattress or a bed frame to complete the conversion.\n\nIt is possible that this sofa can be converted into a bed, but it would require some assembly and customization. The design and structure of the sofa suggest that it is intended to be a versatile piece of furniture that can serve multiple purposes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe sofa in the image is a stretched, long white couch with a cushion placed on top of it, and a large, round decorative bowl in the center. While it is visually appealing and spacious, it is unlikely to be a convertible sofa. Convertible sofas usually have a hidden bed frame within the seating unit, allowing them to be transformed into a sleeping arrangement. Based on the image, the sofa does not appear to have such a frame, rendering it incapable of conversion into a bed. The couch seems to be designed for lounging, sitting, and socializing, rather than serving as a sleeping arrangement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible design elements indicating convertibility to a bed, such as removable backrests or extendable sections.\n2. Assess the sofa's structure for potential hidden mechanisms like fold-out frames or mattresses.\n3. Evaluate the size and proportions of the sofa to ascertain if it could feasibly accommodate a sleeping person.",
