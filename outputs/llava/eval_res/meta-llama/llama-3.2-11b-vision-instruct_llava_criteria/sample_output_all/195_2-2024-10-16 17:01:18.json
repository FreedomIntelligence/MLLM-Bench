    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the visual symptoms in detail and estimate the stage of the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a young child with a rash on their face. The rash is characterized by red, raised bumps that are scattered across the cheeks and forehead. The bumps are relatively small, ranging in size from 1-5mm in diameter. They are also quite close together, with some areas showing multiple bumps in a small space.\n\nThe child's skin tone is fair, and the rash stands out against this background. The rash does not appear to be itchy or painful, as the child's facial expression is neutral. The child is wearing a white tank top, which provides a clean and simple backdrop for the rash.\n\nIn terms of the stage of the condition, it is difficult to say for certain without more information. However, based on the appearance of the rash, it is possible that the child may be experiencing an allergic reaction or an autoimmune disorder. The rash could also be a sign of an infection, such as impetigo or eczema.\n\nTo determine the cause of the rash, further evaluation by a healthcare professional would be necessary. This could include a physical examination, medical history, and potentially laboratory tests such as a skin biopsy or blood work. Treatment would depend on the underlying cause of the rash and may involve topical or oral medications, as well as lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and prevent future episodes.\n\nOverall, while the image provides some clues about the nature of the rash, more information would be needed to accurately diagnose and treat the condition.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a young child is looking at the camera with red spots on their skin, particularly on their face. These red spots are likely indicative of a rash or an outbreak of hives. Hives are often caused by an allergic reaction, irritation, or an infection. It is difficult to precisely determine the stage of the condition from the image alone, as the severity, size, and distribution of the rash can vary. However, given that the child is looking at the camera, it is possible that the rash is not too severe or extensive, allowing the child to maintain focus and comfort in the presence of the photographer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe visible skin symptoms (e.g., rash, discoloration).\n2. Estimate condition stage based on visual symptoms severity.\n3. Include no diagnosis, focus on symptom description and stage estimation.",
