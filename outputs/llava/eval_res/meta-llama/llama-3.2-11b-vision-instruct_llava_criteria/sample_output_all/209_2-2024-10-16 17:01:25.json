    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssuming this is a moment after someone made a shot, will the basketball rise or fall in the next second?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe basketball will fall in the next second. The force of gravity will pull it down, and it will likely bounce off the rim or backboard before landing in the net.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn this image, the basketball is in midair inside the net of a basketball hoop. The next second, the ball is likely to drop, as it has momentarily passed through the hoop after the shot was made. Typically, when a basketball is successfully shot into the hoop, it will fall through the net and be considered a score. If the ball remains stuck in the net, it might indicate a missed shot or a rim violation. In the case of this image, the ball is falling after being in the net, so it is safe to assume that it has been scored.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the basketball will \"fall\".\n2. Explanation should demonstrate understanding of the basketball's trajectory and gravity.\n3. Response must infer the action based on the position of the basketball relative to the hoop.",
