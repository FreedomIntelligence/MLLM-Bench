    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBetween the two towel materials depicted in the picture, which one exhibits greater water absorbency when the towels are new?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nWhen the towels are new, the bamboo towels are likely to exhibit greater water absorbency compared to cotton towels. Bamboo is a natural, plant-based fiber that absorbs water more efficiently, which means it can dry faster and more effectively. Cotton towels, on the other hand, are known for their softness and comfort but may not absorb water as quickly or be as water-repellent as bamboo towels. However, please keep in mind that the actual water absorbency of these towels depends on factors like the towel's construction and quality, so the comparison is based on general trends.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows two types of towels: cotton and bamboo. The cotton towels are on the left side of the image, and the bamboo towels are on the right side. The cotton towels are a light gray color, while the bamboo towels are a cream color.\n\nCotton towels are known for their absorbency, but bamboo towels are also highly absorbent. Bamboo towels have a unique property that makes them more absorbent than cotton towels. Bamboo fibers have a higher water-holding capacity than cotton fibers, which means they can absorb more water without becoming soggy. This is because bamboo fibers have a higher density and a more open structure than cotton fibers, allowing them to hold more water molecules.\n\nIn addition, bamboo towels are also more breathable than cotton towels. Bamboo fibers have natural antimicrobial properties that prevent the growth of bacteria and mold, making them ideal for use in bathrooms where moisture is present. This means that bamboo towels can dry faster than cotton towels, reducing the risk of bacterial growth and unpleasant odors.\n\nOverall, both cotton and bamboo towels are highly absorbent, but bamboo towels have a slight advantage when it comes to water absorbency. However, it's important to note that the absorbency of a towel also depends on its thickness and material quality, so it's not just about the type of fiber used.\n\n*Answer*: Bamboo Towels\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference bamboo towels' greater water absorbency.\n2. Analyze absorbency based on towel materials, not appearance.",
