    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCreate a dense caption for each visible book, including its title, author's name, and any discernible design elements such as color, font style, and imagery on the book spines.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n1.

An illustrated person on the front cover.\n\nThe books are stacked vertically, with varying heights.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a stack of books on a white table, with the spines facing outward. The books are arranged in a random order, with some titles and authors visible. Here is a list of the books in the stack, along with their titles, authors, and any discernible design elements:\n\n1. **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel\n\t* Cover color: Orange\n\t* Font style: Blue and black sans-serif font\n\t* Imagery: None visible\n2. **Ego is the Enemy** by Ryan Holiday\n\t* Cover color: Red\n\t* Font style: White sans-serif font\n\t* Imagery: None visible\n3. **The Obstacle is the Way** by Ryan Holiday\n\t* Cover color: White\n\t* Font style: Black serif font\n\t* Imagery: A small logo or symbol in the top-right corner\n4. **Exponential Organizations** by Ismail, Malone, and Van Geest\n\t* Cover color: Black\n\t* Font style: White sans-serif font\n\t* Imagery: None visible\n5. **Competing Against Luck** by Clayton M.

The design elements on the book spines are simple and straightforward, with most using a combination of color and font style to convey the tone and style of the book.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
