    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss how the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a man dressed in a colorful, oversized jester costume, complete with a pointed hat and a sign that reads \"Mostly Harmless.\" The costume is adorned with various accessories, including a large metal mug, a string of beads, and a ring on the man's finger. The man's expression is one of mischief and playfulness, with a hint of mischief in his eyes.\n\n**Character Analysis**\n\nThe combination of the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression works together to create a comedic character. The oversized costume and hat give the impression of a clown or a fool, while the sign \"Mostly Harmless\" suggests that the character is not to be taken too seriously. The ring on the man's finger adds a touch of elegance to the overall look, which contrasts with the more playful and ridiculous elements of the costume.\n\n**Comedic Effect**\n\nThe image is likely intended to be humorous, with the character's playful expression and the absurdity of the costume and accessories creating a comedic effect. The use of bright colors and exaggerated features adds to the overall sense of playfulness and silliness, making the image amusing and entertaining.\n\n**Overall Impression**\n\nOverall, the image presents a lighthearted and humorous character, one who is likely to bring a smile to the viewer's face. The combination of the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression creates a comedic character that is both playful and entertaining.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character through various elements that contribute to the overall effect. The man is wearing a clown costume, which already has a humorous and exaggerated look. He is also dressed like a jester, further emphasizing the comedic nature of his appearance. Additionally, he is wearing a funny hat and a beard, adding to the overall goofy and lighthearted vibe of the character.\n\nThe individual's expression contributes to the comedic effect of the scene. He is making a funny face, likely indicating that he is posing for a joke or entertaining others. His wide open eyes and the playful pose make the character even more amusing.\n\nLastly, the man is holding a cup or a metal mug, which could be used as a prop for his humorous act or a drink for a celebration. All these elements work together to create a comedic character that is visually entertaining and engaging.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
