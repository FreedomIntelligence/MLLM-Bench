    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a room that appears to be a bedroom, with a desk and chair in the corner. The desk is situated in the center of the room, near the window, and has a lamp on top of it. There is also a bookshelf above the desk, which contains various items such as books, papers, and office supplies.\n\nBased on the furniture and layout of the room, I would argue that this is not a suitable location for an office space. Here's why:\n\n* The room is small and cramped, with limited space to move around. This would make it difficult to work comfortably and efficiently.\n* The desk is located in a corner, which can create a sense of isolation and make it harder to collaborate with others.\n* The room lacks natural light, as the window is covered by blinds and the room is located in a corner. This can lead to eye strain and decreased productivity.\n* There are no other workstations or meeting areas in the room, which would limit the number of people who could work there at any given time.\n\nOverall, while the room has some potential as a workspace, it is not ideal due to its small size, lack of natural light, and limited functionality. A more suitable location for an office space would likely be a larger room with plenty of natural light, multiple workstations, and meeting areas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
