    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe meme is a humorous take on the common stereotype that people who hate dogs are often seen as being aggressive or violent. The image shows a man and woman in a car, with the woman saying \"Oh look at that dog\" and the man responding \"I hate dogs.\" The punchline comes when the man is shown driving a car with a large dog in the passenger seat, and the woman is visibly upset in the backseat. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical reaction to seeing a dog, and the absurdity of the situation.\n\nThe type of humor employed in this meme is irony, as it subverts the expectation of how someone who hates dogs would react to seeing one. It also uses exaggeration, as the man's hatred of dogs is taken to an extreme level by having him drive a car with a large dog in the passenger seat. Overall, the meme uses a lighthearted and playful approach to poke fun at the stereotype of dog haters.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
