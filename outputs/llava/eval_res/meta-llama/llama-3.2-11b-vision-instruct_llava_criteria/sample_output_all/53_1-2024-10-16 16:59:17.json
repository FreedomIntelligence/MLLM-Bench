    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe Sydney Opera House, an iconic landmark in Australia, is renowned for its distinctive architectural style and design. The building's design was conceived by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won an international design competition for the project in 1957. The Opera House features a series of interlocking arches that resemble the sails of a ship, with each arch covered in a different color of tiles. The exterior of the building is clad in over 2,194 pre-cast concrete sections, which are arranged in a pattern of interlocking triangles. The interior of the building is equally impressive, with a large concert hall, a smaller theater, and several studios and rehearsal rooms. The design of the Sydney Opera House was influenced by Utzon's interest in the principles of harmony and balance, as well as his desire to create a building that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The result is a unique and striking building that has become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the landmark as Sydney Opera House and its architectural style accurately.\n2. Describe the design concept or inspiration behind the architecture.\n3. Mention the architect's possible design approach or philosophy.",
