Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is this short-haired woman's occupation?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe short-haired woman's occupation is a nurse.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, it appears that the short-haired woman is a medical professional, likely a doctor or nurse, as she is wearing a white lab coat and has a stethoscope around her neck. She is also standing in a medical setting, possibly a doctor's office or hospital room, which further supports this conclusion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
