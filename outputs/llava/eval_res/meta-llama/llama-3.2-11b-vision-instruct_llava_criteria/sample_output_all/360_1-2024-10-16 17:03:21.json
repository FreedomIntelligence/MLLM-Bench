    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a story based on the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, we see a dog sitting on a mat, surrounded by an airplane and airplane toys. The dog seems to be resting and enjoying the cozy airplane-inspired bed. There are books scattered around the room, indicating that this space might be used for play, relaxation, or learning.\n\nIt's possible that the dog's owner is nearby, engaged in some activity or enjoying a meal, as there are two carrots visible on the floor, likely meant for sharing with the dog. A cup can also be seen on the floor, suggesting that the person might be having a drink while spending time with the dog.\n\nAs we look closer at the scene, we notice that the dog is carrying a book, adding a playful touch to the scene. The books' presence, along with the airplane toys, creates an imaginative and creative environment for the dog and its owner to enjoy.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a child's bedroom, with a boy lying in bed and a dog sitting on the floor. The boy is surrounded by toys and books, and there is a thought bubble above his head that shows him solving a math problem with the help of the dog.\n\nHere is a story based on the image:\n\nTitle: The Math Whiz\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a boy named Max who loved to learn. He spent most of his free time reading books and doing puzzles, and he was especially good at math. One day, Max was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, but he couldn't stop thinking about a math problem he had been working on earlier that day.\n\nAs he lay there, he started to think about how he could solve the problem. He thought about all the different ways he could approach it, and he even started to see patterns and connections between different numbers. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head, and he knew exactly how to solve the problem.\n\nBut just as he was about to drift off to sleep, Max's dog, Buddy, jumped up onto the bed and started barking excitedly. Max laughed and scratched Buddy behind the ears, and then he looked up at the thought bubble above his head.\n\nIn the thought bubble, Max saw himself sitting at a desk, with Buddy sitting next to him. They were both wearing glasses and looking very serious. Max was holding a pencil and paper, and he was writing down numbers and symbols. Buddy was watching him intently, and Max could swear that he saw a look of understanding on the dog's face.\n\nMax smiled to himself, feeling proud of how far he had come. He knew that he still had a lot to learn, but he was confident that he could solve any math problem that came his way. With a happy heart, Max closed his eyes and fell fast asleep, with Buddy snuggled up beside him.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes boy dreaming about math, dog attending school, and bedroom setting.\n2. Narrative coherence; beginning, middle, and end structured around the image.\n3. Creative elements that enhance the visual elements without altering them.",
