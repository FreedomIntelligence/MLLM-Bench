    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is a meme that features a cat curled up in a ball, with its head buried in its paws. The caption reads \"Mondays...\" in bold white letters.\n\nThe humor in this image comes from the fact that the cat is depicted as being depressed or sad on a Monday, which is a common sentiment among people who dread the start of the workweek. The use of a cat as the protagonist adds to the humor, as cats are often seen as independent and aloof animals that don't typically exhibit human-like emotions.\n\nThe image also plays on the idea that Mondays can be a gloomy and miserable day, and the cat's posture and facial expression reinforce this notion. The use of the word \"Mondays...\" in all capital letters adds to the emphasis on the cat's misery, implying that it's not just any ordinary Monday but a particularly bad one.\n\nOverall, the humor in this image comes from the relatable sentiment of dreading Mondays, combined with the unexpected use of a cat as the protagonist and the exaggerated expression of misery.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
