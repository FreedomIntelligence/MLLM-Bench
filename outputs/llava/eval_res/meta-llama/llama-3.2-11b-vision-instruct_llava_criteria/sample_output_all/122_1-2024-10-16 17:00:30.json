    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the possible emotional dynamics of the coupleâ€™s interaction based on their seating posture and orientation towards each other.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the man is holding the woman in his arms while she is smiling. The woman is sitting on the man's shoulders with pink flowers in her hand. The couple's interaction suggests a sense of joy, closeness, and affection between them. Their seating posture and orientation towards each other indicate a playful and intimate connection, possibly indicating that they are enjoying a special moment together, such as a romantic outing, a celebration, or simply spending quality time with one another. The presence of pink flowers adds a touch of warmth, love, and happiness to the scene, further emphasizing the positive emotions and bond between the couple.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe couple's interaction in the image suggests a strong emotional connection and playfulness. The woman's open-mouthed smile and the man's closed-mouth smile, which is still visible, indicate that they are both happy and relaxed in each other's company. The woman's hand on the man's shoulder and the man's hand holding the flower suggest a sense of closeness and affection. The fact that the woman is leaning on the man's back and he is supporting her weight implies a sense of trust and vulnerability. Overall, the image conveys a sense of warmth, intimacy, and joy, suggesting that the couple is comfortable with each other and enjoying each other's company.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions suggested by facial expressions and body language as happiness, or similar.",
