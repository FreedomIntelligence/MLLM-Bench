    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the device in the picture and describe the functionality and usage of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a device known as an electric screwdriver, which is being used to drill into metal. Electric screwdrivers are typically used in a wide range of professional settings for applications such as screwing or drilling in metal or similar materials. They offer a more convenient and efficient alternative to traditional manual tools, as they can deliver consistent and precise torque with a button press. The electric screwdriver can be especially useful for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as drilling screws into sheet metal, assembly, and disassembly tasks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe device in the picture is a large, industrial-grade laser cutter or engraver. It is likely used for cutting and engraving various materials such as metal, wood, plastic, and glass. The device is equipped with a high-powered laser beam that is directed onto the material to be cut or engraved, allowing for precise and accurate cuts or engravings.\n\nThe device is typically used in manufacturing, prototyping, and artistic applications where precise and detailed cuts or engravings are required. It is commonly used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and consumer electronics, as well as in artistic fields like sculpture and jewelry making.\n\nThe device is typically operated by a computer program that controls the movement of the laser beam and the cutting or engraving process. The user can input the desired design or pattern into the computer, and the device will follow the instructions to create the desired cut or engraving.\n\nOverall, the device in the picture is a powerful tool for creating complex and precise cuts or engravings on various materials, and is widely used in various industries and artistic applications.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the device as a linear rail system.\n2. Describe the linear rail system's functionality accurately.\n3. Explain the usage of the linear rail system in context.",
