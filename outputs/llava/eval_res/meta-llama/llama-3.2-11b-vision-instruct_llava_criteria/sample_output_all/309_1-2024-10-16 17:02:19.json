    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the container in the top left corner in the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, will people likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle containing boiling water at 100°C without using proper protective measures like oven mitts or a thick towel. The hot water can cause burns to their hands, especially if the bottle is made of a heat-conductive material, such as plastic. It is important to handle hot containers with care and use appropriate protective equipment to avoid accidents and injuries.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe container in the top left corner of the picture is a Starbucks tumbler, which is designed to keep drinks hot or cold for hours. It is made of double-walled insulation that helps to keep the temperature of the drink inside. \n\nIf the tumbler was filled with boiling water at 100°C, it would be very hot to the touch and could cause burns if someone were to hold it without protection. However, the tumbler is designed to keep the temperature of the drink inside, so it is unlikely that the outside of the tumbler would be hot enough to cause burns. \n\nIt is important to note that even if the tumbler is not hot to the touch, the contents of the tumbler could still be very hot and could cause burns if someone were to drink from it without waiting for it to cool down. It is always important to exercise caution when handling hot beverages and to wait for them to cool down before consuming them.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference the insulated nature of the bottle and the unlikelihood of scalding.\n2. Include reasoning on the physical properties of insulation.",
