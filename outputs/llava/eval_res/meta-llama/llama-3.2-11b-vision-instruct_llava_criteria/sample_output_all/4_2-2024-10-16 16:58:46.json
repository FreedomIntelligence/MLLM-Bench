    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features an AV Access device, a compact, dark gray, square-shaped device with a flat top and rounded edges, situated atop an iPad.\n\nThe AV Access device has several ports on its front, including:\n\n* USB-C port (left)\n* USB-A port (center-left)\n* SD card slot (center)\n* USB-C port (center-right)\n* USB-A port (right)\n* Power button (center-right)\n* Headphone jack (bottom right)\n\nThese ports allow the user to connect various peripherals to the device, such as keyboards, mice, and external hard drives. The device's design enables it to be easily connected to an iPad or other mobile device for enhanced functionality.\n\nThe iPad is positioned underneath the AV Access device, with its screen facing upwards and displaying the word \"iPad\" in white text. The iPad's screen is slightly blurred, suggesting that the image is a product photo or advertisement for the AV Access device.\n\nIn the background, a person is visible, sitting at a desk and working on a computer. The person's hands are not visible, but their arm and torso are clearly shown. The background is out of focus, but it appears to be a well-lit office or workspace.\n\nOverall, the image effectively showcases the AV Access device and its various ports, highlighting its versatility and functionality. The inclusion of the iPad and the person in the background adds context to the device's intended use and purpose.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
