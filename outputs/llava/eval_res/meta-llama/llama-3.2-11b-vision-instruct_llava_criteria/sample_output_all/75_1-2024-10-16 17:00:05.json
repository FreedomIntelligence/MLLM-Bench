    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\n Infer the type of educational activity taking place and its subject.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe educational activity taking place is a group seminar or tutorial, possibly involving math or financial analysis. The man standing and talking at the whiteboard with a marker indicates that he is teaching or explaining the subject matter to the students seated at the table with laptops in front of them. The presence of potted plants in the room suggests a casual and comfortable learning environment. This suggests that the educational activity focuses on collaboration, discussion, and active learning, where students can work together to explore and understand the subject matter more effectively.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a classroom scene, with a teacher standing at the front and students seated at tables. The teacher is writing on a whiteboard, while the students are engaged in listening to the lesson. The room is well-lit, with natural light coming from the windows and artificial lighting from the ceiling.\n\n**Subject:**\nThe subject of the lesson appears to be mathematics, as indicated by the equations and formulas written on the whiteboard. The teacher's attire, consisting of a gray t-shirt and shorts, suggests a casual yet professional approach to teaching.\n\n**Activity:**\nThe educational activity taking place is likely a lecture or discussion on a mathematical concept, given the presence of equations and formulas on the whiteboard. The students seem to be actively engaged in the lesson, with some taking notes and others asking questions.\n\n**Classroom Environment:**\nThe classroom environment is modern and well-equipped, with comfortable seating for the students and a large whiteboard for the teacher to write on. The room is also equipped with a projector and screen, suggesting that multimedia resources may be used during the lesson.\n\n**Teacher's Role:**\nThe teacher appears to be an expert in the subject matter, with a clear and concise teaching style. They are using visual aids such as the whiteboard to help illustrate complex concepts, and are encouraging student participation through questions and discussions.\n\n**Student Engagement:**\nThe students seem to be highly engaged in the lesson, with some actively participating in discussions and others taking notes. The relaxed atmosphere of the classroom suggests that the students feel comfortable and supported in their learning environment.\n\n**Overall:**\nThe image suggests a well-structured and engaging educational activity, with a focus on mathematical concepts and problem-solving. The teacher's expertise and the students' engagement create a positive and productive learning environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify educational activity (lecture, workshop, etc.) and verify presence of instructional materials (whiteboard, digital screen).\n2. Determine the subject being taught (mathematics, science, etc.) based on visible content (equations, diagrams).\n3. Evaluate clarity in describing the setting and participants' roles (teacher, students).",
