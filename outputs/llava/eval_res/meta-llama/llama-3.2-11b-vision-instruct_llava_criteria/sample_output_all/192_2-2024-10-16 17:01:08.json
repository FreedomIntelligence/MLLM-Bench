    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**CT Report:**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n\n* Name: [Not provided]\n* Age: [Not provided]\n* Sex: [Not provided]\n\n**Scan Details:**\n\n* Modality: CT Scan\n* Slice thickness: 5 mm\n* Reconstruction algorithm: Soft tissue window\n* Slice location: Axial\n\n**Findings:**\n\n* A large, well-defined, heterogeneous mass is observed in the left cerebral hemisphere.\n* The mass measures approximately 6 x 5 x 4 cm in size.\n* The mass is isodense to hyperdense compared to the surrounding brain parenchyma.\n* The mass exhibits heterogeneous enhancement with contrast administration.\n* The mass is causing significant mass effect, with midline shift to the right and compression of the left lateral ventricle.\n* There is also evidence of hydrocephalus, with dilatation of the temporal horns and trigone of the lateral ventricles.\n* The mass is located in the region of the left frontal lobe, near the motor cortex.\n* There is no evidence of calcification or hemorrhage within the mass.\n\n**Impression:**\n\n* The findings are consistent with a large, potentially malignant brain tumor, likely a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).\n* Further diagnostic workup, including MRI and biopsy, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the tumor.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* The patient should be referred to a neurosurgeon for possible surgical resection of the tumor.\n* The patient should also be referred to a medical oncologist for chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n* Follow-up imaging should be performed to monitor the response to treatment and assess for any signs of recurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
