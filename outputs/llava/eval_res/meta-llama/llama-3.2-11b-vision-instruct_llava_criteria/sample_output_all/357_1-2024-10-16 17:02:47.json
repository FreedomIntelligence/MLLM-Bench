    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze this photograph for authenticity, focusing on the lighting, shadows, and reflections. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe photograph appears to be a digitally rendered image or a computer graphic display of five people sitting under umbrellas. The lighting in the scene gives the image a strong shaded and realistic appearance. The shadows and reflections of the people and umbrellas create a sense of depth and dimension. The shadows are well-defined and appear to be consistent with the time of day, as they are not overly harsh or unrealistically dark. Based on these observations, the image seems to be an authentic representation of the scene, although it has the appearance of a computer-generated graphic or a digitally rendered photo.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis image presents an aerial view of a serene outdoor setting, featuring a group of individuals seated on chairs arranged in a circle around a vibrant green body of water. The group consists of seven people, with three positioned near the water's edge and four further away, all facing the water.\n\nThe individuals are dressed in various attire, including a blue shirt, a pink shirt, a black shirt, a green shirt, a striped shirt, and a white shirt. Each person is seated in a chair with a slatted back, casting a distinct shadow on the ground. The chairs are situated on a beige concrete surface, which surrounds the green body of water.\n\nThree white umbrellas stand upright near the water's edge, while the surrounding environment is characterized by a large expanse of green water, a concrete border, and a beige concrete surface. The overall atmosphere of the image exudes relaxation and tranquility, with the group of individuals appearing to be engaged in leisurely activities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess consistency of shadows with the apparent light source direction.\n2. Verify reflections and refractions for naturalness and accuracy.\n3. Examine lighting for realistic interaction with the scene and subjects.",
