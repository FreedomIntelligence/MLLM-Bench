    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the upper side and lower side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the upper side of the image, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones, whereas in the lower side, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones. However, the differences between the two images include the poses of the people and the layout of the table. The people in the upper image are in different poses and are not all in the same positions as in the lower image. There is also a bottle visible in both images, but its placement on the table is different. Additionally, the presence of a dining table and chairs is common to both images, but the design or style of the table and chairs may differ.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image on the upper side shows a group of people sitting around a table, each with their own laptop and drink. The image on the lower side is identical to the upper side, except for the following differences:\n\n*   The person in the orange dress is holding a tablet instead of a laptop.\n*   The person in the green shirt is holding a laptop instead of a tablet.\n*   The person in the yellow shirt is holding a laptop instead of a tablet.\n*   The person in the brown shirt is holding a laptop instead of a tablet.\n*   The person in the white shirt is holding a tablet instead of a laptop.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 differences between the two images.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in logo direction, object colors in hand, right foot direction, hair style, and chair legs.",
