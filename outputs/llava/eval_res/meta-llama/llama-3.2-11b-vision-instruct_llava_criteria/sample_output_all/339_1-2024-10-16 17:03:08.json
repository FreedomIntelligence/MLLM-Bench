    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe screen of the computer appears to be damaged, with visible cracks and shards of glass. This type of damage is often caused by physical impact or accidental drops, which can cause the glass to shatter and the LCD panel to malfunction.\n\nTo repair this damage, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. **Assess the extent of the damage**: Before attempting any repairs, it's essential to assess the extent of the damage to determine the best course of action. If the damage is minor, it may be possible to repair the screen without replacing it entirely.\n2. **Clean the area around the screen**: Use a soft cloth and a gentle cleaning solution to remove any debris or dust from the area around the screen. This will help prevent further damage and make it easier to work on the screen.\n3. **Remove any loose shards of glass**: Use tweezers or a small brush to carefully remove any loose shards of glass from the screen. Be careful not to touch the LCD panel, as this can cause further damage.\n4. **Apply a screen protector or repair kit**: If the damage is minor, a screen protector or repair kit may be able to fix the issue. These products are designed to cover the entire screen and provide additional protection against future damage.\n5. **Replace the screen**: If the damage is more extensive, it may be necessary to replace the screen entirely. This can be done by purchasing a replacement screen from the manufacturer or a third-party supplier and following the manufacturer's instructions for installation.\n6. **Seek professional help**: If you are not comfortable attempting to repair the screen yourself, it's recommended to seek the help of a professional. They will have the necessary tools and expertise to properly diagnose and repair the issue.\n\nIt's important to note that attempting to repair a damaged screen can be challenging and may require specialized tools and expertise.
