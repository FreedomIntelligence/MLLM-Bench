Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the texture of the skin of fruits in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**Texture Comparison of Fruit Skins**\n\nThe image features two fruits: an apple and an orange. \n\n*   **Apple Skin:** The apple's skin is smooth, with a slightly waxy texture. It has a subtle sheen, indicating a moderate level of moisture retention. The skin is thin and delicate, with a slight give when pressed. \n*   **Orange Skin:** In contrast, the orange's skin is rougher and more textured. It has a thicker, more pronounced pebbled appearance, which suggests a higher water content. The skin is also slightly more resilient to pressure, indicating its tougher nature.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   The apple's skin is smoother and thinner than the orange's.\n*   The orange's skin is rougher and more textured, with a higher water content.\n*   The apple's skin is more delicate and has a slight give when pressed, while the orange's skin is more resilient.\n\nOverall, the texture of the fruit skins in the image reflects their natural characteristics and properties.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the apple has a smooth, glossy skin, while the orange has a rough, slightly textured skin.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention apple's smooth, glossy skin and orange's dimpled, pebbled texture.",
