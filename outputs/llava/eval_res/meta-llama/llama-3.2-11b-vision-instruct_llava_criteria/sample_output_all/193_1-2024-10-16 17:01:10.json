    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the type of cells pointed by labeled arrows.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows cells with labeled arrows pointing to them, likely indicating specific features or characteristics of the cells. However, without additional context or specific descriptions of the cells, it is difficult to definitively determine the type of cells pointed by the labeled arrows. The cells could be red blood cells, white blood cells, or any other type of cell in the context of a microscope slide.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Step 1: Identify the cells pointed by labeled arrows.**\n\n*   A: Red blood cells\n*   B: Neutrophil\n*   C: Lymphocyte\n*   D: Eosinophil\n*   E: Platelet\n*   F: Monocyte\n*   G: Basophil\n*   H: RBC fragment\n\n**Step 2: Determine the type of cells pointed by labeled arrows.**\n\n*   A: Red blood cells\n*   B: Neutrophil\n*   C: Lymphocyte\n*   D: Eosinophil\n*   E: Platelet\n*   F: Monocyte\n*   G: Basophil\n*   H: RBC fragment\n\n**Answer:** A: Red blood cells, B: Neutrophil, C: Lymphocyte, D: Eosinophil, E: Platelet, F: Monocyte, G: Basophil, H: RBC fragment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify and match each labeled arrow (A-H) with the cell types from the reference.\n2. Answer must specify the type of cell for each label without ambiguity or error.",
