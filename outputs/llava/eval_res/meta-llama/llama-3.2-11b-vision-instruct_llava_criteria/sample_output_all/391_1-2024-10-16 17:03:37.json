    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Current Design Trends in Automotive Industry**\n\nThe current design trends in the automotive industry can be inferred from the image of the presidential automobiles. The image shows a collection of cars from various eras, including the 1909 White Model M Steam Car, the 1912 Baker Electric, the 1916 Cadillac Series 53, the 1919 Pierce-Arrow Series 51 Limousine, the 1921 Packard Twin 6, the 1928 Cadillac Series 341 Town Car, the 1932 Cadillac 452B V-16 Fleetwood Imperial, the 1938 Cadillac V-16 \"Queen Mary\" & \"Queen Elizabeth\", the 1939 Lincoln K-Series \"Sunshine Special\", the 1942 Lincoln Custom, and the 1950 Lincoln Cosmopolitan.\n\n**Design Elements**\n\nUpon examining the image, several design elements are evident:\n\n*   **Body Style**: The cars have a mix of body styles, including sedans, limousines, and convertibles.\n*   **Wheels**: The wheels are typically round with a hubcap, and some cars have wire spokes.\n*   **Windows**: Most cars have rectangular windows, but some have curved or rounded windows.\n*   **Grills**: The grills are often made of metal and have a decorative pattern.\n*   **Headlights**: The headlights are usually round and mounted on the front of the car.\n*   **Taillights**: The taillights are often rectangular and mounted on the back of the car.\n*   **Trunk**: Some cars have a trunk lid, while others do not.\n*   **Roof**: Some cars have a convertible roof, while others have a fixed roof.\n\n**Future Design Evolution**\n\nBased on these design elements, it can be inferred that future automotive design evolution will likely involve:\n\n*   **Sustainability**: With increasing concerns about climate change and environmental sustainability, future cars may be designed with more eco-friendly materials and features, such as electric or hybrid engines, solar panels, and recycled materials.\n*   **Autonomy**: As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, cars may be designed with advanced safety features, such as sensors and cameras, and may have a more streamlined shape to reduce wind resistance.\n*   **Connectivity**: Future cars may be designed with advanced connectivity features, such as 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, to enable seamless communication and data transfer between vehicles and the internet.\n*   **Personalization**: With the rise of personalized transportation, future cars may be designed with customizable features, such as adjustable seats, climate control, and infotainment systems, to cater to individual preferences.\n*   **Safety**: Future cars may be designed with advanced safety features, such as airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and lane departure warning systems, to improve road safety.\n\nOverall, the current design trends in the automotive industry suggest that future cars will be designed with a focus on sustainability, autonomy, connectivity, personalization, and safety.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
