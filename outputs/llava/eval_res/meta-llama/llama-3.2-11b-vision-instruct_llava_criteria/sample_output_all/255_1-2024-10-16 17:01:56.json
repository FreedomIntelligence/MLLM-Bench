    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image showcases a diverse array of big cats, each with its unique characteristics. The top left corner features a tiger, easily recognizable by its orange and black striped fur, long tail, and powerful physique. In contrast, the top right corner displays a lioness, distinguished by her golden coat, shorter tail, and more slender build compared to the male lions.\n\nMoving clockwise, the bottom right corner presents a lion, identified by its majestic mane, golden fur, and robust build. The bottom left corner illustrates a lioness, characterized by her shorter tail and more slender physique compared to the male lions. Notably, the lioness in this corner is depicted with a cub, highlighting the nurturing aspect of lion behavior.\n\nThese distinct features underscore the diversity within the big cat family, emphasizing the unique characteristics of each species. The illustration provides a comprehensive visual representation of these differences, allowing for a deeper understanding of the biology and behavior of these magnificent animals.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
