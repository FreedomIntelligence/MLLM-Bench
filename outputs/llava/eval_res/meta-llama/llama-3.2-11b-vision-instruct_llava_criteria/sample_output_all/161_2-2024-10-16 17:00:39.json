Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, summarize the abstract in one sentence and explain the significance of this article.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis article presents a paper that aims to democratize ChatGPT across languages by releasing a large language model called \"Phoenix\" that can achieve competitive performance among open-source English and Chinese models while excelling in languages with limited resources, making it more accessible to people in countries where ChatGPT is restricted.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe abstract describes a paper that highlights the importance of democratizing chatbot development by incorporating multiple languages, including English and Chinese, to allow chatbots to communicate with users across diverse linguistic backgrounds. This can be achieved by using innovative models such as Phoenix, which can enhance the performance of chatbots while reducing the learning time required. The significance of this article lies in promoting the use of chatbots in various languages, thus providing universal access and fostering global connections.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Summarize the abstract in one sentence, mentioning 'Phoenix', 'democratize ChatGPT', and 'languages'.\n2.
