Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the event in the image and classify the cultural significance of event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image displays a bullfighting event where a man is holding a pink cape, and another man is holding a red cloth. Bullfighting is a traditional spectacle that originated in Spain and later spread to other countries. It primarily involves a matador handling a bull using a cape and a sword. The event has cultural significance as it often represents courage, strength, and skill on the part of the matador. The specific colors of the cape (pink) and the cloth (red) in the image add to the visual appeal and symbolism of this traditional spectacle.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe event in the image is a bullfight, a traditional Spanish spectacle where a matador, dressed in a colorful costume, engages in a ritualized battle with a bull. The matador's primary goal is to outmaneuver the bull and ultimately kill it with a sword.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nBullfighting holds significant cultural importance in Spain, where it has been a part of the country's heritage for centuries. It is often seen as a symbol of Spanish identity and tradition, and is deeply rooted in the country's history and folklore.\n\n**Controversy and Criticism**\n\nHowever, bullfighting is also widely criticized for its perceived cruelty and inhumane treatment of animals. Many animal welfare organizations argue that the event is nothing more than a form of entertainment that involves the exploitation and suffering of animals.\n\n**Evolution and Future of Bullfighting**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement to ban bullfighting in Spain, with some regions already prohibiting the practice. Despite this, bullfighting remains a popular event in many parts of the country, and its cultural significance continues to be debated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cultural significance of bullfighting in Spain is complex and multifaceted, reflecting both the country's rich history and its ongoing debates about animal welfare.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
