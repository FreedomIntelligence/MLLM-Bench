    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide insights into how the data presented in the image could be indicative of the economic dynamics within the Islamic financial sector.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a bar graph showing the number of issues and financial value of the Islamic market in 2021. The Islamic market is growing rapidly, with the total number of issues being at 145 billion USD over the past year. This demonstrates the increasing interest in and demand for Islamic finance within the global financial sector. With countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and others making significant investments in this sector, it is evident that the Islamic market is becoming more prominent and influential in the global financial landscape. This implies that the Islamic financial sector is gaining acceptance and attracting more attention from investors, governments, and businesses, which will further contribute to its growth and development in the years to come.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The image in question likely contains a variety of financial metrics, such as profit margins, growth rates, market share, or investment returns. The economic dynamics within the Islamic financial sector are unique due to the adherence to Shariah law, which prohibits interest (riba), excessive uncertainty (gharar), and investments in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles. If the data shows a consistent increase in profit margins, this could indicate a growing demand for Shariah-compliant financial products. A rise in market share could suggest that Islamic banks are becoming more competitive against conventional banks, possibly due to their ethical investment strategies and risk-sharing principles that appeal to a broader customer base. High growth rates may reflect the sector's resilience during economic downturns, as Islamic finance has been noted for its stability during financial crises. Investment returns that align with ethical investments could signal a shift in consumer preferences towards socially responsible investing. The data might also reveal the impact of global economic conditions on Islamic finance, as it often avoids industries that are volatile or considered unethical. Overall, the data could demonstrate the sector's robustness and its potential for sustainable growth, which is attractive to investors who are looking for ethical investment opportunities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify proportions of Sukuk and other financial instruments in Islamic market value.\n2. Compare MENA region issuances to other regions in 2022.\n3. Analyze country-specific data for economic insights within MENA.",
