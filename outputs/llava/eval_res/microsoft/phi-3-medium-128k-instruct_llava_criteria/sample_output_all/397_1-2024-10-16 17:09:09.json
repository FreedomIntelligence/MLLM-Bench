    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the data shown in the table, predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo make a prediction, we need to apply linear regression to the data. However, there is no apparent data regarding the capital expenditure in the table. The table displays information related to cash flows in 2020, but it does not show the capital expenditure. Without proper data on capital expenditure, it is not possible to apply linear regression for predicting the capital expenditure in 2023.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To predict the capital expenditure of the company in 2023 using linear regression, we first need the data from the table. Assuming you have provided the data, here's a step-by-step process to predict the capital expenditure using linear regression:\n\n1. Organize the data: Arrange the capital expenditure data in a table with two columns: Year and Capital Expenditure.\n\n2. Plot the data: Create a scatter plot with Year on the x-axis and Capital Expenditure on the y-axis. This will help visualize the relationship between the two variables.\n\n3. Determine the linear regression equation: Linear regression aims to find the best-fit line through the data points. The equation for a linear regression line is y = mx + b, where y represents the dependent variable (Capital Expenditure), x represents the independent variable (Year), m represents the slope of the line, and b represents the y-intercept.\n\n4. Calculate the slope (m) and y-intercept (b): Use the least-squares method to calculate the slope and y-intercept. The formulas are:\n\n   m = (N * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (N * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)\n   b = (Σy - m * Σx) / N\n\n   where N is the number of data points, Σ(xy) is the sum of the products of x and y, Σx is the sum of x values, Σy is the sum of y values, and Σ(x^2) is the sum of the squares of x values.\n\n5. Plug in the values: Once you have the slope (m) and y-intercept (b), plug in the value for the year 2023 into the linear regression equation to predict the capital expenditure.\n\n6. Interpret the result: The predicted capital expenditure for the year 2023 is the value you obtained in step 5.\n\nPlease provide the data from the table, and I can help you with the calculations.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted value should be based on \"depreciation and amortization\" figures from 2020 to 2022.\n2. Answer must include a specific numerical prediction for 2023 capital expenditure.\n3. Prediction should be derived using linear regression on the provided data points.",
