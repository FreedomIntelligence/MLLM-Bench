    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The image depicts three headlines: \"Unprecedented Victory for the People!\", \"A Historic Day for Our Nation!\", and \"A New Dawn of Hope and Progress!\".\n\nThe emotive language used in these headlines is intended to evoke a sense of excitement, pride, and optimism in the reader. Here's a breakdown of the emotive language used in each headline:\n\n1. \"Unprecedented Victory for the People!\": The word \"unprecedented\" suggests that the victory achieved is groundbreaking and unprecedented, which can elicit a sense of awe and admiration in the reader. \"Victory\" implies a triumph or success, which can create a feeling of pride and accomplishment. The use of the word \"people\" emphasizes the collective nature of the victory, which can foster a sense of unity and camaraderie among the readers.\n\n2. \"A Historic Day for Our Nation!\": The word \"historic\" implies that the day being described is significant and will be remembered for years to come, which can generate feelings of excitement and anticipation in the reader. \"Our nation\" creates a sense of belonging and shared identity, which can foster a feeling of patriotism and pride in the reader.\n\n3. \"A New Dawn of Hope and Progress!\": The phrase \"new dawn\" suggests a fresh start or a new beginning, which can create a sense of optimism and hope in the reader. \"Hope\" is a powerful emotion, and its use here can inspire the reader to believe in the possibility of positive change. \"Progress\" implies forward movement and improvement, which can create a sense of excitement and anticipation for the future.\n\nThe potential impact of this emotive language on readers is significant. It can create a sense of unity and shared identity among readers, as well as a feeling of pride and accomplishment. The language can also inspire the reader to believe in the possibility of positive change and to feel optimistic about the future. Overall, the emotive language used in these headlines is intended to evoke strong emotions in the reader and to create a sense of excitement and anticipation for what is to come.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
