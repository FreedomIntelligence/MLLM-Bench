Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the top three countries by GDP among all countries in the chart.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the chart, the top three countries by GDP are the United States, China, and Japan.

United States - $22.675 trillion\n2. China - $17.727 trillion\n3.
