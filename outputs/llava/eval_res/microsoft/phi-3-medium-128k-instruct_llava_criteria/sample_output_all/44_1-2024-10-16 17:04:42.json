    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the red berry in the smoothie bowl in the image? How is it different from the dark purple berry in the bowl? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe red berry in the smoothie bowl is the strawberry, whereas the dark purple berry is the acai berry. Both of these berries are included in the smoothie alongside other fruits, such as blueberries, blackberries, and bananas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n In the image of the smoothie bowl, the red berry appears to be a strawberry. The dark purple berry, on the other hand, seems to be a blueberry.\n\nStrawberries and blueberries differ in several ways:\n\n1. Color: Strawberries are bright red when ripe, while blueberries are dark purple or almost black.\n2. Shape: Strawberries have a heart-like shape with a green leafy top, whereas blueberries are small, round, and have a smooth, uniform surface.\n3. Size: Strawberries are generally larger than blueberries, with an average diameter of about 3 centimeters, while blueberries are smaller, typically around 1 centimeter in diameter.\n4. Taste: Strawberries have a sweet and slightly tart flavor, while blueberries have a milder, sweeter taste.\n5. Nutritional content: Both berries are nutritious and low in calories, but they have different nutritional profiles. Strawberries are higher in vitamin C, while blueberries are richer in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins.\n\nIn summary, the red berry in the smoothie bowl is a strawberry, and it differs from the dark purple berry (blueberry) in color, shape, size, taste, and nutritional content.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the raspberry and describe its color, shape, and texture\n2. Identify the dark purple berry as blackberry.\n3. Include at least one distinctive feature that differentiates the raspberry from the dark purple berry.",
