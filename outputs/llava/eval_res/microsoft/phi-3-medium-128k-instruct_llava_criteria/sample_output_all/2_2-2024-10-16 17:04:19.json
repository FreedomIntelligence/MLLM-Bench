    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine their potential function.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Without an actual image, I'll provide a general approach to identify objects and determine their potential functions.\n\n1. First, carefully examine the image. Pay attention to the shapes, colors, patterns, and textures of the objects.\n2. Group similar objects based on their characteristics. For example, if you see a set of similar-looking items, they might belong to the same category.\n\n3. Identify the objects by their shapes and features. For instance, if you see a round, flat object with a handle, it could be a plate.\n\n4. Look for context clues in the image. Objects in a kitchen might include a refrigerator, stove, or pots and pans. In an office setting, you might see a computer, desk, or chair.\n\n5. Consider the arrangement of the objects. Objects placed together might be related or used together.\n\n6. Use your knowledge of everyday objects to make educated guesses about their functions. For instance, a round object with a handle and a flat surface could be a teacup, and if it's in a kitchen, it's likely used for drinking.\n\n7. If there are any labels, logos, or other identifiable markings, use them to help identify the objects.\n\nHere are a few examples of objects and their potential functions:\n\n- A round, flat object with a handle and a handle: This could be a teacup, used for drinking hot beverages.\n- A rectangular object with a screen and a keyboard: This could be a computer, used for work, communication, or entertainment.\n- A flat, rectangular object with a handle and wheels: This could be a rolling pin, used for rolling dough in cooking.\n- A tall, cylindrical object with a handle: This could be a broom, used for sweeping floors.\n\nRemember that without the actual image, these are just hypothetical examples. The specific objects and their functions would depend on the image's content.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there is a group of seven pens placed inside a clear cup. These pens come in various colors, making them a visually pleasing assortment. The collection of pens in the cup might be a part of a creative workspace, meant for individuals who need to write, draw, or take notes frequently. Such colorful pens can also be used for decorative purposes, adding a touch of color and fun to the environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify objects as screwdrivers.\n2. Describe the potential function of screwdrivers (tightening/loosening screws).\n3. Mention the presence of multiple screwdrivers, noting variety if visible.",
