    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the dancer's landing technique, and suggest the next movements that would follow.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The dancer has just completed a graceful pirouette, spinning on one leg with the other leg extended in a pointed toe position. As the dancer lands, they will focus on maintaining their balance and control. The landing technique will involve a smooth transition from the spinning motion to a stable, grounded stance.\n\nThe dancer will land with their supporting leg slightly bent to absorb the impact, while the other leg remains extended and turned out. The arms will be gracefully lowered to the sides or brought into a preparatory position for the next movement.\n\nFollowing the landing, the dancer could transition into several possible movements, depending on the choreography. Some options could include:\n\n1. A series of battement tendus or battement dégagés, which involve extending and flexing the legs to the front, side, or back, to continue building momentum and maintaining the fluidity of the dance.\n\n2. A grand jeté, a large, elegant leap that will take the dancer through the air, showcasing their strength, agility, and grace.\n\n3. A développé, where the dancer will gradually unfurl their extended leg from a closed position to a fully extended position, demonstrating their flexibility and control.\n\n4. A series of adagio movements, such as rond de jambe or promenade, which will allow the dancer to showcase their balance, control, and expressive qualities.\n\n5. A combination of turns and jumps, such as a fouetté or tour jeté, which will demonstrate the dancer's technical prowess and artistry.\n\nUltimately, the next movements will depend on the choreography and the overall artistic vision of the dance piece. Regardless of the specific steps, the dancer will continue to focus on maintaining their balance, control, and grace throughout the performance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the woman in the blue dress appears to be in the middle of a ballet move, with her arms and legs extended. As she appears to be dancing on the pavement in front of a building, she might be performing an outdoor dance or show. Since she seems to be in mid-air, it is likely that she will be performing a controlled landing, which involves bending her knees slightly to absorb the impact of her feet touching the pavement. Once she lands, she might continue her dance, possibly following a specific choreography or improvising her movements. The next movements could include graceful footwork, turns, or even more aerial maneuvers, depending on the style and complexity of the dance being performed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately predict the dancer's landing technique based on body posture and movement direction.\n2. Suggest plausible next dance movements that could logically follow from the landing position.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects a coherent understanding of dance motion and sequence.",
