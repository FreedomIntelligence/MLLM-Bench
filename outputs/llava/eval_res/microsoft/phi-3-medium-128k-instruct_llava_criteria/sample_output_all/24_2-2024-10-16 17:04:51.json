Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the swimming stroke being used by examining the position of the swimmer's hands and head.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n By examining the position of the swimmer's hands and head, we can determine the swimming stroke being used. Here are some key characteristics of the four most common swimming strokes:\n\n1. Freestyle (Front Crawl):\n   - The swimmer's head is down in the water, with their face submerged.\n   - The arms alternate in a windmill motion, with one arm pulling underwater while the other arm recovers above the water.\n   - The head rotates from side to side as the arms alternate.\n   - The legs perform a flutter kick, with the feet moving up and down in a quick, alternating motion.\n\n2. Breaststroke:\n   - The swimmer's head is above the water, with the face looking forward.\n   - Both arms move simultaneously in a circular motion, with the hands pushing out and then pulling back towards the chest.\n   - The legs perform a frog kick, with the knees bending and feet moving outward and then coming together.\n\n3. Butterfly:\n   - The swimmer's head is down in the water, with their face submerged.\n   - The arms move simultaneously in a windmill motion, with the hands pushing out and then pulling back together above the water.\n   - The legs perform a dolphin kick, with the feet moving upward and then downward in a whipping motion.\n\n4. Backstroke:\n   - The swimmer's head is above the water, with the face looking upward.\n   - The arms move alternately, with one arm pulling underwater while the other arm recovers above the water.\n   - The legs perform an alternating flutter kick, similar to the freestyle.\n\nIf the swimmer's hands are alternating in a windmill motion and the head is submerged, they are likely using the freestyle or butterfly stroke. If the swimmer's head is above the water, they are likely using the breaststroke or backstroke. If the arms move simultaneously in a circular motion, they are likely using the breaststroke. If the arms move simultaneously in a windmill motion and the head is submerged, they are likely using the butterfly stroke.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the swimmer is in the process of taking a stroke while swimming in the water. He is wearing glasses and a white cap. His left arm is extended, and his head is positioned to the side, which suggests that he is using a breaststroke technique to swim. The breaststroke is a swimming stroke where swimmers use their arms and chest muscles to propel themselves through the water in a pattern resembling a breaststroke motion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the swimmer's hands move simultaneously with wingspan-like motion (butterfly stroke).\n2. Confirm the swimmer's head position aligns with butterfly stroke technique (facing down).\n3. Evaluate the synchronicity of hand and head movement indicative of butterfly stroke.",
