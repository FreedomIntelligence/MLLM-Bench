    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the woman's emotional state by examining her gaze and the placement of her hand, considering the potential symbolism of the blurred lights in the background.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The woman's emotional state appears to be one of contemplation or introspection. Her gaze, directed downward, suggests that she is lost in thought or possibly feeling a sense of sadness or melancholy. The placement of her hand on her chin further emphasizes her deep concentration.\n\nThe blurred lights in the background could symbolize a number of things, depending on the context of the photograph. They could represent the chaos or confusion of the world around her, or they could symbolize the uncertainty of the future. Alternatively, the blurred lights could be seen as a contrast to the woman's focused gaze, highlighting her ability to find clarity and meaning in the midst of chaos.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of introspection and contemplation, with the woman's gaze and hand placement conveying a sense of thoughtfulness and reflection. The blurred lights in the background add an element of depth and complexity to the image, inviting viewers to consider the potential symbolism and meaning behind the photograph.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the woman is wearing a black veil and looking to her left side with tearful eyes. The hand that she is holding out appears to be in front of her face, which might indicate that she is blocking her face from the viewer or trying to conceal her emotions. This, in combination with the background where the lights are blurred, creates a somewhat mysterious and potentially symbolic atmosphere. It might suggest the woman is going through an emotional experience or dealing with a challenging situation, and the blurred lights could represent the confusion or the complexity of her emotions at that moment. The woman's gaze and her hand's position also suggest vulnerability, and the blurred lights in the background contribute to a sense of introspection and reflection on her emotions and experiences.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's emotional state  as sadness, regret, or perhaps a sense of longing.",
