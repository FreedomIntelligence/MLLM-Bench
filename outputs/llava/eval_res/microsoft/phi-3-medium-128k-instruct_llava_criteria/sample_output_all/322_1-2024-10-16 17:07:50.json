    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich picture is of lower quality?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe picture on the left is of lower quality compared to the picture on the right.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI, I'm unable to view or compare pictures directly. However, you can compare the quality of two pictures by examining factors such as resolution, sharpness, noise, color accuracy, and overall clarity. If you provide descriptions of the pictures or upload the images to a platform that supports image analysis, I can help guide you on how to determine which one might be of lower quality based on these factors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the picture on the left as of lower quality.\n2. Assess clarity, sharpness, and presence of pixelation or blurriness.\n3. Confirm the left image has more visual artifacts than the right.",
