    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nTaking into consideration the material of the shoes, which pair of shoes in the picture is best suited for long-distance running?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several pairs of shoes stored on shelves in a room. A suitable pair of shoes for long-distance running would be a pair of running shoes, which can be identified by their lightweight, breathable, and cushioned design. The image does not provide enough information to determine the material of the shoes. However, it is likely that the shoes are made from materials like synthetic and mesh for the upper part and a cushioned, supportive, and durable sole with good traction for long-distance running. To find the best pair, it would be necessary to search specifically for running shoes among the stored shoes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To determine the best pair of shoes for long-distance running from a picture, we would need to consider several factors related to the material of the shoes. The ideal materials for long-distance running shoes are those that provide comfort, breathability, durability, and support. Here are some key features to look for:\n\n1. Upper Material: The upper part of the shoe should be made of breathable and flexible materials, such as mesh or knit fabric. These materials allow for good airflow and help to keep the feet cool and dry during long runs.\n\n2. Midsole Material: The midsole is the cushioning layer between the upper and the outsole. It is essential for providing shock absorption and support. The ideal midsole material for long-distance running shoes is EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) or foam, as they offer a good balance between cushioning and responsiveness.\n\n3. Outsole Material: The outsole is the bottom part of the shoe that comes into contact with the ground. A durable rubber compound is ideal for long-distance running shoes, as it offers good traction and durability. A continuous herringbone or wave pattern on the outsole is also beneficial for traction and stability.\n\n4. Sockliner Material: The sockliner is the inner layer of the shoe that comes into contact with the foot. A soft and breathable material, such as synthetic fabric or microfiber, is best for long-distance running shoes.\n\n5. Additional Features: Long-distance running shoes should also have features such as a secure and comfortable fit, a wide toe box for natural foot movement, and good arch support.\n\nWithout the actual picture, it is impossible to determine which pair of shoes is best suited for long-distance running. However, by looking for the features mentioned above, you can identify the most suitable pair of shoes for your long-distance running needs.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify shoes that appear designed for running based on material and structure.\n2. Assess suitability for long-distance running, considering material durability and comfort.\n3. Exclude shoes clearly unsuitable for running (e.g., high heels, boots).",
