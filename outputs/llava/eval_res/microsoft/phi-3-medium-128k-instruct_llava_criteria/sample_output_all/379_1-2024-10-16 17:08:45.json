Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nUse latex grammar to convert the equations in the image into latex formulas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nHere are the latex equations that correspond to the image:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n2. $\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^{2}}{(1-\\sqrt{2})^{2}}$\n3. $\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}$\n4. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3x+2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2x+1}}$\n5. $\\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 4}{2x^2 + 8x - 8}$\n6. $\\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 4}{2x^2 + 8x - 8} + \\frac{2x + 1}{x + 1}$\n7. $\\frac{3x^3 - 10x^2 + 9x - 24}{x^4 - 6x^3 + 18x^2 - 24x}$\n8. $\\frac{3x^3 - 10x^2 + 9x - 24}{x^4 - 6x^3 + 18x^2 - 24x} + \\frac{2x + 5}{x + 1}$\n\nThese latex equations represent a mix of algebraic and scientific notation, along with some trigonometry.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI, I'm unable to view images.

Accurate conversion of handwritten quadratic equation to LaTeX, including powers and coefficients.\n2. Correct use of LaTeX syntax for fractions, square roots, and plus-minus sign.\n3. Preservation of the equation's structure and sequence as shown in the image.",
