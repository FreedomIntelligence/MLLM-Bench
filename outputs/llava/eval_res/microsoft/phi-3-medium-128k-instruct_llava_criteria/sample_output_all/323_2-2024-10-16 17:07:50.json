    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happened to each row of the image from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Without an image provided, I can't provide a specific analysis of what happened to each row from left to right. However, I can explain a general approach to analyzing changes in a series of rows in an image.\n\n1. **Identify the Changes**: Look at the rows from left to right and identify any changes that occur. These could be changes in color, shape, size, position, or any other visual element.\n\n2. **Categorize the Changes**: Once you've identified the changes, categorize them. For example, you might note that the color of a particular object changes from red to blue, or that the size of a shape increases from row to row.\n\n3. **Describe the Pattern**: If there is a pattern to the changes, describe it. For example, you might note that the color of an object changes in a repeating pattern, or that the size of a shape increases by a consistent amount with each row.\n\n4. **Interpret the Changes**: Finally, interpret the changes in the context of the image. This might involve making inferences about what the changes mean or speculating about why they might have occurred.\n\nRemember, this is a general approach and the specific steps you take might vary depending on the image and the changes you observe.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nFrom left to right, each row has one row with a man and the rest of the rows have women.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the progression of image quality from left to right in each row.\n2. Confirm the presence of human faces in varying resolutions and clarity in the image.\n3. Assess if the description includes changes in detail and recognizability.",
