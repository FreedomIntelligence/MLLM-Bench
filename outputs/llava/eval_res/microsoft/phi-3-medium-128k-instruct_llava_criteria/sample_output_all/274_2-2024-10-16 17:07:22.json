    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat could be the relationship between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The relationship between the person holding the pen and the one talking to him could vary depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Colleagues: They could be coworkers or classmates discussing a project or an assignment.\n2. Friends: They might be friends catching up on personal matters or planning an outing.\n3. Teacher and student: The person holding the pen could be a student, and the one talking to him could be a teacher or a mentor providing guidance or feedback.\n4. Business partners: They might be discussing a business plan or strategy.\n5. Parent and child: The person holding the pen might be a child, and the one talking to him could be a parent or guardian.\n6. Author and editor: The person holding the pen could be an author, and the one talking could be an editor providing feedback on a manuscript.\n7. Artist and client: The person holding the pen could be an artist sketching a design, and the one talking to him could be a client discussing the details of the project.\n8. Doctor and patient: The person holding the pen could be a doctor, and the one talking to him could be a patient discussing medical concerns.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and the relationship could be anything depending on the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the person holding the pen is likely the interviewer, while the person speaking to him is the interviewee. The interviewee is sitting in front of the interviewer, and the interviewer has a book open, which suggests that he might be taking notes or referring to some information during the conversation. The interaction between them takes place on a table, reinforcing the perception that this is a professional setting and an interview context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify potential professional relationship based on attire, setting, and body language.\n2. Assess dialogue cues suggesting hierarchy, cooperation, or advisory roles.",
