    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssuming the rider continues to travel in the same direction, will he appear on the right side of the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, if the rider continues to travel in the same direction, he will eventually appear on the right side of the picture as he continues along his path. Since the motorcycle is moving, it is expected that the rider will be further away from the initial starting point and eventually be on the right side of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Assuming the rider is moving forward in the direction shown in the picture, he will not appear on the right side of the picture. Instead, he will continue to be in the same position relative to the camera, which is capturing the scene from the left side. If the rider changes direction and moves to the right, then he would appear on the right side of the picture. However, without additional context or information about the rider's movement, we cannot definitively say that he will appear on the right side of the picture.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify that the rider is riding towards the left side.\n2. Infer that the rider is unlikely to appear on the right side.",
