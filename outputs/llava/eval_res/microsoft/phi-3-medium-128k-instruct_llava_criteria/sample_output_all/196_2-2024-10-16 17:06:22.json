    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the endoscopy image of the stomach, describe the image in detail and identify anomalies visible in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the provided endoscopy image of the stomach, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The stomach lining appears to be intact, with a smooth and regular mucosal pattern visible.\n2. The pyloric sphincter, which is the muscular valve that regulates the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine, appears to be functioning normally.\n3. No visible ulcers, erosions, or abnormal growths are seen on the mucosal surface of the stomach.\n4. The color of the stomach lining is a healthy pinkish-red, which is a sign of good blood supply and absence of inflammation.\n5. The gastric folds, which are the ridges on the stomach lining, are evenly distributed and maintain a normal appearance.\n\nIn summary, the endoscopy image of the stomach appears to be normal, with no visible anomalies or signs of pathology. However, it is essential to note that the interpretation of endoscopy images should be performed by a trained medical professional, and this description is for informational purposes only.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts an endoscopy of a stomach, revealing the pink and red interior of the gastrointestinal tract. The lining of the stomach appears swollen, with a large hole or hollow area in the middle. The hole, filled with small pink and red granules, suggests the presence of gastritis. The granules are also scattered throughout the stomach, both inside and outside the hollow space, further indicating inflammation. This scene suggests an ongoing condition like the stomach disease erosive gastritis, which can lead to complications if not properly managed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any visible anomalies in the stomach lining, such as abnormal growths or coloration.\n2. Describe the overall condition of the stomach mucosa, including texture and vascular pattern.\n3. Mention the presence of any normal anatomical structures, such as gastric folds.",
