    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I intend to pack a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand, which container from the picture should I select?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image and considering the size of a grown man's hand, I would recommend using the largest cup available. It is located towards the right side of the image and seems to be a good fit for the sandwich. However, it is important to keep in mind that cups are typically designed for beverages and not for housing food items like a sandwich. Therefore, you might need to use a more suitable container or wrap the sandwich securely before placing it in the cup.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To pack a sandwich that matches the dimensions of a grown man's hand, you would need to choose a container that is large enough to accommodate the size of the sandwich. \n\nA grown man's hand typically measures around 8-9 inches (20-23 cm) in length and 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) in width. Therefore, you should select a container that is at least 9 inches long and 4 inches wide.\n\nLooking at the picture provided, you should choose the container that is closest to these dimensions while still being able to hold the sandwich without squishing it. If there is no container that matches these dimensions exactly, choose the one that is the largest size available.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify container size suitable for a grown man's hand-sized sandwich.\n2. Justify container choice based on dimensions and shape.",
