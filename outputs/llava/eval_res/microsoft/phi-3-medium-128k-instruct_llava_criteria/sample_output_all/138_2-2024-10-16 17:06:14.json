    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the postures and tools involved in this activity to determine the profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the description of the activity, it appears that the person is engaged in a task that requires precision, focus, and the use of specialized tools. The postures and tools suggest that the profession could be a surgeon, a dentist, or a watchmaker.\n\nIf the person is standing or sitting upright, with a steady hand and using small, precise instruments, it could be a surgeon performing a surgical procedure. Surgeons typically perform intricate operations using scalpels, forceps, and other specialized tools in a sterile environment.\n\nIf the person is bending over a patient or a workbench, with a magnifying glass or a microscope, it could be a dentist working on a patient's teeth or gums. Dentists use dental drills, mirrors, and other dental instruments to perform procedures such as fillings, root canals, or extractions.\n\nIf the person is working at a small table with a magnifying glass or a loupe, and using tiny tools to manipulate small components, it could be a watchmaker or a jeweler repairing or assembling delicate timepieces or jewelry.\n\nTo further narrow down the profession, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Environment: Is the person in a hospital, dental clinic, or a watchmaker's workshop?\n\n2. Tools: Are they using surgical instruments, dental tools, or watchmaker's tools?\n\n3. Attire: Is the person wearing medical scrubs, a white coat, or a lab coat?\n\n4. Equipment: Are there medical equipment, dental chairs, or watchmaking tools and benches in the vicinity?\n\n5. Patients or clients: Are they working with a patient or a customer?\n\n6. Surroundings: Is there a sterile environment, dental equipment, or watchmaking tools and benches around them?\n\nBy considering these factors, you can determine the specific profession of the person more accurately.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of men engaged in a construction activity, likely related to a building. One man is using a large axe to break through a block or stone, which appears to be a key step in the construction process. The presence of several other men suggests that they are working together as a team. The tools used in the image, such as the large axe, indicate that these individuals are likely professional laborers or skilled workers involved in a construction project. It can be inferred that their primary responsibilities might include breaking stones, demolishing structures, or preparing the groundwork for the construction of new buildings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tool silhouette (not a sewing machine) and relate to a profession.\n2. Analyze silhouetted postures for actions typical of specific jobs.",
