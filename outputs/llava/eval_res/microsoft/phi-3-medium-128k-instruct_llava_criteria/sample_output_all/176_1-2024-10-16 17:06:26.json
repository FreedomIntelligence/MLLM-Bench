    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCan you determine the approximate diameter of the plate, assuming the diameter of an average orange is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm)?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nSince the plate is described as being in the center of the box and is described as a \"small\" plate, it is likely that the diameter of the plate is smaller than the average size of an orange. However, without more information or a clear view of the plate, it is not possible to determine the exact diameter of the plate.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Sure, if we assume the diameter of an average orange is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm), the plate's diameter would need to be at least large enough to accommodate two oranges placed side by side. \n\nTo determine the approximate diameter of the plate, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Determine the combined diameter of two oranges placed side by side.\nSince the diameter of an average orange is 3 inches, the combined diameter of two oranges would be:\n\n3 inches (orange 1) + 3 inches (orange 2) = 6 inches\n\n2. Add some extra space for the gaps between the oranges and the edges of the plate.\nTo ensure that the oranges fit comfortably on the plate, we can add some extra space around them. Let's add 1 inch on each side:\n\n6 inches (combined diameter of oranges) + 1 inch (gap on one side) + 1 inch (gap on the other side) = 8 inches\n\nTherefore, the approximate diameter of the plate would be 8 inches to accommodate two oranges placed side by side with some extra space on each side.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes plate diameter estimation using orange as reference.\n2. Estimation aligns with provided reference: approximately 6 inches.",
