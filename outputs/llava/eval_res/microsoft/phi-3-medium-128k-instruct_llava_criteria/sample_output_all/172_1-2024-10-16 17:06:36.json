    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 700*1050, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,1050) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (700,0). Please give the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe spoon tail is located at the top of the image, slightly to the right and above the center. Its approximate coordinates would be (150, 0.14, 230, 0.49).\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the description, it seems like the spoon tail is at the bottom of the image, close to the bottom right corner. Since the image is 700 pixels wide and 1050 pixels. pixels tall, and the spoon tail is located near the bottom right corner, we can estimate the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail.\n\nAssuming the spoon tail is about 1/40.2 (20%) of the height from the bottom of the image and about 1/0. Assuming the spoon tail is about 1/0.2 (20%) of the width from the right side of the image, we can estimate the coordinates of the spoon tail.\n\nHeight from the bottom left bottom corner: 1050 * 0.2 = 210 pixels tall\nWidth from the bottom left corner: 700 * 0.2 = 10.4 * 700 = 140 wide\n\nSo, the approximate coordinates of the spoon tail would be (140, 210) in the coordinate system, where the bottom left corner is the origin (0,0). Note that this is a rough estimation, and the right coordinates might vary slightly based on the actual shape and position of the spoon tail in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must include coordinates close to the reference: (200,315), the closer the better",
