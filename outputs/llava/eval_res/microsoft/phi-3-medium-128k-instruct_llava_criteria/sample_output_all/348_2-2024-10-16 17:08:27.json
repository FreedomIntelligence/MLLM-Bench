    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze if the people in the image hold a ethical demand.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n As an AI, I'm unable to view images directly. However, I can help you analyze the situation based on the description you provide. In order to analyze whether the people in the image hold an ethical demand, please describe the image and the context in which the people are depicted. Details about their actions, expressions, and the overall setting can help determine if there is an ethical demand.\n\nEthical demands typically involve situations where individuals or groups are advocating for what they consider to be morally right or just. For example, if the image shows people protesting for human rights, environmental protection, or fair labor practices, these could be considered ethical demands. Please provide more information about the image, and I can offer a more detailed analysis.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, the people in the image are holding up signs with political demands, which suggests that they are advocating for a particular cause or ethical position. Given the variety of signs they are holding, it indicates that they are representing diverse opinions or concerns, which is typically found in protests or demonstrations. By participating in such events, the individuals are voicing their opinions and raising awareness about the issues they consider important, with the intention of influencing societal change, policy-making, or public opinion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the image depicts a demand for ethical treatment or social justice.\n2. Evaluate the presence of signs or expressions that convey an ethical stance.\n3. Determine the context of the demand, such as anti-racism or human rights.",
