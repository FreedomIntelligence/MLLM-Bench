    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the next move of the animal in this wintry habitat and describe the objective of this action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n In this wintry habitat, let's consider a snowshoe hare. The next move of the snowshoe hare might be to hop along the snow-covered ground in search of food. The objective of this action is to find vegetation, such as twigs, buds, and bark, which are essential for its survival during the harsh winter months. By hopping, the hare can move quickly and efficiently through the snow, while its large hind feet act like snowshoes, preventing it from sinking into the snow.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a fox is captured mid-air, jumping high into the air over a snowy field with tall grass. This motion suggests that the fox is either hunting or attempting to catch prey. The objective of this action is to ensure the survival of the fox in a competitive environment by obtaining food. Foxes are opportunistic predators and rely on their agility, keen senses, and stealth to catch their prey, typically small mammals or birds. By performing this jump, the fox is showcasing its ability to adapt and hunt in adverse weather conditions and challenging environments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the fox's next likely action related to hunting in the snow.\n2. Describe the purpose of the predicted action in relation to hunting.\n3. Ensure the response is consistent with the wintry habitat context.",
