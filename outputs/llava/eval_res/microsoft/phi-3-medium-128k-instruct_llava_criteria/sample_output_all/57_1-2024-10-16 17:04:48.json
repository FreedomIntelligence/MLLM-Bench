    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the significance of the temple shown in the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe significance of the temple in the image can be inferred from its impressive and intricate design elements, such as the red and gold color scheme, the presence of statues, dragons, and lanterns, and the large staircases leading up to its entrance. These features suggest that the temple is an important place of worship and reflection for the local community, possibly serving as a landmark or tourist attraction. The fact that many people are present in the image, walking up and down the stairs, showcases the temple's cultural value and attraction, further emphasizing its importance in the community.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Without an image to refer to, I can't provide specific details. However, if you provide more information about the temple, such as its location, architectural style, or any unique features, I would be happy to help you understand its significance.\n\nTemples can hold significant cultural, religious, and historical importance. They often serve as places of worship, community gathering, and sometimes as landmarks of architectural achievement. They can also be symbolic of the civilization that built them. For example, the Parthenon in Athens is a symbol of Ancient Greek civilization, while the Temple of Karnak in Egypt is a testament to the religious practices of the Ancient Egyptians.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the temple as \"Fushimi Inari-taisha.\"\n2. List visual clues showing the temple is Fushimi Inari-taisha.\n 3.Describe the significance of the temple.",
