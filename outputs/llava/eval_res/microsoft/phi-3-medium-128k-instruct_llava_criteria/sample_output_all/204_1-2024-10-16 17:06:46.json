Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is placed above the onion directly?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nA hamburger patty is placed directly above the onion.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Above the onion in a typical kitchen pantry, you might find various items depending on the organization of the pantry. However, if we're talking about the anatomical structure of an onion, directly above the onion would be the fleshy layers of the bulb. If we're referring to a culinary context, it could be another vegetable or ingredient placed in storage. If you're looking at an onion on a cutting board, the layers of the onion itself or a knife used for cutting it might be directly above it.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the object directly above the onion as tomato.\n2. Answer correctly describes the spatial relationship.",
