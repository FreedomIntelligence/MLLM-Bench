    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the relationship between two birds in the image, what kind of natural relation do they show?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are two birds, one small and one large. They are perched together on a tree branch with the small bird having its mouth open and the larger bird leaning over to feed it. This scene demonstrates a nurturing relationship between the two birds, where the larger one is providing food and care for the smaller bird. This is a natural behavior observed in many bird species, particularly when parent birds feed their offspring or when one bird helps another in times of need. The fact that the larger bird is feeding the smaller bird signifies a bonding experience and cooperation between the two species.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Without an image to refer to, I can provide a general analysis of the possible relationships between two birds in a given image.\n\nBirds can exhibit various types of relationships in nature, which can be classified into different categories. Here are some common natural relationships between birds:\n\n1. **Mutualism:** This is a type of symbiotic relationship where both birds benefit from their interaction. For example, one bird might help another to find food, and in return, the other bird may help in cleaning parasites off the first bird's body. An example of this is when one species of bird picks insects off the feathers of another bird, providing a cleaning service while feeding on the parasites.\n\n2. **Competition:** Birds may compete for resources such as food, nesting sites, or mates. This can lead to aggressive interactions or displays of dominance.\n\n3. **Predation:** One bird may be preying on the other, such as a hawk hunting smaller birds.\n\n4. **Commensalism:** One bird may benefit from the presence of another without either harming or helping the other. For example, a bird might use the leftovers of a predator's meal.\n\n5. **Parasitism:** One bird may be a parasite, such as a cuckoo laying its eggs in the nest of another species, which then raises the cuckoo's offspring at the expense of its own.\n\n6. **Altruism:** One bird might be helping another without any immediate benefit to itself, such as when a bird feeds another bird that is injured or sick.\n\n7. **Cooperation:** Birds might work together to achieve a common goal, such as flocking together to protect each other from predators or to increase foraging efficiency.\n\n8. **Social Structure:** Birds may have complex social structures, such as those seen in flocks or colonies, where they engage in cooperative breeding, sharing of resources, or coordinated hunting.\n\nTo provide a more accurate analysis, an image or a detailed description would be necessary.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify brood parasitism as the natural relationship depicted.",
