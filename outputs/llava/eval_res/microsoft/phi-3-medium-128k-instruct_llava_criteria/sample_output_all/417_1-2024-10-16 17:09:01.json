    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease identify and name each visible component of the watch mechanism, such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nInside the watch mechanism, we can see various components such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates. The gears are metal parts with teeth that help transfer power from one component to another. The jewels are usually made of a precious metal and are used to reduce friction between gears, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. The spring is a vital component that provides the power required to keep the watch running. Lastly, the plates are the main structural components of the watch movement, which help hold all the components together and guide their movements. These components work together to make the watch tick and keep accurate time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n 1. Crown: The knob used to set the time and date on the watch.\n2. Crown Tube: The cylindrical tube that houses the crown.\n3. Winding Pinion: A small gear attached to the crown that winds the mainspring.\n4. Main Spring: The coiled spring that stores energy to power the watch.\n5. Barrel: A gear that is attached to the mainspring and releases energy to the watch's movement.\n6. Escapement: A mechanism that regulates the release of energy from the barrel to the balance wheel.\n7. Balance Wheel: A wheel that oscillates back and forth, regulating the speed of the watch.\n8. Balance Spring: A spring that is attached to the balance wheel and helps regulate its oscillations.\n9. Pallet Fork: A gear that transfers energy from the barrel to the escape wheel.\n10. Escape Wheel: A gear that is regulated by the escape mechanism and controls the release of energy from the barrel.\n11. Anchor Escapement: The most common type of escapement mechanism, which uses an anchor-shaped piece to regulate the movement of the escape wheel.\n12. Jewels: Synthetic diamonds or other materials used to reduce friction and wear on the watch's moving parts.\n13. Bridge: A metal plate that supports the movement and connects the various components.\n14. Hands: The pointers that indicate the time on the watch face.\n15. Watch Face: The circular dial that displays the time and other information.\n16. Watch Case: The outer casing that protects the watch's movement and other components.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all visible components like gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n2. Accurately name each component based on watchmaking terminology.\n3. Ensure descriptions are clear and correspond to the specific parts in the image.",
