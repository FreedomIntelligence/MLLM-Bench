    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues, estimate the approximate height of the woman.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman is likely approximately 5.5 feet tall or shorter, as she is described as a \"little woman\" and is standing below both the large man and the large person in a jacket. Her height is in contrast to the taller individuals present in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n It's difficult to estimate the exact height of the woman without a reference point or a scale. However, based on visual cues such as her height relative to objects or people around her, we can make an educated guess. If she appears to be around the same height as a standard door (about 6 feet 8 inches or 203 cm), or if she's about the same height as an average adult male (around 5 feet 9 inches or 175 cm), she might be around that height. Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and can vary depending on the camera angle and perspective.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes estimated height of woman using visual comparison with reference heights.\n2. Estimation acknowledges the reference heights of Yao Ming and Shaquille O'Neal.",
