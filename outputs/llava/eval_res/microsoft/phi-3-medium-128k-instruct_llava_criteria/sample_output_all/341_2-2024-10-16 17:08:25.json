    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess if the image reveals a discrimination phenomenon.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To assess if an image reveals a discrimination phenomenon, we need to analyze the context, content, and presentation within the image. Discrimination can manifest in various forms, such as racial, gender, age, or other biases. However, without an actual image provided, I can't evaluate a specific case. Generally, an image may reveal discrimination through visual cues like segregation, stereotypical representations, or exclusionary practices depicted within it. If an image shows a group being treated unfairly based on their inherent or perceived characteristics, it could be indicative of discrimination.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, two women are wearing blue headscarves, while a man is wearing a blue shirt. It is essential to note that they are all standing next to each other. There is no indication of discrimination based on the color of their clothing. However, the image does include a man pointing at the women, which could be interpreted as a sign of prejudice or judgment. Nonetheless, further context would be needed to determine if the pointing is justifiable or constitutes discriminatory behavior.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify signs of religious discrimination in the image.\n2. Evaluate the context of any interaction between individuals.\n3. Assess emotional expressions and body language for discrimination evidence.",
