    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAccording to the radar chart, what does Libertarianism feature?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n A radar chart, also known as a spider chart or a star chart, is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. Libertarianism, as a political ideology, would be represented on a radar chart by plotting various core values or principles that are typically associated with it. These principles might include individual freedom, limited government, free-market capitalism, non-interventionism, and civil liberties. The values for each principle would be plotted on the radar chart, and the points would be connected to form a shape that represents the Libertarian stance on these issues. The resulting shape would highlight the emphasis Libertarianism places on these principles, with values closer to the center indicating less emphasis and values farther from the center indicating more emphasis.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe radar chart shows that Libertarianism features a strong emphasis on individualism, freedom, and minimal government intervention. It is located near the center of the chart, surrounded by various other ideologies, such as Postmodernism, Marxism, and Feminism. The radar chart indicates that while there is some overlap between these ideologies, Libertarianism stands out due to its primary focus on individual freedom and limited government involvement. This emphasis distinguishes it from other ideologies, which may prioritize collective rights, social equality, or broader governmental intervention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Libertarianism's highest score as Liberty.\n2. Identify Libertarianism's lowest score as either Equality or Progress, since these two aspects have approximately the same scores that cannot be differentiated.\n",
