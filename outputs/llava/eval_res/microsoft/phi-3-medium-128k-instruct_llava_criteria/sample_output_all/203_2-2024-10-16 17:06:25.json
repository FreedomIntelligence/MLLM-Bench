Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIn relation to the digital temperature readout at the top of the beverage cooler, which type of beverage is directly below it?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To answer this question, we would need a visual representation or a description of the arrangement of beverages in the cooler. Assuming that the cooler is organized in a grid pattern with the temperature readout at the top, we could infer the beverage below it based on the layout. If the beverages are arranged alphabetically or by type (e.g., sodas, juices, waters), the beverage directly below the temperature readout would be the next in sequence. Without additional context, it is not possible to determine which specific beverage is located below the temperature readout.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nA bottle of diet Coke is directly below the digital temperature readout at the top of the beverage cooler.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and confirm the type of beverage as milk drinks directly below the temperature readout.\n2. Assess the VLM's understanding of spatial relationships between the readout and beverages.\n3. Verify the accuracy and relevance of the VLM's response to the given instruction.",
