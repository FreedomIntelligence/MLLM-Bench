    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nFor the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish in the bottom right photograph, can you determine the bounding box coordinates for the spoon? (The size of the image is 4096*4096)\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To determine the bounding box coordinates for the spoon in the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish, I would need to visually inspect the image. However, as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to view or analyze images directly.\n\nIf you can describe the position of the spoon in the image or provide any other details, I could help you calculate the bounding box coordinates based on the information you provide. Alternatively, you could use image processing tools or software to detect and locate the spoon in the image and then determine the bounding box coordinates.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bounding box coordinates for the spoon in the \"Lab Ma Noi\" dish in the bottom right photograph are [0.69, 0.75, 0.85, 0.96] with a slight offset due to the angle.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify and provide bounding box coordinates around [(2048, 60), (3275, 1043)]",
