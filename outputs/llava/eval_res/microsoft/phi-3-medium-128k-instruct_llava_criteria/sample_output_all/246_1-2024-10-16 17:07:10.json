    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the user interfaces displayed on each smartphone's screen, noting differences in icon design, color schemes, and layout.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are two identical smartphones displayed side by side, yet their user interfaces showcase differences in icon design, color schemes, and layout. The icons on the screens have various shapes and colors, which reflect the individual design preferences of the device owners. The layout of the apps on the screens is also different, with some apps arranged in a row or a grid, while others may have a more random arrangement. The color schemes of the user interfaces also vary, providing distinct visual experiences for each device. Overall, while both smartphones showcase a green home screen, the differences in icon design, layout, and color scheme create unique aesthetics for each device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To compare the user interfaces displayed on each smartphone's screen, we'll look at three main aspects: icon design, color schemes, and layout.
