    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Analyzing current automotive design trends can provide insights into the potential future evolution of automotive design. Some of the current trends that could shape the future of automotive design include:\n\n1. Electric vehicles (EVs): With the increasing focus on sustainability and reducing carbon emissions, EVs are becoming more popular. This trend is likely to continue, leading to more advanced EV designs that are sleeker, more aerodynamic, and have integrated charging capabilities.\n\n2. Autonomous driving technology: As autonomous driving technology advances, it is expected that future automotive designs will incorporate features that support autonomous driving, such as advanced sensors, cameras, and communication systems.\n\n3. Connectivity: The integration of technology into vehicles is becoming more prevalent, with features such as touchscreens, smartphone integration, and voice control. Future designs will likely continue to focus on connectivity, with more advanced infotainment systems and seamless integration of smart devices.\n\n4. Lightweight materials: The use of lightweight materials, such as aluminum and carbon fiber, is becoming more common in automotive design. This trend is expected to continue, with future designs incorporating even lighter and more advanced materials to improve fuel efficiency and performance.\n\n5. Aerodynamics: As fuel efficiency becomes a more significant concern, automotive designs are becoming more aerodynamic. Future designs may incorporate even more advanced aerodynamic features, such as active grille shutters, underbody panels, and adaptive spoilers.\n\n6. Customization: The trend of personalized and customized vehicles is growing, with consumers seeking unique and individualized designs. Future automotive designs may offer more customization options, allowing consumers to tailor their vehicles to their preferences.\n\n7. Minimalism: The trend of minimalism in automotive design, characterized by clean lines, simple forms, and uncluttered interiors, is becoming more prevalent. This trend is likely to continue, with future designs focusing on simplicity and functionality.\n\n8. Sustainability: The increasing focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of vehicles will likely lead to more eco-friendly automotive designs. Future designs may incorporate more sustainable materials, such as recycled plastics and bio-based materials, and focus on reducing waste and emissions during production.\n\n9. Shared mobility: The trend of shared mobility, such as car-sharing and ride-hailing services, is growing. Future automotive designs may incorporate features that support shared mobility, such as easy access and egress, and modular interiors that can be easily adapted for different users.\n\n10. Safety: The importance of safety in automotive design is becoming more apparent, with features such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and crash avoidance technology. Future designs will likely continue to focus on safety, with even more advanced safety features and technologies.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
