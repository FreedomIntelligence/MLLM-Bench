    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The comedic effect in a cow's expression and pose is often achieved through the following elements:\n\n1. Exaggerated features: The cow's facial expression may be exaggerated to appear surprised, shocked, or confused. This can include large, wide eyes, a drooping lower jaw, or a protruding tongue. These features make the cow appear as if it is in disbelief or astonishment, which can be humorous.\n\n2. Playful body language: The cow may be depicted. For example, the cow may be shown with its legs spread wide apart, as if it'is standing on tiptoe. This exaggerated pose can make the cow appear clumsy, silly, or awkward.\n\n3. Context: The setting or in which the cow is placed can also contribute to the comedic effect. For instance, the cow may be in a place where it doesn't belong, like a city street or a fancy restaurant. This unexpected context can make the cow's expression and pose seem even more absurd and may be.\n\n4. Contrast: The cow's expression and pose may be contrasting in contrast to the reactions of other characters or objects in the image. For example, the cow may be in a group of other animals that are calm and composed, while the cow is the only one-one that is reacting in a comedic way. This contrast can highlight the cow's unique expression and humorous response to the situation.\n\n5. Anthropomorphism: Giving the cow human-like it's features, such as a smiling face, a surprised expression, or even a thought bubble, or speech bubble, can make the image more relatable and funny. This anthropomorphism helps to humanize the cow and make it easier for the viewer to connect with its emotions and reactions. This can make the cow's expression and pose even more comedic.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
