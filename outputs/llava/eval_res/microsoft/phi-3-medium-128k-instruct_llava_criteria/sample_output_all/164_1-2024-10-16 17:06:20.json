    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven an image of an e-mail, determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe author's primary intention behind sending the email is likely to inform the recipient about three urgent updates, possibly related to politics or a specific event. The email includes a smiling man wearing a blue shirt, suggesting that the recipient might be familiar with the person or the situation described in the email. The presence of a flag in the image and the name \"Mike Johnson\" may provide additional context or information about the updates the recipient should be aware of.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To determine the author's primary intention behind sending the email, I would analyze the content, tone, and context of the message. Here are some steps I would follow:\n\n1. Read the subject line: The subject line often gives a clear indication of the email's purpose. For example, \"Meeting Request,\" \"Invitation to Event,\" or \"Invoice for Services\" all suggest different intentions.\n\n2. Analyze the greeting: The way the sender addresses the recipient can provide clues about the email's intention. A formal greeting, such as \"Dear Mr. Smith,\" might suggest a professional or business-related email, while a casual greeting, like \"Hi there,\" could indicate a more personal email.\n\n3. Examine the content and tone: The body of the email will provide the most information about the sender's intention. Look for specific requests, questions, or statements that reveal the purpose of the email. Also, pay attention to the tone—is it friendly, formal, or urgent? This can help you determine the sender's intention.\n\n4. Look for any attachments or links: If the email includes attachments or links, they may provide additional context about the sender's intention. For example, an attachment could be a document related to a business proposal, while a link could be to an event registration page.\n\n5. Consider the context: Think about the relationship between the sender and the recipient and any previous communication they may have had. This can help you understand the email's intention within the broader context of their relationship.\n\n6. Summarize the primary intention: Based on your analysis of the subject line, greeting, content, tone, and context, summarize the sender's primary intention. For example, \"The sender's primary intention is to request a meeting to discuss a potential business partnership.\"\n\nRemember that each email is unique, and the sender's intention may not always be immediately clear. It's essential to read the email carefully and consider all aspects of the message before drawing conclusions about the sender's intention.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the email's purpose is to inform, request action, or another intention.\n2. Assess how the email's content supports the identified primary intention.\n3. Determine the relevance of updates mentioned to the email's primary intention.",
