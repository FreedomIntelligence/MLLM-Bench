    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n CT Brain Examination Report:\n\nPatient Information:\nName: [Patient Name]\nAge: [Age]\nGender: [Gender]\nDate of Examination: [Date]\nReferring Physician: [Referring Physician Name]\n\nClinical History:\nThe patient presented with complaints of persistent headaches, dizziness, and occasional episodes of nausea. A CT scan of the brain was ordered to evaluate the potential causes of these symptoms.\n\nCT Findings:\n\n1. Brain Parenchyma:\nThere is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration. The gray-white differentiation is preserved. No acute infarcts or abnormal enhancement are seen within the brain parenchyma.\n\n2. Cerebral Hemispheres:\nThe cerebral hemispheres appear symmetrical. There are no focal abnormalities within the cerebral hemispheres.\n\n3. Basal Ganglia and Thalami:\nThe basal ganglia and thalami appear normal in size and density. No calcifications or abnormal signal intensities are noted.\n\n4. Cerebellum and Brainstem:\nThe cerebellum and brainstem structures are unremarkable, with no mass effect or abnormal signal intensity.\n\n5. Ventricular System:\nThe ventricles are of normal size and configuration, with no evidence of hydrocephalus or ventricular enlargement.\n\n6. Cranial Fossa:\nThe anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae are unremarkable.\n\n7. Skull:\nNo evidence of skull fracture or lytic lesions. The sella turcica appears normal.\n\n8. Paranasal Sinuses:\nThe paranasal sinuses are clear without evidence of inflammation, masses, or fluid levels.\n\n9. Extracranial:\nNo abnormalities are seen in the extra-axial spaces.\n\n10. Soft Tissues:\nThe soft tissues of the head and neck are unremarkable.\n\nImpression:\n\nThe CT scan of the brain reveals no acute intracranial pathology. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or focal abnormalities within the brain parenchyma, cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalami, cerebellum, brainstem, ventricular system, cranial fossa, or paranasal sinuses. The skull and soft tissues are unremarkable. The findings are within normal limits.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nGiven the negative CT scan, further evaluation for the patient's symptoms may be warranted. Consideration of additional imaging studies, such as an MRI of the brain, or consultation with a neurologist may be beneficial.\n\nRadiologist:\n[Radiologist Name], MD\n[Specialty: Radiology]\n[Date of Report]\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
