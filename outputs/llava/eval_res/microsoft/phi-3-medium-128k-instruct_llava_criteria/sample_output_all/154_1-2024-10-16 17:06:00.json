    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The event, a formal military parade, was a spectacle of discipline and ceremony, showcasing the rigorous training and precision of the military personnel. The soldiers marched in perfect unison, their boots hitting the ground in a synchronized rhythm. Each movement was executed with military precision, reflecting the strict discipline ingrained in the military culture. The ceremony was marked by a series of elaborate rituals, including the raising of the national flag, the playing of the national anthem, and the execution of a ceremonial salute. The parade was led by a commanding officer, who exuded authority and commanded respect. The soldiers wore their uniforms with pride, each piece of their attire meticulously arranged and polished. The ceremony was punctuated by the sounds of the marching band, adding a musical backdrop to the visual display of discipline.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify elements indicating a formal ceremony (uniforms, marching, flags).\n2. Describe the disciplined behavior (synchronized movements, formations).\n3. Mention the context suggesting a multicultural event.",
