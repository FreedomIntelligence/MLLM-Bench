    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two pictures closely to identify differences between them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To help you examine the two pictures and identify differences between them, I will guide you through a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Position the pictures side by side: Place both pictures next to each other on a flat surface, ensuring that both are oriented in the same direction (e.g., portrait or landscape).\n\n2. Compare the overall composition: Observe the general layout of the two pictures. Are they similar in size, shape, or orientation? Do they have the same subject matter or theme?\n\n3. Focus on the foreground and background: Check for any differences in the foreground and background elements of the pictures. Are there any objects, people, or scenery that appear in one picture but not in the other?\n\n4. Analyze the color palette: Examine the colors used in each picture. Do they have the same color scheme, or are there noticeable differences in the hues, saturation, or brightness?\n\n5. Look for variations in lighting and shadows: Pay attention to the lighting and shadows in the pictures. Are there differences in the direction, intensity, or quality of the light? Do the shadows cast by objects appear differently in the two pictures?\n\n6. Observe the details: Zoom in on the smaller details of the pictures. Are there any differences in textures, patterns, or fine details that stand out?\n\n7. Compare the perspective and depth: Analyze the perspective and depth of each picture. Are the objects in the foreground and background positioned similarly, or are there differences in their apparent distance from the viewer?\n\n8. Note any text, captions, or labels: If there is any text, captions, or labels in the pictures, compare them for any differences in wording, font, or placement.\n\n9. Consider the mood and atmosphere: Observe the overall mood and atmosphere of each picture. Do they evoke different emotions or convey a different feeling?\n\n10. Summarize the differences: After carefully examining the two pictures, list out the differences you have observed, such as differences in composition, color, lighting, details, perspective, or mood.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively compare the two pictures and identify the differences between them.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe two pictures depict a girl in a red Santa hat working on decorating a gingerbread house. In one scene, she is putting the finishing touches on the house by applying a green decoration on the roof. In the other scene, she is placing a ribbon on the house. Both pictures capture the creative process of building and decorating a gingerbread house, showcasing the attention to detail and care put into the project.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in hat, hair, collar, shadow on face, shirt stripes, decoration above toy house floor.",
