    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The meme in question features a popular cartoon character, Bugs Bunny, standing in front of a vending machine, frustrated that it's out of his favorite snack. Above the image, the text reads, \"When you're craving a snack, but the vending machine is out of order.\"\n\nThere are several elements of humor in this meme:\n\n1. Relatable situation: Most people have experienced the frustration of wanting a snack, only to find that the vending machine is out of order. This relatable situation adds to the humor of the meme.\n\n2. Character: Bugs Bunny is a well-known and beloved cartoon character, whose exaggerated expressions and body language can be funny in themselves. In this meme, Bugs Bunny's exasperated expression and body language add to the humor.\n\n3. Exaggeration: The situation is exaggerated for comedic effect. Bugs Bunny is depicted as being so frustrated that he's practically begging the vending machine to work, which is an exaggeration of a common, everyday annoyance.\n\n4. Text: The text above the image adds to the humor by framing the situation as a relatable, everyday annoyance, rather than a dire emergency.\n\nThe type of humor employed in this meme is situational humor. The humor arises from the relatable situation of wanting a snack and being unable to get it because the vending machine is out of order. The use of a popular cartoon character, exaggeration, and relatable text all contribute to the situational humor in this meme.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
