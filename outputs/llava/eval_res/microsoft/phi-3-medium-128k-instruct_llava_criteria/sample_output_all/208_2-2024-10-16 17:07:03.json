    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the person in the image wants to play higher notes, in which direction should the right hand move?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To play higher notes on a string instrument like the violin or guitar, the person should move the right hand up the neck or fingerboard towards the body of the instrument. This is because the pitch of the notes increases as the length of the vibrating string decreases. By moving the fingers closer to the body, the effective length of the string that can vibrate is shortened, resulting in a higher pitch.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIf the person in the image wants to play higher notes on a piano, they should move their right hand upwards along the keyboard. The black piano keys are arranged in a specific pattern, and each key corresponds to a particular note on the music staff. By moving their hand upwards, the person can select and press a key that corresponds to a higher pitch, resulting in the corresponding note being played. The exact movement could be towards the right side of the keyboard, depending on the specific piano. To understand this, one should familiarize themselves with the piano keyboard layout and the relationship between the keys and the notes they represent.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must state the right hand moves to the right to play higher notes.\n2. Response should demonstrate understanding of spatial relationships on a keyboard.",
