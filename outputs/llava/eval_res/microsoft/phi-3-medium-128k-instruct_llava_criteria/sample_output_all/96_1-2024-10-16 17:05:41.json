    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The artwork you're describing appears to be from the Impressionist movement, which emerged in the late 19th century. The Impressionist movement was characterized by its focus on capturing the fleeting effects of light and color in the natural world. Some unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to include:\n\n1. Loose brushwork: Impressionist artists used short, broken brushstrokes to capture the essence of a scene rather than focusing on details. This technique creates a sense of movement and spontaneity in the artwork.\n\n2. Bright, vibrant colors: Impressionist paintings often feature bright, vibrant colors that are applied in small, broken dabs or strokes. This technique was a departure from the more subdued, muted colors of earlier art movements.\n\n3. Light and shadow: Impressionist artists were interested in capturing the changing effects of light and shadow on a scene, so they often painted en plein air (outdoors) to capture the natural light and atmosphere.\n\n4. Ordinary subject matter: Impressionist artists often focused on everyday life and scenes, such as landscapes, cityscapes, and people going about their daily lives, rather than historical or mythological scenes.\n\n5. Atmosphere and mood, which creates a sense of depth and atmosphere.\n\n6. Unconventional compositions: Impressionist artists often used unusual compositions, such as cropping or off-of-focus, to create a sense of movement and spontaneity in the artwork.\n\nSome of the most famous Impressionist artists include Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste. Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Edgar Degas.\n\nIf the artwork you're describing has some of these features, it's likely an Impressionist in style.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
