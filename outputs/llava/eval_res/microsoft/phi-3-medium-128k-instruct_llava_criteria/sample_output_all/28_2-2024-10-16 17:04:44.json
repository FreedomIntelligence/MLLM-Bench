    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the type of dance based on dancers' attire and movement.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The description of dancers' attire and movement could correspond to a variety of dance styles. However, if we assume the dancers are wearing traditional Indian attire (like sarees for women and kurta pajamas for men) and performing intricate footwork with hand gestures, the dance style could likely be Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance. If the dancers are wearing flowing dresses and performing smooth, graceful movements, it could be ballet. If the dancers are wearing loose-fitting clothes and performing rhythmic, hip-oriented movements, it could be hip-hop or contemporary dance. More specific details would be needed to accurately identify the dance style.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe type of dance depicted in the image is ballet, as the male and female dancers are wearing black clothing and demonstrating graceful movements characteristic of ballet. The man is lifting the woman in a split while standing, and she is reaching upwards with her arms, which are typical ballet positions and techniques. The dancers' black attire also suggests a formal or professional performance, further supporting the notion that they are participating in a ballet routine.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify dance type by analyzing attire, such as dress style and shoes.\n2. Assess the dance based on visible movement, like posture and interaction.\n3. Ensure the answer is specific to the image, not a generic dance description.",
