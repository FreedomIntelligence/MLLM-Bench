    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The image shows a person performing the \"Bicep Curl\" exercise. This exercise primarily targets the biceps brachii, a muscle located in the upper arm.\n\nTechnical Essentials:\n\n1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing forward and elbows close to the torso.\n2. Keep your upper arms stationary, exhale, and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. The forearms should move, but the upper arms should remain still.\n3. Continue to raise the weights until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment.\n4. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\nImportant Tips:\n\n- Keep your elbows close to your sides and avoid swinging the weights.\n- Maintain a slight bend in your knees and engage your core muscles for stability.\n- Use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with proper form and control.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
