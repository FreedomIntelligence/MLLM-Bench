    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the information provided, it's difficult to predict the next stage without knowing the context of the trend or the data that will be represented in the graph. However, I can provide a general approach to analyzing trends and predicting future stages.\n\n1. Identify the variables: Determine the variables that are being measured in the graph (e.g., time, sales, population, etc.).\n\n2. Observe the trend: Look for patterns in the data, such as increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating trends.\n\n3. Determine the type of trend: Is the trend linear (a straight line), exponential (curved), or cyclical (repeating patterns)?\n\n4. Analyze the rate of change: Examine how quickly the trend is changing over time. Is it accelerating, decelerating, or remaining constant?\n\n5. Consider external factors: Are there any external factors that could influence the trend, such as seasonal changes, economic conditions, or technological advancements?\n\n6. Use statistical methods: Apply statistical methods like regression analysis, time series analysis, or forecasting models to estimate the future values of the trend.\n\n7. Make a prediction: Based on the analysis, make an informed prediction about the next stage of the trend. However, keep in mind that predictions are not always accurate and should be taken with a degree of uncertainty.\n\nTo provide a more specific prediction, please provide more context or details about the trend or data that will be represented in the graph.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
