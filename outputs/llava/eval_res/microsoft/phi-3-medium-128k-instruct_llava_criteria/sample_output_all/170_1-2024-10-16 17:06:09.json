Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhere is the pink queen located on the chessboard?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe pink queen is located in the middle of the chessboard.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The Pink Queen is not an official chess piece; it's a playful term sometimes used to refer to the Queen piece when it's pink in color, usually in chess sets designed for children or decorative ones. In a standard chess set, the Queen is either white or black, and it starts on the square of its own color (d1 for white, d8 for black or black).\n\nIf you have a chess set where the Queen is pink, please refer to the standard chessboard coordinates to find its location. The Queen starts on the d-file, so if it's the white Queen, or on the d-file on the 8th rank, if it's the black Queen.\n\nRemember, the chessboard coordinates run from a1 for the first column, to h for the last, and from 1 for the first row, to 8 if you are using the algebraic notation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm pink queen is on the fourth square from the left in the top row.",
