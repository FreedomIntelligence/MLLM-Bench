    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image depicts a scene of utter chaos with extensive damage visible throughout. Could you surmise which type of natural disaster has befallen this village?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the description of extensive damage and utter chaos, it is challenging to determine the exact type of natural disaster without visual confirmation. However, I can provide a few possibilities:\n\n1. Earthquake: Significant structural damage to buildings, roads, and bridges, as well as landslides or ground ruptures, could indicate an earthquake.\n\n2. Flood: Widespread water damage, submerged buildings, and debris piles could suggest a severe flood, possibly caused by heavy rainfall, a storm surge, or a dam breach.\n\n3. Tornado: Destruction of structures, uprooted trees, and scattered debris could point to a tornado, particularly if the damage is concentrated in a narrow path.\n\n4. Hurricane: Coastal flooding, wind damage, and storm surge could imply a hurricane, especially if the village is located near a coast.\n\n5. Wildfire: Burned vegetation, destroyed buildings, and ash-covered ground could indicate a wildfire, particularly if the village is surrounded by forests or grasslands.\n\nRemember, this is just a speculative assessment based on the description provided. To accurately identify the natural disaster, visual confirmation or additional information would be necessary.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image suggests that a major flood has taken place in the village. People are seen walking in the floodwaters, and the destruction appears to be extensive, with buildings surrounded by rough water, vehicles submerged, and debris scattered around. The force of the floodwater and the extent of the destruction indicate that this is a severe natural disaster, impacting the lives of the residents and the overall infrastructure of the village.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the natural disaster as a flood, based on water inundation and damage.\n2. Mention visible flood characteristics: fast-flowing water, debris, and affected buildings.",
