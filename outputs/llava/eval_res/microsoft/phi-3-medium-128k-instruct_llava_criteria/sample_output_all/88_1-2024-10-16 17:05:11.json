    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the device in the picture and describe the functionality and usage of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a device known as an electric screwdriver, which is being used to drill into metal. Electric screwdrivers are typically used in a wide range of professional settings for applications such as screwing or drilling in metal or similar materials. They offer a more convenient and efficient alternative to traditional manual tools, as they can deliver consistent and precise torque with a button press. The electric screwdriver can be especially useful for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as drilling screws into sheet metal, assembly, and disassembly tasks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to view or analyze images directly. However, I can help you identify and describe various electronic devices based on their descriptions. If you can provide a detailed description of the device, I'd be more than happy to assist you.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the device as a linear rail system.\n2. Describe the linear rail system's functionality accurately.\n3. Explain the usage of the linear rail system in context.",
