    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nObserving the vehicle, what event could have resulted in such a scenario?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Upon observing a vehicle with a flat tire and a dented fender, it's plausible to infer that the vehicle was involved in a minor collision. The dented fender suggests that the impact was significant enough to deform the metal, but not severe enough to cause a total loss of the vehicle. The flat tire could have resulted either from the collision or from running over a sharp object on the road.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the vehicle is driving in mid-air, surrounded by a massive amount of snow blown up into the air, and trees are also visible in the background. This could be the result of the vehicle driving through a snowstorm or a sudden snow blizzard, where the high winds and heavy snowfall have caused snow to be blown up in the air around the vehicle. The large amount of snow and the potential risk of visibility issues could be dangerous for the driver, making such a situation potentially hazardous if not handled with caution.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention \"avalanche\" as the event causing the scenario.\n2. Describe the vehicle's interaction with the snow indicating an avalanche (e.g. the vehicle is partially underneath the snow)",
