    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Upon inspecting the racquet, I've noticed several areas that may require attention for repair. Here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Grip Tape: If the grip tape is worn out or damaged, it's essential to replace it to maintain a firm and comfortable grip. You can purchase new grip tape from a sports store and follow the manufacturer's instructions to replace it.\n\n2. Stringing: If the strings are broken or frayed, consider restringing the racquet. This will improve your control and power during play.\n\n3. Frame Damage: If there are any cracks or dents in the frame, it might be best to consult a professional for repair. Minor damage can often be fixed by a professional, but severe damage might require a replacement.\n\n4. Tension: If the racquet's tension is inconsistent or too loose, consider re-stringing the racquet with the appropriate tension for your playing style.\n\n5. Weight: If the racquet feels too heavy or too light, you can adjust the string tension to change the weight.\n\n6. Head Size: If the head size is causing issues with your gameplay, consider switching to a racquet with a different head size. A larger head size can provide a larger sweet spot, while a smaller head size can offer more control.\n\n7. Balance: If the racquet's balance is causing issues, consider switching to a racquet with a different balance point. A head-heavy racquet offers more power, while a head-light racquet offers more control.\n\n8. String Type: If you're experiencing issues with the string's durability or feel, consider trying a different string type.\n\n9. Grommets: If the grommets are damaged or worn out, they should be replaced to ensure the strings stay in place.\n\n10. Handle: If the handle is damaged or worn out, you can replace it with a new one. Make sure to choose a handle that fits your racquet's head size and is comfortable for your grip.\n\nRemember, regular maintenance and proper care can help extend the lifespan of your racquet and ensure optimal performance. Always consult with a professional if you're unsure about any repairs or adjustments.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
