    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the facial expression of the woman in the picture and explain how you get your conclusion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe woman in the picture has a smiling facial expression with her eyes open wide. Her lips are slightly parted, revealing her teeth, and her eyelashes are fluttering. The combination of her eyes, lips, and teeth creates a warm, joyful, and inviting demeanor. This facial expression conveys a positive and friendly impression, which suggests that she is happy and comfortable in the moment captured in the photo.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To recognize the facial expression of the woman in the picture, I would first examine her facial features, such as the position of her eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and overall posture.\n\nFor example, if her eyebrows are raised, her eyes are wide open, and her mouth is slightly open, it may indicate surprise or shock. If her eyebrows are furrowed and her mouth is in a frown, it might suggest anger or frustration. Alternatively, if her eyebrows are relaxed, her eyes are bright, and her mouth is curved upwards, it could indicate happiness or joy.\n\nIn this hypothetical picture, let's say her eyebrows are slightly raised, her eyes are wide open with a slight squint, and her mouth is curved into a gentle smile, it would suggest that she is feeling curious or amused.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, I would analyze the context of the image, the woman's body language, and her facial features. The context of the image might provide clues about the situation she is in, which could help interpret her expression. If she is looking at something unexpected or intriguing, it could explain her curious expression. Additionally, her body language could provide further insight into her emotional state, such as a tilted head or an open posture, indicating an open and engaged attitude.\n\nIn conclusion, through careful observation of her facial features, body language, and the context of the image, I can recognize the facial expression of the woman as curious or amused.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the woman's facial expression as a smile, referencing the mouth and corners of her eyes.\n2. Explain the recognition process, mentioning visible teeth and eye crinkles.\n",
