    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Upon reviewing the floor plan, it appears that the design has taken privacy and accessibility into account effectively. The bedrooms are situated away from the main entrance and communal areas, ensuring a degree of seclusion and quiet. The placement of the bedrooms at the back of the house also provides a natural barrier between the private and public spaces.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, the bedrooms are well-connected to the bathrooms and the hallway, which leads to the living areas. The use of a central hallway allows for easy movement from one room to another, including the bedrooms. Additionally, the placement of windows in the bedrooms provides natural light and ventilation, contributing to the overall comfort of the space.\n\nOverall, the floor plan seems to have a good balance between privacy and accessibility, with the bedrooms offering a peaceful retreat while still being easily accessible to the communal areas.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
