    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Upon examining the image, we can observe three individuals: a man and two women. The man, positioned centrally, appears to be in a teaching or instructing role. His open stance, direct eye contact, and hand gestures suggest he is actively engaged in communication, possibly explaining or demonstrating something. His relaxed posture and the slight smile on his face indicate that he is comfortable and confident in his position.\n\nThe first woman on the left seems to be attentively listening. Her body is slightly leaning forward, which suggests interest and engagement. Her facial expression is neutral but her eyes are focused, indicating that she is concentrating on the man's words.\n\nThe second woman, woman on the right, appears to be taking notes. Her posture is slightly hunched over her attention is directed at the man, suggesting that she is actively absorbing the information being shared with the man. The slight frown on her face suggests that she is thinking deeply or perhaps about what the man is saying.\n\nThe interaction between the three individuals seems to be a professional or a teaching or learning scenario, with the man taking on the role of teacher or instructor, and the second woman as an active learner, while the first woman appears to be an observer or passive, possibly reflecting on the information being shared.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
