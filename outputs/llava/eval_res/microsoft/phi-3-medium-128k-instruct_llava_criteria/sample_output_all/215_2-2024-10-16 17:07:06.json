    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n This chart implies that there is a relationship or correlation between the two variables being compared. However, without more specific information about the chart, it's challenging to determine the exact nature of the relationship or correlation.\n\nHere are a few possible interpretations based on common types of charts:\n\n1. Line chart: If the chart is a line chart, it might show the trend of one variable over time or its relationship with another variable. For example, it could represent the change in sales over a year or the correlation between temperature and ice cream sales.\n\n2. Bar chart: If it's a bar chart, it could be comparing the values of two or more variables, such as the sales of different products or the performance of different teams.\n\n3. Pie chart: If the chart is a pie chart, it might be showing the proportion of a whole that each variable represents, such as the market share of different companies or the percentage of a budget allocated to different departments.\n\n4. Scatter plot: If it's a scatter plot, it could be showing the relationship between two continuous variables, such as the correlation between height and weight, or between advertising spend and sales.\n\n5. Heat map: If it's a heat map, it might be showing the intensity of some phenomenon across a two-dimensional space, such as the concentration of pollution in different areas of a city or the frequency of customer complaints across different product categories.\n\nIn any case, the chart should include a title, labels for the axes (if applicable), a legend (if necessary), and any other relevant information to help the viewer understand the data being presented. The chart should also be designed to be clear and easy to interpret, with appropriate scaling and coloring to highlight important trends or relationships.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
