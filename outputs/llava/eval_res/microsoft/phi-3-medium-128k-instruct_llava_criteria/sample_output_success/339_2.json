    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the computer screen and provide possible ways to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To evaluate the damage of the computer screen, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Visually inspect the screen: Check for any physical damage such as cracks, dents, or scratches on the screen surface.\n\n2. Verify the functionality: Check if the screen is displaying any images, colors, or if there are any distortions, lines, or flickering.\n\n3. Check the connection: Ensure that the screen is properly connected to the computer. Loose or damaged cables can cause display issues.\n\nPossible ways to repair the computer screen:\n\n1. If there are minor scratches or dents, you can try using a screen repair kit. These kits typically contain a special adhesive that can fill in the scratches or dents.\n\n2. If the screen has a small crack, it is possible to repair it using a screen repair patch. These patches are made of a clear, flexible material that can be applied over the crack.\n\n3. If the screen is flickering or displaying distorted images, it could be a problem with the video cable or the graphics card. Try reseating the cable or replacing it with a new one. If the issue persists, you may need to replace the graphics card.\n\n4. If the screen is completely non-functional, it is likely that the LCD panel needs to be replaced. This is a more complex repair and may require professional assistance.\n\n5. If the screen is physically damaged, such as having large cracks or dents, it is recommended to replace the entire screen.\n\nRemember to always exercise caution when attempting to repair a computer screen, as it can be delicate and sensitive to static electricity. If you are unsure about the repair process, it is best to consult with a professional technician.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe computer screen in the image is severely cracked and shattered, with multiple spider cracks spread across the surface. The damage poses a significant risk to the display and may impact the functionality of the screen.\n\nTo repair this screen, there are a few options:\n\n1. Replacement: The most straightforward solution is to replace the damaged screen with a brand new one, either from Apple or a third-party supplier. This option might be costly, depending on the model and availability of the screen.\n\n2. Repair: In some cases, professional repair services can fix the cracked screen by carefully removing the damaged glass and replacing it with a new one. However, this may not be possible for severely cracked or shattered screens due to the potential internal damage to the display components.\n\n3. DIY Repair: If the damage is not too severe and the screen is not completely shattered, some users may attempt to fix the screen by following the repair guides available online. However, this method is generally not recommended, as it may lead to further damage and void any warranties.\n\nIt is important to note that attempting to use a cracked, shattered, or damaged screen may cause it to deteriorate further and potentially cause additional damages to the device's components, such as the motherboard or other internal parts. It is crucial to assess the level of damage and consider professional repair or replacement options.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the extent and location of the screen damage.\n2. Suggest realistic repair methods for the identified damage.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the instruction's focus on evaluation and repair.",
