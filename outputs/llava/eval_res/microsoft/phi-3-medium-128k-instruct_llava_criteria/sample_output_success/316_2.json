    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease tell me what the answer to this question is and show me the step by step reasoning process\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To provide an answer and the step-by-step reasoning process, I would need a specific question to address. Please provide the question you would like me to help you with.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe answer to the mathematical problem presented is 1/4. To arrive at this answer, follow these steps:\n\n1. Multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction (1/3) by 2, which gives us 2/3.\n2. Divide the numerator of the second fraction (1/2) by the denominator of the first fraction (3) to get 1/6.\n3. Cross-multiply the fractions, which involves multiplying the numerator of 1/6 by the denominator of the first fraction (3) and the denominator of 1/6 by the numerator of the first fraction (1). This results in 3/6 and 3/1, respectively.\n4. Add the two fractions, which gives us 6/6.\n5. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6, resulting in 1/2.\n6. Multiply the first fraction (1/3) by 1/2 to get 1/6.\n7. Divide the numerator of the third fraction (1/3) by the denominator of the second fraction (2) to get 1/6.\n8. Cross-multiply the fractions, which involves multiplying the numerator of the second fraction (1/2) by the denominator of the second fraction (2) and the denominator of the first fraction (3) by the numerator of the third fraction (1/3). This gives us (1/6) and (3/6), respectively.\n9. Add the two fractions, which gives us 4/6.\n10. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6, resulting in 2/3.\n11. Combine the two fractions with a common denominator (4) by adding the numerators and denominators. This results in 1/4 as the answer.\n\nThe reasoning process involves following the rules of arithmetic and simplifying fractions to arrive at the final answer of 1/4.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct final answer: -1.\n2. Explanation includes identifying equations and solving for x, y, z.\n3. Reasoning process shows step-by-step algebraic manipulation.",
