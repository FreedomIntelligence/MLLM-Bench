    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the hands of the anime character and briefly describe the use and techniques of this object.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The object in the hands of the anime character is a katana, a traditional Japanese sword. It is a curved, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard.\n\nThe katana is primarily used for cutting, slashing, and occasionally thrusting. The techniques used with a katana include:\n\n1. Iai: This is the basic technique of drawing the katana from its scabbard, known as the saya. The practitioner must be able to draw and cut in one smooth motion.\n\n2. Kesa-giri: A downward diagonal cut, often used to target an opponent's head or neck.\n\n3. Tatehiza: A stance where the practitioner kneels on one knee with the other foot flat on the ground, allowing for better reach and control of the katana.\n\n4. Kirikaeshi: A training exercise involving repetitive cuts with the katana, aimed at improving technique and precision.\n\n5. Kesa-giri-uchi: A combination technique where the practitioner performs a kesa-giri cut and immediately follows it with a horizontal cut, known as uchi.\n\n6. Chudan-zuki: A mid-level thrust aimed at the opponent's torso, often used in conjunction with other cutting techniques.\n\n7. Kote-uchi: A cut aimed at the opponent's wrist, intended to disarm them.\n\n8. Nagashi: A defensive technique where the practitioner guides or redirects the opponent's attacking sword away from their body.\n\n9. Uke-uchi: A blocking technique where the practitioner uses the katana to deflect or stop an incoming attack.\n\n10. Atemi: Striking techniques used to distract or disorient the opponent, often in combination with cutting or thrusting techniques.\n\nThese techniques are typically learned and practiced within the context of various martial arts schools (ryuha) and styles (ryu), such as Kenjutsu, Iaido, and Kendo.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe anime character is holding a trombone, which is a musical instrument used to produce sound by vibrating the air inside it. The trombone is made of a long metal tube, with a flared bell at the end, and has a sliding mechanism that allows the player to change notes. The trombone uses brass and slide techniques to produce various tones and notes, making it a versatile instrument in different musical genres such as jazz, classical, and military marching bands.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a saxophone.\n2. Describe the saxophone's use as a musical instrument.\n3. Mention the technique of blowing into it to produce sound.",
