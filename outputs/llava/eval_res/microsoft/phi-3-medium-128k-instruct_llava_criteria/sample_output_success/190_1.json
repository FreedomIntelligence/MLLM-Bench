    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the details in the image and determine the gestational age of the fetus by measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) and comparing it to standard growth charts.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a black and white view of a pregnant human uterus, with multiple sections visible. A blue ball, representing the fetus, is inside the uterus. To determine the gestational age of the fetus, we can calculate the crown-rump length (CRL). The CRL measures the distance from the top of the fetal head (crown) to the end of the tailbone (rump).\n\nComparing the CRL measurement to standard growth charts, which usually have a scale starting from week 6 and ending at week 40, one can determine the gestational age. For instance, if the CRL is approximately 4 centimeters, it would indicate that the fetus is likely at around 18 weeks of gestation. However, it is important to note that the exact gestational age can only be determined by a healthcare provider through ultrasound or other methods.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n In the provided image, we can observe a fetus in a transverse view, floating within the amniotic fluid. The fetus appears to be in a curled-up position, with its arms and legs drawn close to its body. The head is slightly tilted, and its face is visible with closed eyes. The spine is clearly visible as a smooth curve, and the umbilical cord is attached to the abdomen.\n\nTo determine the gestational age of the fetus, we need to measure the crown-rump length (CRL), which is the distance from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). The CRL measurement is a reliable indicator of gestational age during the first trimester.\n\nAssuming the image provides a clear view of the fetus and its dimensions, let's say the CRL measures 35mm. Based on standard fetal growth charts, a CRL of 35mm corresponds to a gestational age of approximately 9 weeks. These charts are based on large studies of pregnant women and their fetuses, and they show the average CRL for each week of gestation.\n\nIt is essential to keep in mind that individual differences in fetal growth rates may cause slight variations in CRL measurements. However, these charts provide a useful reference for estimating gestational age based on CRL measurements.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the image, noting it's a CT scan, not an ultrasound for CRL measurement.\n2. Explain that CRL is used for gestational age, but not applicable in this CT image.\n3. State that gestational age cannot be determined from the provided CT image.",
