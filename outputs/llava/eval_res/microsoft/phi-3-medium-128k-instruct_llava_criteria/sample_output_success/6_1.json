    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the fish-like object in the image and indicate the use case of the item.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a stuffed fish-like object lying on the bed next to the pillows. This object, which appears to be a stuffed crocodile, serves as a decorative piece or a toy. It might be a comforting item for the person who sleeps in the bed, adding a touch of personalization and warmth to the space. Additionally, it can also serve as a toy for a child or a simple collectible item for an individual who enjoys such objects.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The fish-like object in the image is likely a \"sushi roll\" or \"nigiri sushi,\" which is a popular dish from Japanese cuisine. \n\nSushi rolls are made by placing a layer of sushi rice on a sheet of nori (seaweed) and then adding various ingredients such as fish, vegetables, and other toppings. The roll is then shaped into a cylinder and sliced into bite-sized pieces.\n\nNigiri sushi, on the other hand, consists of a small ball of sushi rice topped with a slice of raw fish, such as salmon, tuna, or eel.\n\nBoth types of sushi are commonly served in Japanese restaurants and are enjoyed by people worldwide. They are often eaten as a light meal or as an appetizer and can be found in various forms, such as hand rolls, temaki (cone-shaped rolls), and sashimi (sliced raw fish without rice).\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the fish-like object as a pillow\n2. Confirm the object's decorative purpose.",
