    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine if the image is real or AI-generated and provide your explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n As an AI, I'm unable to view images directly. However, you can describe the image to me, and I can help you analyze it based on the description. If you provide details about the image, such as its content, style, and context, I can help you determine if it is likely to be real or AI-generated based on certain characteristics and patterns. Keep in mind that while I can make an educated guess, without seeing the image, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is AI-generated. The reason behind this conclusion is that it appears to be a fantastical scene with a giant wave crashing into a city, causing buildings to topple over. In reality, such a large wave is unlikely to occur, as the ocean's waves typically do not reach the height of buildings or cause them to collapse. The fact that this image evokes a sense of wonder and seems to be visually inconsistent with real-life physics suggests that it was created using artificial intelligence, most likely using a computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the image is identified as AI-generated.\n2. Evaluate the explanation for unnatural elements or inconsistencies in the image.\n3. Check for logical analysis of the image's authenticity based on visual cues.",
