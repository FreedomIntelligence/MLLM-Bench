    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements in the image that contribute to the humorous effect and develop a backstory that leads up to the moment captured in the meme.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a miniature painting of a man wearing a tuxedo, possibly a portrait of a famous person. Next to the painting, there's a small dog sitting in front of it, appearing as if it were smiling at the viewer. The humorous aspect in the scene comes from the juxtaposition between the serious and formal nature of the man's portrait and the lighthearted demeanor of the dog.\n\nAs for the backstory, we can imagine that the owner of the dog has a sense of humor and decided to create this whimsical scene. They placed the painting of the man in a prominent position where everyone could see and admire the work, while the dog was placed intentionally in front of the portrait to create a playful and unexpected interaction between the viewer and the scene. To enhance the humorous effect, the dog has been trained to pose as if smiling, adding to the amusing atmosphere of the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Image: A dog wearing a graduation cap and gown, sitting in front of a chalkboard with the words \"Math\" and \"Fail\" written on it.\n\nElements contributing to the humorous effect:\n1. The dog wearing a graduation cap and gown: This juxtaposition of a dog in human attire creates a humorous visual.\n2. The chalkboard with the words \"Math\" and \"Fail\": The contrast between the dog's graduation attire and the \"fail\" message on the chalkboard creates an ironic twist.\n3. The dog's expression: The dog's surprised and slightly embarrassed expression adds to the humor.\n\nBackstory:\n\nMeet Max, a lovable and mischievous golden retriever who lives with his owner, Emily. Emily is a math teacher who spends her days teaching high school students complex equations and formulas. Max, on the other hand, is more interested in chasing squirrels and playing fetch than solving math problems.\n\nOne day, Emily decides to have some fun with Max and dresses him up in a graduation cap and gown. She places him in front of her chalkboard and, with a twinkle in her eye, writes \"Math\" and \"Fail\" on it. She takes a picture of Max with the chalkboard and shares it on social media, captioning it, \"Max's first day of college!\"\n\nThe image quickly goes viral, with people all over the world laughing at Max's adorable and humorous graduation photo. Emily decides to turn the meme into a series, with Max attending different classes, such as \"Science\" and \"History,\" always with a \"Fail\" message on the chalkboard.\n\nAs the memes continue to spread, Max becomes a celebrity, and Emily starts receiving offers to create merchandise with Max's pictures. Despite the fame, Max remains the same lovable, mischievous dog he always was, and Emily continues to share their humorous adventures with the world.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify juxtaposition of dog's face on a suited body in the painting and the real dog, explaining the humor.\n2. Create a backstory involving the dog's imagined wealthy lifestyle after a payday.\n3. Include reference to the caption's play on \"payday\" and \"unnecessary things.",
