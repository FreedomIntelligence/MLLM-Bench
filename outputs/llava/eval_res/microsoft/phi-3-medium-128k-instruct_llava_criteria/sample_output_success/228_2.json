    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the natural relationship that the creature in the image shows.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to view images. However, I can help you identify the natural relationship between creatures if you describe the image or the species involved. For instance, you could tell me about their behaviors, physical characteristics, or their roles in an ecosystem, and I can provide you with information on their natural relationships.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe creature in the image is a crab, which exhibits a natural relationship with its surroundings as a marine animal. It can be seen standing on a large rock under the water in an oceanside setting, with its body covered in red markings, typical of the crab's distinctive appearance. This environment provides the crab with shelter, food, and protection from predators. The crab's location near the ocean also indicates its adaptation to aquatic habitats, demonstrating its ability to live and thrive in various marine environments.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the creature as a hermit crab using a shell; reference commensalism.\n2. Answer must reflect understanding of natural relationships, not just identification.",
