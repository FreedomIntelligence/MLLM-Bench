    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the upper side and lower side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To conduct this task, I would need access to the actual images to compare and find the differences. Since this is a text-based platform and I don't have the ability to view images, I'm unable to directly examine and compare them.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to find differences between two images:\n\n1. **Look for color changes**: Check if there are any areas where the color or shading is different between the two images.\n\n2. **Search for added or missing elements**: Look for any objects, shapes, or figures that are present in one image but not in the other.\n\n3. **Check for altered shapes or sizes**: Observe if any shapes or objects have different sizes or forms in the two images.\n\n4. **Pay attention to text and labels**: If there is any text or labels in the images, compare them to see if there are differences in the content, font, or placement.\n\n5. **Examine the background**: Sometimes differences can be found in the background details, such as patterns, shadows, or subtle changes in the environment.\n\n6. **Look for changes in lighting or shadows**: Differences in the angle or intensity of lighting can create discrepancies between two images.\n\n7. **Check for symmetry**: If the images are supposed to be symmetrical, any asymmetry could be a difference.\n\n8. **Compare the position of elements**: If there are multiple elements, their position relative to each other can be a source of difference.\n\n9. **Look for changes in perspective**: If the images are of the same scene from different angles, the perspective might be altered.\n\n10. **Check for subtle details**: Sometimes, the differences are very small and require a keen eye to spot.\n\nRemember to take your time and examine each part of the images carefully. If you have the images available, you can use these guidelines to find the 5 differences. If you can provide a description or context of the images, I might be able to help you deduce potential differences, but I would need more information to do so.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the upper side of the image, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones, whereas in the lower side, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones. However, the differences between the two images include the poses of the people and the layout of the table. The people in the upper image are in different poses and are not all in the same positions as in the lower image. There is also a bottle visible in both images, but its placement on the table is different. Additionally, the presence of a dining table and chairs is common to both images, but the design or style of the table and chairs may differ.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in logo direction, object colors in hand, right foot direction, hair style, and chair legs.",
