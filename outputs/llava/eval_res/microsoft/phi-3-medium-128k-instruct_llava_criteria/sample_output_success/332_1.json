    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess vehicles' damage in the image, and rank them in order of damage severity\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several vehicles that have sustained damage during the accident. They are:\n\n1. A car in the middle of the scene, which has almost been T-boned and appears to be significantly damaged.\n2. Two cars in the foreground, which seem to have been involved in the collision. One car has a broken windshield and the other seems to be significantly damaged as well.\n3. A car near the right side of the scene, which has sustained some damage.\n4. A car at the far right side of the scene, which appears to be relatively undamaged compared to the other cars involved in the accident.\n\nIt is important to note that there might be other cars in the scene that have sustained damage, but they are not as visible or identifiable as the above vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To assess the vehicles' damage in the image and rank them in order of damage severity, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the image: First, I would closely examine the image to identify the vehicles involved in the accident.\n\n2. Identify the damage: I would observe and note the visible damages on each vehicle, such as dents, scratches, broken glass, bent frames, or any other visible signs of impact.\n\n3. Rank the damage: Based on the severity of the damages observed, I would rank the vehicles in descending order of damage severity.\n\n4. Consider the impact points: I would also consider the impact points on each vehicle, as this can give insights into the force of the collision and the potential damage to the vehicle's structure.\n\n5. Evaluate the safety of the occupants: If possible, I would try to determine if any occupants were present during the accident and if they were wearing seat belts, as this can also help assess the severity of the accident.\n\nAssuming there are three vehicles involved in the accident, here's a hypothetical ranking based on the damage severity:\n\n1. Vehicle A: This vehicle has significant damage to its front end, with a crumpled hood, shattered windshield, and damaged front bumper. The front-right corner of the vehicle appears to have sustained the most impact, suggesting that it was hit from the side. The damage is severe enough to indicate that the vehicle was hit head-on by another vehicle.\n\n2. Vehicle B: This vehicle has moderate damage, with a dented front bumper, broken headlight, and minor scratches on the side. The damage is less severe than Vehicle A, indicating that it was hit by Vehicle A.\n\n3. Vehicle C: This vehicle has minor scratches on its rear bumper, suggesting that it was hit from behind by Vehicle B. The damage is relatively minor compared to the other two vehicles.\n\nPlease note that this ranking is based on a hypothetical scenario, and the actual ranking could vary depending on the specific details of the accident. Additionally, it's essential to consider other factors, such as the safety of the occupants and the speed of the vehicles involved, to fully understand the severity of the accident.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if red vehicle has severe head section damage, silver vehicle has visible rear damage.\n2. Rank vehicles' damage severity correctly as answer: red vehicle (severe damage to its head section) > silver vehicle (visible rear damage).\n3. Evaluate damage without identifying or making statements about people.",
