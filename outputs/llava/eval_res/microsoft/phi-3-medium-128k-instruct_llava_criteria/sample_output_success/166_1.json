    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Headline: \"NASA Successfully Lands Perseverance Rover on Mars\"\n\nMain Point: NASA's Perseverance rover has successfully landed on Mars.\n\nBroader Context: The Perseverance rover, part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission, was launched on July 17, 2020, and landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. This mission aims to search for signs of ancient microbial life, collect rocky and cache samples of Martian rocks and soil, and demonstrate new technologies for future robotic exploration. The successful landing of the Perseverance rover marks an important milestone in space exploration and furthers our understanding of the Red Planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3.
