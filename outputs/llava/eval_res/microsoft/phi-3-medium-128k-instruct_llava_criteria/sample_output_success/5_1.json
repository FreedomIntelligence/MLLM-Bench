    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and point out the difference between it and the general fan.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a portable space heater, often referred to as a small stove, sitting next to a black control panel. The heater has a circular fan next to it that can be used for direct heating of a small area. This is different from a general fan, as the heater is designed for providing warmth and comfort instead of just circulating air or cooling. The heater and the fan are both black and compact, making them suitable for personal use and travel. However, the heater is specifically designed for heating purposes and is not a general appliance like a regular fan.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The object in the image appears to be a ceiling fan. The main difference between a ceiling fan and a general fan is their placement and mounting. A ceiling fan is mounted on the ceiling and typically has a longer blade span, while a general fan, like a tabletop fan or a tower fan, is usually freestanding and smaller in size. Ceiling fans are designed to be installed on the ceiling, providing air circulation for a larger area, whereas general fans are portable and can be placed anywhere in the room. Additionally, ceiling fans often have a motor and blades mounted on a central hub, while general fans have a base and a single motor that drives the blades.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a heater, not a fan.\n2. Note the heater's heat emission, contrasting with a fan's air circulation.",
