    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the picture, there are a few potential reasons why the circuit board may be unusable:\n\n1. Physical damage: If the board has visible cracks, burns, or other signs of damage, it's possible that the board has been physically damaged, which could have caused a short circuit or broken connections. This could be due to mishandling, dropping, or exposure to extreme temperatures.\n2. Overheating: If the board was subjected to excessive heat, components may have been damaged or melted, making it non-functional.\n3. Water exposure: Water can cause corrosion, short circuits, or damage to the solder joints, rendering the board unusable.\n4. Overvoltage or power surge: Exposing the board to voltages beyond its specified limits can cause components to fail or become damaged.\n5. Component failure: Components, such as capacitors, resistors, or integrated circuits, may have failed due to manufacturing defects or wear and tear.\n6. Poor soldering: Poor soldering can lead to weak or broken connections, causing the board to malfunction.\n\nWithout more specific information or the ability to inspect the board directly, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It's best to consult with a professional technician who can perform a thorough inspection and diagnose the issue.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
