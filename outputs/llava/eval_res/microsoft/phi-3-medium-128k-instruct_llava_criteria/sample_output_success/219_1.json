    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the metal that has the biggest price change in the heat map?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heat map, the metal with the biggest price change is gold.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Identifying the metal with the biggest price change in a heat map would require access to the specific heat map in question. However, I can provide a general approach on how to find this information.\n\nA heat map is a data visualization tool that uses color to represent the values of a matrix or data set. In the context of metal prices, the heat map might show the price change of various metals over a certain period.\n\nHere is a general approach to find the metal with the biggest price change:\n\n1. Look for each metal, identify the color that represents its price change. The color scheme should be different depending on the heat map (for example, red could mean a decrease or increase, blue could mean a decrease).\n\n2. Compare the color intensities consistent across the heat map? If they are, then compare the color intensities directly.\n\n3. If the color scheme (e.g., darker colors might represent larger price changes.\n\nOnce you've identified the color scheme, look for each metal, identify the color that represents its price change.\n\n4. Compare the color intensities across all metals. The metal with the darkest or most intense color-colored cell (depending on the color scheme) is likely to have the biggest price change.\n\nRemember, this is just a general approach. The actual method might differ depending on the specific heat map you are working with.\n\nIf you have the data or the heat map, I could provide more precise values or specifics.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the metal with the largest percentage change in the Metals section as silver.\n2. Specify the percentage change of silver as -3.60%.",
