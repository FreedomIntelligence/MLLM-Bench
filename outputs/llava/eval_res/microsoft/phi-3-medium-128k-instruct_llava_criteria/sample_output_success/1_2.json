    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the white objects in the image and determine their functionality.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to view images. However, I can help you identify white objects in an image if you describe the image to me. Once you provide a description, I can give you information on the possible functionality of the white objects mentioned.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a group of white snowmen, or snowflakes, and other white objects, such as cups and vases, arranged on a wooden dining table. These objects are designed as decorative items for the table, adding an element of festivity and charm to the setting. The snowflakes and snowmen may be part of a theme or an aesthetic choice, while the cups and vases serve as functional items for holding beverages or displaying flowers, respectively. Overall, the main focus of the image is the creative and decorative arrangement of these white objects on the tabletop.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all white objects as 'tumbler toys' accurately.\n2. Describe the functionality of tumbler toys correctly.\n3. Exclude non-white objects and irrelevant background items.",
