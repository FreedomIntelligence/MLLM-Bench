    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of wear of the headset, and infer the possible cause of the wear.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a person is holding a black headset with a fuzzy texture on the headband and ear pads. The headset appears to be worn down to the fabric, which indicates significant wear and tear. The possible cause of this wear could be regular use over a prolonged period, as headsets are often used daily by people engaged in activities such as gaming, listening to music, or participating in online meetings. The wear could also be a result of a lack of proper care, such as not regularly cleaning the headset or storing it in a dusty or poorly organized space. Overall, the headset's condition suggests that it has been used extensively and not well-maintained.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Upon evaluating the headset, I can observe that the headband appears to have moderate wear along its edges, with some fraying and slight stretching. The ear cups also show signs of wear, with the padding looking compressed and slightly discolored.\n\nThe possible causes of this wear could be:\n\n1. Frequent use: The headset has likely been used frequently, causing the materials to wear down over time.\n2. Improper storage: The headset may have been stored improperly, such as being left in a tightly packed bag or exposed to harsh conditions, leading to accelerated wear.\n3. Age: The headset may be relatively old and has reached the end of its lifespan, causing the materials to deteriorate.\n4. Poor quality materials: The materials used in the headset may not be of high quality, leading to faster wear and tear.\n5. Inadequate maintenance: The headset may not have been cleaned or maintained properly, causing the materials to degrade faster.\n\nTo prevent further wear, it is recommended to store the headset in a cool, dry place, avoid overstuffing storage bags, and clean the headset regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify wear on headset: peeling material, discoloration, deformation.\n2. Infer wear causes: usage, material quality, environmental factors.",
