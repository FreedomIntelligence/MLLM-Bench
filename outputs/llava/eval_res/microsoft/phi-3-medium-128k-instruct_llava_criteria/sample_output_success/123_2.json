    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the emotional significance of the embrace between the two individuals, paying close attention to their body language and facial expressions in the context of the setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The embrace between the two individuals appears to be a deeply emotional and intimate moment. The setting provides context for the embrace, allowing us to infer that it is likely a significant event for both parties involved.\n\nThe body language of the two individuals suggests a strong connection and a sense of comfort in each other's presence. They are standing close together, with their arms wrapped around each other in a tight embrace. Their bodies are leaning in towards each other, indicating a desire for closeness and intimacy.\n\nThe facial expressions of the two individuals also convey a range of emotions. They both have smiles on their faces, suggesting happiness and joy. However, there are also tears in their eyes, indicating that they may be experiencing a mix of emotions, including sadness, relief, or gratitude.\n\nThe setting of the embrace may also play a role in its emotional significance. If the two individuals are in a public setting, such as a wedding or a graduation ceremony, the embrace may be a celebration of a significant milestone in their lives. If they are in a private setting, such as a hospital room or a funeral, the embrace may be a moment of comfort and support during a difficult time.\n\nOverall, the embrace between the two individuals is a powerful and emotional moment, filled with a range of emotions and a deep sense of connection. The body language and facial expressions of the individuals, as well as the setting, all contribute to the emotional significance of the embrace.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, an older man and woman are hugging each other, which suggests a strong emotional connection between them. Their body language, as they hold each other in their arms tightly, demonstrates warmth, love, and affection. Their facial expressions, including smiles, show that they are happy and enjoying each other's company. The setting where they are hugging, which is an outdoor area with a building nearby, implies that they might be attending an event or gathering, further supporting the idea that the embrace signifies an important occasion or special moment in their lives. This act of affection between the elderly couple reflects the long-lasting and deep bond they share, serving as a reminder of the importance of love and companionship across different generations.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotions conveyed by facial expression of peacefulness indicating a sense of comfort and happiness\n2. Analyze the facial expression and body language",
