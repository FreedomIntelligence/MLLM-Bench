    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n In the image, there are two cats, a calico and a tabby, sitting side by side on a wooden porch. The calico cat has a beautiful coat with a mix of orange, black, and white patches, while the tabby has a pattern of stripes and spots on its brown and black fur. They are both looking out into a lush green garden, filled with various flowers and plants. The porch is made of weathered wood and has a few potted plants placed on the sides. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow over the scene, and there is a gentle breeze that causes the leaves on the nearby trees to rustle softly. In the background, there is a white picket fence enclosing the garden, and a small bird feeder hangs from a branch of a tree. The atmosphere is peaceful and serene, with the cats seemingly enjoying the tranquility of their surroundings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
