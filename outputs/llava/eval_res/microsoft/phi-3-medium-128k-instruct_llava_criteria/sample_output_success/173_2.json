Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhere is the white tablet?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n As an AI, I don't have the ability to physically locate objects. However, I can guide you on how to look for a white tablet. Here's a general process you can follow:\n\n1. Start by thinking about the last place you remember having the white tablet.\n\n2. Check the most common places you usually keep your electronics, such as on a desk, a shelf, or in a drawer.\n\n3. If you don't find it there, expand your search to other places where you might have used it recently.\n\n4. Ask family members or roommates if they've seen it.\n\n5. If it's still not found, try to recall any unusual places you might have left it.\n\n6. Use a tracking app, if your tablet has that feature enabled.\n\n7. If all else fails, check lost and found areas or contact your service provider in case it was turned in.\n\nRemember, the exact location can vary greatly depending on your habits and environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe white tablet is on a wooden table, placed next to the laptop.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm white tablet is identified as behind the computer.",
