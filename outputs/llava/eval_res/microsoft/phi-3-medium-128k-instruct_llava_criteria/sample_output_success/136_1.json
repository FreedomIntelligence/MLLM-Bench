    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the architectural style and cultural function of the indoor space depicted.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe indoor space depicted in the image appears to be a museum or a large gallery with a high architectural ceiling, which suggests that it is likely a historically significant or culturally relevant building. The large room features several paintings displayed on the walls, which further emphasizes its function as an art exhibition or museum. The people walking through the room and the seating area with individuals sitting on benches indicate that the space is open to the public, allowing visitors to appreciate the artworks and enjoy the atmosphere of the museum.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the description of the indoor space, it appears to be an example of Gothic architecture. This architectural style is characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, which were used to support the tall, slender structure of the building.\n\nThe cultural function of this indoor space could be a religious one, such as a cathedral or church. Gothic architecture was commonly used in religious buildings during the medieval period. The grandeur and ornate detailing of the Gothic style may have been intended to inspire awe and reverence in the congregationals, as well as to symbolize the power and wealth of the religious institution.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify architectural style elements like wall decor, ceiling, and lighting.\n2. Determine cultural function based on room contents and visitor activity.",
