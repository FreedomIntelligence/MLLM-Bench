    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The animal I am describing is the majestic Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). These magnificent creatures are the largest of the big cats and are native to the Indian subcontinent, with a few populations found in other parts of Asia as well. Here are some of the most distinctive features that can help you recognize a Bengal tiger:\n\n1. Color and Pattern: Bengal tigers have a striking orange coat with black stripes that are unique to each individual. The stripes are typically dark brown or black, and they run in parallel lines along their body. Their belly, face, and legs are white or cream-colored, creating a beautiful contrast against their orange fur. The stripes help them blend into their natural habitat, making them more difficult to spot by their prey.\n\n2. Size and Build: Adult male Bengal tigers can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length, including their tail, and weigh between 300-550 pounds (136-250 kilograms). They have a muscular build, with powerful legs and a strong, flexible spine that allows them to make quick and agile movements. Females are usually smaller, measuring up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length and weighing between 200-300 pounds (90-136 kilograms).\n\n3. Head: Their head is square-shaped with a broad forehead and a short, strong muzzle. Their eyes are a piercing amber or golden color, and they have small, rounded ears that are black on the back and white on the inside. The tiger's face is adorned with white markings on the cheeks, chin, and throat, which are known as \"whisker spots.\"\n\n4. Teeth and Claws: Like all big cats, Bengal tigers have sharp, retractable claws that they use for hunting and climbing. Their canine teeth can grow up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in length, which helps them take down their prey.\n\n5. Tail: The tail of a Bengal tiger is about 3 feet (0.9 meters) long and has a white tip, which helps them communicate with other tigers and maintain balance while running.\n\n6. Habitat: Bengal tigers are primarily found in dense forests, mangroves, and grasslands, where they can camouflage themselves effectively. They are solitary animals and prefer to live in areas with abundant prey, such as deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals. They are excellent swimmers and are also known to frequent water bodies.\n\n7. Behavior: Bengal tigers are solitary and territorial animals, with males having larger territories than females. They are most active at dawn and dusk, and they use scent marking to communicate with other tigers and establish their territories.\n\n8. Conservation Status: Unfortunately, Bengal tigers are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with only about 2,500 individuals remaining in the wild. They face threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.\n\nBy keeping these features in mind, you can help identify a Bengal tiger and contribute to their conservation efforts.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
