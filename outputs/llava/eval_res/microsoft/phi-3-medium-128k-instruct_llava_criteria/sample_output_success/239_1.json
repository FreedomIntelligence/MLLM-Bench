Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nFrom the Excel table in the image, what is the total quantity of products that customer 3449 bought on 12/31/1996?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nCustomer 3449 purchased 4 products on December 31, 1996. The relevant information can be found in the second column of the table where the date is 12/31/1996, and the third column identifies the customer as 3449. The fourth column shows that the customer bought four products.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to view or analyze images. However, I can guide you on how to find the total quantity of products that customer 3449 bought on 12/31/1996 in an Excel table.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Excel file containing the table.\n2. Click on the column header that contains the customer IDs to select the entire column.\n3. Go to the \"Data\" tab, then click on \"Filter\" in the \"Sort & Filter\" group. This will add dropdown arrows to each column header.\n4. Click on the dropdown arrow in the customer ID column and select \"3449\" to filter the table for this customer.\n5. Now, click on the column header that contains the dates and select \"12/31/1996\" to filter the table for this specific date.\n6. The table should now only display rows where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n7. Look for the column that contains the product quantities and sum them up.\n\nIf you need a more automated way, you can use the SUMIFS function in Excel. Here's an example assuming the columns are arranged as follows:\n\nColumn A: Customer ID\nColumn B: Date\nColumn C: Product Quantity\n\nThe formula would look like this:\n\n1. Open the Excel file.\n2. Use the column headers.\n3. Go to the \"Data\" tab, then click on \"Product Quantity\" in the \"Sort & Filter\" group.\n\n4. Now, look for the column that contains the product quantities and sum them up the \"SUMIFS\" function in Excel. Here's an example, assuming the columns are arranged as follows: Column A: Customer ID Column B: SUMIFS:Product Quantity\n\nThe formula would look like this:\n\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A, \"3449\", B:B \"12/31/C:C, A:A \"3449\", B: Customer ID: 3449, B:B \"12/31/3449\", B:B \"12/31/1996\")\n\n\nThis formula will return the total quantity of products that customer 34449 bought on 12/31/1996. The formula would look like this:\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A, \"3449\", B:B, \"12/31/1996\")\n\nThis formula will add up all the quantities in column C where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n\nRemember to replace the column references (C:C, A:A, and B:B) with the actual column numbers where your data is located.\n\n6. The formula would look like this:\n\n=SUMIFS(C:C, A:A \"3449\", B:B \"12/31.\n\nThis formula will add up all the quantities in column C where the customer ID is 3449 and the date is 12/31/1996.\n\n\nRemember to replace the column references (C:C, A:A, and B:B) with the actual column numbers where your data is located.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please provide more details.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the three rows that satisfy the selection requirement: item 1 (quantity 5), item 2 (quantity 3) and item 7 (quantity 4)\n2. Confirm total quantity is 5+3+4=12 for customer 3449 on 12/31/1996.",
