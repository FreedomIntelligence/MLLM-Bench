Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n The people in the picture are covering their faces with veils because of a sandstorm, also known as a dust storm. Sandstorms occur when strong winds lift large amounts of sand and dust from a dry, barren land, transporting it over a considerable distance. The individuals are likely using veils to protect themselves from the blowing sand and dust particles, which can cause discomfort and potential health issues if inhaled. Sandstorms can be dangerous, causing reduced visibility, respiratory problems, and damage to property and infrastructure.\n\nSandstorms typically occur in arid or semi-arid regions, such as deserts, where loose sand and dust are abundant. They are often caused by strong winds, usually associated with thunderstorms, low-pressure systems, or strong pressure gradients. The winds can pick up and carry the sand particles, creating a wall of sand and dust that can reduce visibility to near zero, making travel and outdoor activities hazardous.\n\nThe reasons for this weather occurrence can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Dry and barren land: Sandstorms are more likely to occur in areas with sparse vegetation, where there isn't enough plant cover to anchor the soil and prevent it from being easily picked up by the wind.\n\n2. Low humidity: Low humidity levels contribute to the dryness of the soil, making it more susceptible to being carried away by strong winds.\n\n3. Strong winds: High wind speeds are needed to lift and transport sand and dust particles. These winds can be caused by thunderstorms, low-pressure systems, or pressure gradients.\n\n4. Topography: The presence of flat, barren landscapes can facilitate the movement of sand and dust, allowing the wind to carry the particles over long distances.\n\n5. Climate change: Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of sandstorms in some regions.\n\n6. Human activities: Deforestation, overgrazing, and unsustainable land use practices can lead to soil erosion, increasing the likelihood of sandstorms.\n\nIn summary, the people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the blowing sand and dust particles caused by a sandstorm. This weather occurrence is primarily due to strong winds, dry and barren land, low humidity, and specific topographical features in arid or semi-arid regions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
