    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nI would like to fill the vacant space on the far right. Which block should I select? Please describe it's features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe block with a large white star should be selected to fill the vacant space on the far right. The star shape is a distinct feature of the block and can be easily recognized. The block is colored in primary colors, making it stand out on the white background, and it will add an additional element to the puzzle or play area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To fill the vacant space on the far right, you should select the block that is visually distinct from the others and complements the overall design. Here are some features to consider when choosing the right block:\n\n1. Color and Pattern: Choose a block that has a color or pattern that contrasts with the existing blocks. This will help it stand out and draw attention to the empty space.\n\n2. Size and Shape: If the existing blocks are of different sizes and shapes, select a block that either matches or complements the current pattern. This will create a sense of balance and harmony in the design.\n\n3. Texture: If the blocks have a specific texture, choose a block that either matches or contrasts with the existing texture. This will add depth and interest to the design.\n\n4. Theme: If the blocks have a specific theme, select a block that either matches or complements the current theme. This will create a cohesive and unified design.\n\n5. Function: If the blocks have a specific function, select a block that either matches or complements the current function. This will ensure that the design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical and functional.\n\nOnce you have considered these features, select the block that best fits the criteria and place it in the vacant space on the far right. This will complete the design and create a visually appealing and balanced composition.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the block fitting the far right space; reference the yellow block on the far left.",
