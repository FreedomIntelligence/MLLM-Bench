Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExtract the definitions (def) and examples (ex) from the notes, and record the formulas using LaTeX.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\ndef A: A transformation matrix A is an orthogonal matrix, meaning it has a determinant of 1 and its columns and rows are orthonormal.\nex: A transformation matrix is a fundamental tool in linear algebra and geometry, as it can transform points, vectors, and other geometric objects from one coordinate system to another.\n\ndef IFFT: The inverse of a forward Fourier Transform, which converts a time-domain signal back to its frequency components.\nex: IFFT is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, digital image processing, and communication systems.\n\ndef If: An integral transform, which converts a function from the time domain to the frequency domain.\nex: If is essential in transforming periodic signals, such as those encountered in control systems and telecommunication networks.\n\ndef ∫A: The integral of a function A over a specific range.\nex: ∫A is a mathematical operation used in calculus, physics, and engineering to determine the area under the curve of a function.\n\ndef M: A matrix M is an orthogonal matrix, meaning it has a determinant of 1, and its columns and rows are orthonormal.\nex: M is used in linear algebra to represent transformations and transformations matrices.\n\ndef 2: A scalar quantity equal to 2.\nex: 2 is a fundamental number in mathematics and science, often used as a constant or a base for calculating other quantities.\n\ndef 2+I: A complex number, with a real part of 2 and an imaginary part of 1.\nex: 2+I is an important element in complex analysis, which can be used to represent rotations and other transformations in a two-dimensional space.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Definitions:\n\n1. Definition: A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output.\n\nFormula: $f: A \\to B$ is a function if for every element $a \\in A$, there exists a unique element $b \\in B$ such that $(a, b) \\in f$.\n\n2. Definition: A sequence is an ordered list of elements.\n\nFormula: $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence if $a_n$ is an element of a set $A$ for each natural number $n$.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Example: The function $f(x) = x^2$ is a function that maps a real number to its square.\n\n2. Example: The sequence $(a_n) = (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)$ is a sequence of natural numbers.\n\nFormulas in LaTeX:\n\n1. Function: $f: A \\to B, \\forall a \\in A, \\exists! b \\in B: (a, b) \\in f$\n\n2.
