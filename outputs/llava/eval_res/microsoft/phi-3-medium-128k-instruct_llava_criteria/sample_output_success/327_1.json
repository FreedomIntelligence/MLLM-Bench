    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat happens to the images from left to right?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the two images travel from left to right, the image loses contrast, giving it a silhouette appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n When we observe images from left to right, the images appear to move in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is known as the \"motion parallax\" effect.\n\nMotion parallax is a depth cue that arises from the relative motion of objects as an observer moves. When an observer moves from left to right, objects that are closer to them appear to move faster than objects that are farther away. This apparent motion is due to the difference in the time it takes for light from the different objects to reach the observer's eyes.\n\nAs a result, when we observe a scene from left to right, objects that are closer to us appear to move to the right, while objects that are farther away appear to move to the left. This effect is used in various applications, such as in virtual reality and 3D movies, to create a sense of depth and immersion.\n\nIn summary, when we observe images from left to right, the images appear to move in the opposite direction due to the motion parallax effect. This effect helps us perceive depth and distance in a scene.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify changes in exposure, contrast, and color balance between images.\n2. Assess sharpness, noise, and detail preservation in both images.\n3. Evaluate dynamic range, highlighting shadow and highlight detail retention.",
