Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the rightmost person who only shows an arm and a leg holding in his right hand?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The question seems to be a riddle. The answer to this riddle is a person who is holding a \"stop\" sign. The rightmost person who only shows an arm and a leg is holding a stop sign in their right hand. This is because a stop sign is typically held out to the side, showing only one arm and one leg, and the person would hold the sign in their right hand.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe rightmost person who only shows an arm and a leg is holding a cell phone in his right hand.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify object in rightmost person's right hand as a digital device with a display screen.",
