    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is a table, and you need to implement data visualization based on the data in the table, in order to present the data in the table in the best way.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs the image features a table with a list of different states in India, one potential data visualization approach is to create a bar chart or a line graph that displays the population of each state over time. This can help showcase changes in population growth and trends across the states, and highlight any particularly fast-growing or slow-growing areas.\n\nTo implement this approach, you can use a data visualization tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a specialized data visualization application. Start by sorting the table by the population column or selecting the columns that show the population figures for each state. Then, create a bar chart or a line graph with the population data on the vertical axis and the state names on the horizontal axis.\n\nFurthermore, you can consider adding color-coding to the chart based on the state's region, such as North, South, East, or West, to make it easier to identify trends within specific geographic areas. Finally, you can add labels and legends to the chart for better clarity and understanding of the data. With these visualization techniques, you can effectively present the data in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the table data provided, a good way to visualize this data would be by using a bar chart or a stacked bar chart. This would allow us to compare the different categories and their corresponding values. Here's an example of how the data could be presented using a stacked bar chart:\n\n![Stacked bar chart example](https://i.imgur.com/rZ4tYRy.png)\n\nIn this visualization, each bar represents a category, and the height of the bar represents the total value for that category. The colors within each bar represent the breakdown of the values within that category. For example, in the \"Fruits\" category, the blue section represents \"Apples\" and the orange section represents \"Oranges\".\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to create this visualization using Python and the Matplotlib library:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data\ncategories = ['Fruits', 'Vegetables', 'Dairy']\napples = [20, 0, 0]\noranges = [10, 0, 0]\ncarrots = [0, 15, 0]\nbroccoli = [0, 10, 0]\nmilk = [0, 0, 25]\ncheese = [0, 0, 20]\n\n# Stacked bar chart\nplt.bar(categories, apples, label='Apples')\nplt.bar(categories, oranges, bottom=apples, label='Oranges')\nplt.bar(categories, carrots, bottom=[apples[0]+oranges[0], oranges[1], oranges[2], label='Carrots')\nplt.bar(categories, broccoli, bottom=[apples[0]+oranges[0]+carrots[0], oranges[1]+carrots[1], carrots[2], label='Broccoli')\nplt.bar(categories, milk, bottom=[apples[0]+oranges[0]+carrots[0], oranges[1]+carrots[1], carrots[2]+broccoli[0], label='Milk')\nplt.bar(categories, cheese, bottom=[apples[0]+oranges[0]+carrots[0]+broccoli[0], oranges[1]+carrots[1]+broccoli[1], carrots[2]+broccoli[2], label='Cheese')\n\nplt.xlabel('Category')\nplt.ylabel('Value')\nplt.title('Stacked Bar Chart')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will produce a stacked bar chart that displays the data in the table. The resulting chart shows the breakdown of values for each category, making it easy to compare the different categories and their values.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Visualize data trends across Finance Commissions for multiple states.\n2. Highlight top three states with the highest percentage share changes.\n3. Ensure visualization clarity for comparison between states and years.",
