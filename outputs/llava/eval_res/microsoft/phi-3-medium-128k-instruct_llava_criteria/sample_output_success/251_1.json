    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical features of the twins to identify subtle differences that may distinguish them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe twins have similar physical features; however, there are subtle differences that can be observed. First, one twin has a mole on her face close to the left side of her nose, while the other has a slight gap between her eyebrows. Second, the twin on the left has longer hair, as it extends beyond the other girl's hair. These small distinctions in their features make them stand out despite their similar appearances.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n When comparing the physical features of twins, it is essential to look for subtle differences that may distinguish them. Twins, especially identical ones, often share many similarities, but there can be minor differences that set them apart.\n\n1. Facial features: Even though twins may have similar facial structures, there can be slight variations in the shape of their eyes, noses, or mouths. Look for differences in the size and shape of their eyes, the width of their noses, the fullness of their lips, and the contours of their cheeks.\n\n2. Hair: Twins may have different hair textures, colors, or patterns. One twin may have curly hair while the other has straight hair, or one may have a reddish tint while the other has a more blonde or brown hue.\n\n3. Skin: The skin tone of twins can vary slightly, with one twin having a slightly darker or lighter complexion than the other. Additionally, one twin may have more freckles, moles, or birthmarks than the other.\n\n4. Body shape and size: Twins may have different body shapes and sizes, with one twin being slightly taller, heavier, or more muscular than the other. This can be due to differences in diet, exercise, or genetics.\n\n5. Hand and fingerprints: While twins may share similar hand shapes, their fingerprints are unique to each individual. Comparing the patterns and ridges on their fingerprints can help identify subtle differences.\n\n6. Height and build: Twins may have different heights and body builds. One twin may be taller or more slender, while the other may be shorter or more muscular. These differences can be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors.\n\n7. Voice: Twins may have slightly different voices, with variations in pitch, tone, or accent. This can be due to differences in vocal cord structure or the way they learned to speak.\n\n8. Eye color: Some twins may have the same eye color, but others may have subtle differences in the shade or intensity of their eyes.\n\n9. Ear shape and size: Although twins may have similar ear shapes, there can be slight variations in the size and shape of their ears.\n\n10. Body hair: Twins may have different amounts of body hair, with one twin having more or less hair than the other.\n\nWhen comparing the physical features of twins, it is essential to be observant and look for subtle differences that may distinguish them. Keep in mind that these differences may be minor and may not always be apparent at first glance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify facial feature differences such as freckle patterns, eye shape, or smile.\n2. Note hair texture, color variation, or hairstyle distinctions.\n3. Describe any other physical differences, like ear shape or skin tone.",
