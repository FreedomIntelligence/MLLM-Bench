    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the color, shape and other attribute you think would be useful for people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The object I have in mind is a red apple. It is generally round in shape, with a smooth, shiny skin that reflects light and gives it a glossy appearance. The color is a vibrant red, with some variations in hue and shade that can range from deep crimson to a lighter, more translucent red. Its shape is a perfect sphere, slightly flattened at the top and bottom where it was attached to the tree. The surface is covered with small, slightly dimpled textures that are the remnants of the blossom end and the stem. \n\nApart from its shape and color, other attributes that could help people recognize it include:\n\n1. Stem: A small, brown, woody protrusion at the top, which is the point of attachment to the tree.\n\n2. Dimples: The dimpled texture of the skin, which is a result of the apple's growth process.\n\n3. Thickness: The apple has a medium-thickness skin that is firm to the touch.\n\n4. Size: The size of a typical apple ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 inches in diameter.\n\n5. Weight: A medium-sized apple typically weighs around 150-200 grams.\n\n6. Smell: A fresh apple has a sweet, fruity aroma that is characteristic of its variety.\n\n7. Texture: The skin is smooth and slightly waxy when touched.\n\n8. Core: Inside the apple, there is a white or cream-colored, star-shaped core with several small, black seeds in the center.\n\n9. Flesh: The flesh is juicy and crisp, with a white or cream color, depending on the variety.\n\n10. Taste: The taste of a fresh apple is sweet, tart, or a combination of both, depending on the variety.\n\nThese attributes can help people recognize a red apple among other fruits and objects.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a beautiful, multicolored plant with vibrant green and yellow leaves. The plant exhibits an interesting and colorful flower pattern, making it a striking and attractive feature in the garden. The plant's bright leaves and blooms create an eye-catching and lively effect, adding a unique touch of natural beauty to the garden.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the plant as Hosta.\n 2. Describe the shape, color, and arrangement of the plant's leaves.\n3. Mention any additional attributes that aid recognition (e.g., environment, leaf pattern).",
