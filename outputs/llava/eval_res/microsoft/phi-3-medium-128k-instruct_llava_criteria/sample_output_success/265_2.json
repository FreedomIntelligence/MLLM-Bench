    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n There could be several circumstances that could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Health Emergency:** The person could have experienced a sudden health issue such as a fainting spell, a seizure, or a heart attack, which caused them to collapse. The papers might be their work materials that they were carrying when the incident occurred.\n\n2. **Accident:** They might have tripped or slipped, perhaps due to a loose carpet or an obstacle in the corridor, causing them to fall. The papers could be from their briefcase or folder that opened upon impact.\n\n3. **Intentional Act:** The individual could be protesting or making a statement, lying on the floor as a form of demonstration or performance art.\n\n4. **Work-related incident:** They could be a researcher or student who was working on a project and inadvertently fell while carrying a pile of papers, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.\n\n5. **Deliberate action:** They might have intentionally laid down the papers and themselves as part of a planned activity, perhaps as a flash mob or to draw attention to a cause.\n\n6. **Theft or Loss:** The person could have been robbed or lost their belongings and fell in the process of trying to collect their papers.\n\n7. **Mental Health Crisis:** The individual might be experiencing a mental health crisis, which led to a disoriented state and subsequent collapse. The papers might be personal or work-related documents they were carrying.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
