    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the current motion of the vehicles, we can predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. Let's assume Vehicle A is moving at a constant speed of 10 m/s, and Vehicle B is moving at a constant speed of 15 m/s. Also, let's assume the vehicles are initially 50 meters apart, and they are heading towards each other on a straight road.\n\nTrajectory prediction for the next few seconds:\n\n1. After 1 second:\n   - Vehicle A will have traveled 10 meters (10 m/s * 1 s).\n   - Vehicle B will have traveled 15 meters (15 m/s * 1 s).\n   - The distance between the two vehicles will be 25 meters (50 - 10 - 15).\n\n2. After 2 seconds:\n   - Vehicle A will have traveled 20 meters (10 m/s * 2 s).\n   - Vehicle B will have traveled 30 meters (15 m/s * 2 s).\n   - The distance between the two vehicles will be 0 meters (50 - 20 - 30).\n\nTo avoid a collision, drivers can take the following actions:\n\n1. Vehicle A:\n   - Slow down: Reduce speed to allow more time for reaction and avoid a collision.\n   - Change lanes: If there is another lane in the same direction, change lanes to avoid the oncoming vehicle.\n   - Apply brakes: If the collision is imminent, apply brakes to reduce the impact force.\n\n2. Vehicle B:\n   - Slow down: Reduce speed to allow more time for reaction and avoid a collision.\n   - Change lanes: If there is another lane in the same direction, change lanes to avoid the oncoming vehicle.\n   - Apply brakes: If the collision is imminent, apply brakes to reduce the impact force.\n\nIn summary, both drivers should try to slow down, change lanes if possible, or apply brakes to avoid a collision. It is essential to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and stay alert to potential hazards on the road.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
