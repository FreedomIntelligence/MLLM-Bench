    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the provided image, it appears to be a superficial wound located on the forearm. The wound is linear and approximately 2-3 centimeters in length. It has clean edges, suggesting that it might have been caused by a sharp object, such as a knife or a piece of glass. The surrounding skin is reddened, indicating some inflammation and possible mild irritation.\n\nAs for advice, here are some steps to take for proper wound care:\n\n1. Clean the wound: Gently rinse the wound with clean, running water to remove any debris or dirt. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, as these can damage tissue and slow healing.\n\n2. Apply an antibiotic ointment: This will help to prevent infection and promote healing.\n\n3. Cover the wound: Use an adhesive bandage or sterile gauze and medical tape to protect the wound from bacteria and further injury.\n\n4. Change the dressing regularly: Change the dressing at least once a day or whenever it becomes wet or dirty.\n\n5. Monitor for signs of infection: Keep an eye out for increased redness, swelling, or pus, as these are signs of infection.\n\n6. Keep the wound dry: Avoid submerging the wound in water, and pat it dry gently after cleaning.\n\nIf the wound is deep, won't stop bleeding, or shows signs of infection, seek medical attention.\n\nRemember to get a tetanus shot if you haven't had one in the last 5-10 years, as puncture wounds can be at risk for tetanus. Also, if the wound was caused by an animal bite or a dirty object, consult a healthcare professional for further advice.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
