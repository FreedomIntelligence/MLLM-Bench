    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the function of the design of the tread in the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The tread on the picture appears to be from a tire, which is a critical component of a vehicle's wheel. The primary function of the tire tread is to provide traction and grip on various surfaces, particularly on roads. The pattern and depth of the tread are crucial for maintaining contact with the road surface, which in turn ensures stability, handling, and safety. The tread design incorporates grooves and channels that help to channel water away from the tire's contact patch to reduce the risk of hydroplaning on wet surfaces. Additionally, the tread pattern can influence noise levels, rolling resistance, and overall tire performance. The design often includes different shapes and sizes of blocks and sipes (small slits in the tread blocks) to optimize the tire's grip in different driving conditions, such as dry, wet, or snowy conditions. The tread also contributes to the tire's wear characteristics, affecting the tire's lifespan and performance over time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe design of the tread on the sole of the shoe in the image serves a specific purpose related to the footwear's function. The criss-cross pattern of the tread provides an enhanced grip and traction to the wearer while walking or running on various surfaces. This tread design helps prevent slipping and keeps the wearer's feet secured on the ground, reducing the risk of falls and injuries. Additionally, the tread contributes to the overall durability and longevity of the shoe, as the pattern helps to distribute the wear evenly and absorbs shock from each step taken.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify tread pattern and describe its function for traction and stability.\n2. Mention material properties contributing to grip and durability.\n3. Explain tread design relevance to specific activities or conditions.",
