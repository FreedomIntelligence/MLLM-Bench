    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, classify the event taking place and determine the subject of the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe event taking place is a parade, with the subject being a giant inflatable Spider-Man balloon. The balloon is placed on a float, and it appears to be the main attraction of the parade. The crowd of people is gathered around the street to witness this spectacle, making the event lively and enjoyable. Parades often feature unique and eye-catching floats, and this Spider-Man balloon certainly seems to be the center of attention in this particular event.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the description of the image, it is not possible for me to classify the event or determine the subject of the event as I am unable to view images. If you could provide a detailed description of the image, I would be more than happy to help you classify the event and determine its subject.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the event as a parade, noting the large character balloon and crowd.\n2. Recognize the subject as a character from popular culture.\n3. Describe the atmosphere indicative of a celebratory event.",
