    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nConsidering her attire and appearance, could you discern the profession or occupation of the individual in the picture?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the individual is dressed as a firefighter, wearing a fire helmet, a yellow and red uniform, and carrying a toy fire hose. The profession or occupation of the person in the picture is most likely a firefighter, as their attire, appearance, and the toy equipment they are carrying are indicative of their role in the field.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Without the actual picture, it's impossible to make an accurate assessment. However, generally speaking, people's attire and appearance can sometimes give clues about their profession or occupation. For example, if the person is wearing a white lab coat with a stethoscope, it could suggest they are a medical professional. If they're dressed in a business suit, they might be in a corporate environment. A person in a uniform with a badge might be a police officer or a security guard. If they're wearing protective gear, they might be in a construction or industrial job. But it's important to remember that appearances can be deceiving, and it's not always possible to determine someone's profession based on their attire alone.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer should infer that the individual is a kid, based on the reference provided.\n2. Answer should infer that the kid is roleplaying a firefighter.",
