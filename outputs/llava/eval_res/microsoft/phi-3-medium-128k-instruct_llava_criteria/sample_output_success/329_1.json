    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAssess the quality of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image is blurred, making it difficult to discern fine details. The main focus of the image is a cell phone, which is being held in a person's hand and partially overlapping with their palm. The background appears to be a grassy area, but the details are not clearly visible due to the blurry nature of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n As an AI, I'm unable to view images directly. However, I can provide guidance on how to assess the quality of an image.\n\nWhen evaluating the quality of an image, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Resolution: Check the image's resolution, which is measured in pixels (width x height). Higher resolution images have more detail and appear clearer when zoomed in.\n\n2. Compression artifacts: Look for any signs of compression artifacts, such as pixelation, blockiness, or blurriness. These are often present in low-quality images or those that have been overly compressed.\n\n3. Sharpness: A sharp image has clear edges and fine details. Blurry images may have been taken with a slow shutter speed, a low-quality lens, or may have been accidentally blurred during post-processing.\n\n4. Color accuracy: Evaluate if the colors in the image are accurate and vibrant, or if they appear washed out, oversaturated, or distorted.\n\n5. Noise: Examine the image for noise, which appears as random speckles or grain. High noise levels can be caused by low light conditions or a high ISO setting.\n\n6. Contrast and brightness: Check if the image has balanced contrast and brightness, or if it appears too dark or too bright.\n\n7. Focus: Determine if the main subject of the image is in focus, or if it appears blurry or out of focus.\n\n8. Artistic merit: Consider the composition, lighting, and overall aesthetic appeal of the image.\n\n9. File format: The file format (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.) may also impact the quality of the image, as some formats are better suited for specific purposes (e.g., JPEG for web use, TIFF for archiving).\n\nBy considering these factors, you can assess the quality of an image and determine if it meets your needs.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the VLM identifies the low pixel quality of the image.\n2. Evaluate sharpness and clarity of the image content.\n3. Assess the visibility and legibility of the text \"Love Playing Snake?\".",
