    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the visual cues in the image, what will be the possible action of the driver?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n Based on the visual cues in the image, it appears that the driver is approaching a traffic light that is currently showing a yellow signal. The possible action of the driver could be to slow down and prepare to stop if it is safe to do so. If the driver is too close to the intersection and it's unsafe to stop, they might decide to proceed with caution.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nLooking at the visual cues, the driver is likely to follow the directions displayed on the phone, possibly to find a specific destination or to reach a nearby place. The driver is holding the cell phone in the car, and it is connected to a dash mount, which suggests that they will be using the phone's navigation system for guidance. The driver is responsible for safely maintaining their attention on the road while relying on this system to navigate the city.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes \"slow down till stop\" or \"turn left to adjacent lane\" based on visual cues.\n2. Response must consider traffic conditions and road layout visible in the image.\n3. Answer must be logically consistent with the driver's possible actions in the given context.",
