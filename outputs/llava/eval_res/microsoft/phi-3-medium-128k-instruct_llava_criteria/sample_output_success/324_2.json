    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat makes the image blurry?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n An image can become blurry due to several reasons, including:\n\n1. Camera shake: If the camera or object moves during the exposure, the resulting image can be blurry. This is especially noticeable when using slow shutter speeds.\n2. Poor focus: If the camera doesn't focus properly on the subject, the resulting image will be blurry.\n3. Low resolution: Images with low resolution can appear blurry when viewed at larger sizes or when zoomed in.\n4. Motion blur: If the subject is moving during the exposure, the resulting image will have motion blur.\n5. Optical aberrations: Imperfections in the camera lens can cause blur in the final image.\n6. Compression artifacts: When images are compressed using lossy compression algorithms (e.g., JPEG), artifacts can appear, making the image look blurry or distorted.\n7. Depth of field: If the depth of field is shallow and the subject is not within the focused area, the image will appear blurry.\n8. Atmospheric conditions: Poor lighting conditions, fog, or other atmospheric factors can make an image appear blurry.\n\nTo reduce blurriness in images, you can try the following techniques:\n\n1. Use a tripod or stabilize your camera to minimize camera shake.\n2. Focus on the subject properly and use autofocus if necessary.\n3. Increase the resolution of your images by using a higher-quality camera or lens.\n4. Use a faster shutter speed to freeze motion and reduce motion blur.\n5. Use lenses with fewer optical aberrations or correct for them using software.\n6. Save images using lossless compression formats (e.g., PNG) to avoid compression artifacts.\n7. Adjust the aperture to increase the depth of field and keep more of the scene in focus.\n8. Improve lighting conditions or wait for better weather to reduce atmospheric blur.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image is blurry because it was taken on a moving train, such as a subway train or a train passing down the tracks. The motion creates a sense of blurriness or visual uncertainty, as the train and its surroundings were not stationary during capture.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the blur is due to low pixel count.\n2. Assess whether motion contributes to the image's blurriness.\n3. Evaluate if focus issues are causing the blur in the image.",
