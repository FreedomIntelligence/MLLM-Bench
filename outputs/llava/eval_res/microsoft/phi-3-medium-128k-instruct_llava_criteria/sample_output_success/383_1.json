    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, predict the skater boy's next move and assess the risk of the action.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe skater boy is in mid-air, jumping over a skate ramp and grabbing his skateboard while executing the trick. Based on this action, it can be inferred that he is likely to land the trick with a challenging and visually impressive maneuver, possibly involving his skateboard flipping or spinning.\n\nThe risk of the action in this scenario is relatively high, as the skater boy is not on the ground and is performing a complex trick that requires control and precision. Making a mistake while trying to land the trick could result in a fall, possibly causing injuries. To mitigate these risks, skateboarders often wear protective gear such as helmets, knee pads, and wrist guards to ensure their safety during such stunts. Skill, experience, and practice also play a crucial role in reducing the risk and improving the execution of challenging tricks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the image provided, it appears that the skater boy is currently in motion, likely performing a trick or maneuver on his skateboard. Without further context, it's difficult to predict his exact next move. However, some common moves a skater boy might attempt include an ollie, kickflip, heelflip, or a grind on a rail or ledge.\n\nAssessing the risk of the action depends on various factors such as the skater's skill level, the environment, and the specific move being performed. Generally, skateboarding tricks carry a certain level of risk due to the potential for falls, collisions, and injuries. For example, if the skater boy is attempting a complex trick, the risk of injury may be higher.\n\nIn the image, it's essential to observe the skater's body position, balance, and the surrounding environment. If the skater boy appears to be in control and the environment is free of hazards, the risk may be relatively low. However, if the skater boy is in an unfamiliar or challenging location, or if he's attempting a particularly difficult trick, the risk of injury could be higher.\n\nUltimately, the risk of the skater boy's next move depends on his skill level, the complexity of the trick, and the environment in which he's skating. It's always essential to practice safety measures, such as wearing appropriate protective gear and being aware of one's surroundings, to minimize the risk of injury.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predict the skater's next move based on current posture and position.\n2. Assess the risk involved in the predicted next move.\n3. Ensure the answer aligns with the skater's current momentum and skatepark layout.",
