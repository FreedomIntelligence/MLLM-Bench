    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to view images directly. However, I can guide you on how to find differences between two pictures. Here's a step-by-step process you can follow:\n\n1. **Take a first glance:** Look at both images quickly to get a general idea of what they contain.\n\n2. **Focus on details:** Pay close attention to the details in each picture. Look for differences in color, shape, size, position, and any other noticeable features.\n\n3. **Start with the background:** Compare the backgrounds of both images first. Look for differences in the landscape, buildings, or any other background elements.\n\n4. **Check foreground objects:** Now, focus on the objects in the foreground. Compare the objects' positions, sizes, colors, and any other distinguishing features.\n\n5. **Look for text or numbers:** If there's any text or numbers in the images, compare them carefully.\n\n6. **Check for any hidden differences:** Sometimes, differences may be hidden in small details like shadows, reflections, or patterns.\n\n7. **Count the differences:** As you identify each difference, keep a count. When you reach five differences, stop looking for more.\n\nHere's a sample list of differences you might find in two pictures:\n\n1. The color of a car in the left-hand image is blue, while in the right-hand image, it's red.\n2. There are three birds in the left-hand image, but only two in the right-hand image.\n3. The left-hand image has a tree with a swing hanging from it, while the right-hand image does not.\n4. The background of the left-hand image is brightly lit, while the right-hand image has a shadowy background.\n5. The right-hand image has a street sign that says \"Park,\" while the left-hand image does not have a street sign.\n\nRemember, these are just examples, and the actual differences will depend on the specific images you're comparing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere are two images of a penguin sitting in the snow. The first image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and catching a fish, while the second image shows the penguin holding a fishing pole and preparing to catch a fish. There are many fish in both pictures, but their positions are different. On the left, the fish are near the top-right side, and on the right, the fish are closer to the penguin. The penguin appears to be the same in both images, with no noticeable differences in its appearance. Overall, there are five differences in the image pairs, including the fish's positions, the fishing pole's orientation, and the fish's visibility.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences in penguin's left foot color, ice hole size, background iceberg, fishing line buoys, and penguin tail.",
