    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the foods on the table detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe table features a plate full of food, which includes meat, bread, greens, and a salad. There are several pieces of bread, some of which are of different sizes. A bowl of sauce is also present on the table. Additionally, there's a donut on the table, slightly separated from the main plate of food.\n\nIn the background, a stuffed teddy bear is sitting next to the plate. The dining table occupies most of the scene, setting a casual atmosphere for enjoying the meal.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Upon observing the table, one can see a variety of dishes, each with its own unique colors, textures, and aromas. At the center of the table is a large, beautifully roasted turkey, its golden-brown skin glistening under the soft light. The turkey has been carved into neat slices, revealing the tender, juicy meat beneath.\n\nTo the left of the turkey, there is a colorful assortment of vegetables. There are vibrant green beans, steamed to perfection, with a slight snap when bitten into. Nearby, there are bright orange carrots, roasted until they are tender and slightly caramelized. A bowl of fluffy, white mashed potatoes sits next to the carrots, with tiny flecks of butter and a hint of garlic.\n\nOn the right side of the turkey, there are several side dishes. A creamy green pea soup with a swirl of cream on top is accompanied by a crusty bread roll. A warm, savory stuffing made with diced apples, sage, and onions is placed next to the soup, and a dish of roasted Brussels sprouts, their leaves crispy and caramelized, is next to the stuffing.\n\nThe table is also adorned with an array of sauces and condiments. A tangy cranberry sauce with its deep red color and small seeds peeking through is placed on one corner of the table. A bowl of gravy, thick and brown, is positioned next to the turkey. A small dish of butter, soft and golden, is also present, along with a bottle of olive oil and a jar of dijon mustard.\n\nLastly, the table is finished with a selection of desserts. There is a rich, chocolate cake with a velvety frosting, a light and airy lemon tart with a tangy glaze, and a platter of freshly baked cookies, warm and fragrant.\n\nThe table is a feast for the senses, with a variety of textures, colors, and flavors that come together to create a memorable dining experience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe all visible food items, including chicken wings and chili powder.\n2. Mention textures or colors where relevant to the description of the foods.",
