    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nOne glass falls on the wooden floor in the figure, and another identical glass falls in the area interspersed with beige and white in the figure, both from a height of half a meter from the floor. Please analyze which one is more likely to break.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To analyze which glass is more likely to break, we need to consider several factors that could affect the outcome:\n\n1. Material of the floor: The wooden floor is likely to be more forgiving than the area interspersed with beige and white, which could be concrete or tile. These harder surfaces will cause more force upon impact, increasing the likelihood of the glass breaking.\n\n2. Floor texture: The wooden floor may have a smoother texture compared to the area with beige and white, which could have a rougher surface. A rougher surface can cause more damage to the glass upon impact.\n\n3. Angle of impact: If the glasses fall at different angles, the force of impact will differ. A more direct impact (90-degree angle) will cause more damage than a glancing blow (less than 90-degree angle).\n\n4. Glass quality: If the glasses are not identical, the quality of the glass could affect the likelihood of breaking. One glass may have a thicker or stronger construction than the other.\n\nGiven these factors, it is more likely that the glass falling on the area interspersed with beige and white (assuming it's a harder surface like concrete or tile) will break due to the increased force of impact and the potential roughness of the surface. However, it's essential to note that the actual outcome can still vary depending on the specific conditions and variables involved.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the given image, we have two identical glasses, one falling on a wooden floor and another on a beige and white checkered floor. The wooden floor, being a solid and stiff material, is more likely to cause the glass to break upon impact due to its hard nature. In contrast, the beige and white checkered floor is more flexible and may provide some cushioning, which increases the likelihood that the glass falling on this surface would be less likely to break upon impact.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention the first glass is more likely to break.\n2. Analyze surface hardness and potential cushioning for both landing areas.\n3. Determine which glass is more likely to break based on physical reasoning.",
