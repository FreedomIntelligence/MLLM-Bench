    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the object in the bottom leftmost corner with the object in the top rightmost corner, and use a table to show their advantages and disadvantages considering their design, material, functionalities, etc.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the bottom leftmost corner is a pink pair of headphones, while the object in the top right corner is a white pair of headphones. The pink headphones are possibly designed for aesthetic purposes, while the white ones are more likely designed for a minimalist and sleek appearance. In terms of functionality, both headphones and headphones appear to provide similar features, such as stereo sound, but the white headphones could potentially offer better audio quality due to their sleek design and possibly improved materials.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* The pink headphones, likely designed for aesthetic purposes, could appeal to a wide range of users, especially those who prefer a colorful appearance.\n* Similarly, the white headphones' sleek design may appeal to users who prefer minimalistic and modern styles.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* The pink headphones, while visually appealing, might not offer the same level of durability or performance as the white headphones due to materials used in their construction.\n* The white headphones' sleek design could make them more prone to wear and damage, requiring extra caution in handling and usage.\n\nConsidering these factors, the choice between the pink and white headphones ultimately depends on the user's personal preferences, style, and requirements in terms of functionality and durability.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To compare an object in the bottom leftmost corner with an object in the top rightmost corner, I'll use two hypothetical objects: a bottom leftmost desktop computer and a top rightmost smartphone.
