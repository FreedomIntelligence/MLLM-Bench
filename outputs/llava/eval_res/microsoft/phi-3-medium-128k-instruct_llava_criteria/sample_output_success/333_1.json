    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To evaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check for obvious physical damage: Look for cracks, dents, or broken parts on the phone's exterior. If the phone has any visible damage, it may affect its functionality.\n\n2. Check the screen: If the screen is cracked or damaged, it may be difficult to use the phone. A cracked screen can cause display issues, touch sensitivity problems, or even complete display failure.\n\n3. Try turning on the phone: If the phone does not turn on, it may indicate a hardware issue, such as a damaged battery or motherboard.\n\n4. Check for water damage: If the phone has been exposed to water, it may have internal damage that can affect its functionality. Look for signs of water damage, such as corrosion or discoloration on the phone's ports or components.\n\n5. Check for software issues: If the phone turns on, but the software is not functioning properly, it may be a software issue rather than a hardware issue. Try resetting the phone or updating the software to see if that resolves the problem.\n\n6. Test the phone's functionality: Check if the phone can make calls, send texts, and access the internet. If the phone cannot perform these basic functions, it may need repair.\n\n7. Check for sound and microphone issues: Try making a call or recording a voice memo to see if the microphone and speakers are working properly.\n\n8. Check the camera: If the camera is not working, it may be a hardware issue, but it could also be a software issue that can be resolved with an update or reset.\n\n9. Check for charging issues: If the phone is not charging or charging slowly, it may be a battery or charging port issue.\n\n10. Check for connectivity issues: If the phone cannot connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices, it may be a hardware issue, but it could also be a software issue that can be resolved with an update or reset.\n\nIf the phone is experiencing any of these issues, it may need repair. However, if the phone is still functioning properly and the issues are minor, it may be usable without repair. However, it's always a good idea to have a professional assess the damage to determine if repair is necessary.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
