    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the decoration style in the image, what items in the picture reflect this style?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe decoration style in the image appears to be modern and contemporary. This is reflected in the use of white and brown tones, as well as the clean and sleek design. The bedroom features a white bed, a wall adorned with modern art, and brown wooden headboard, which contribute to the overall contemporary atmosphere. Additionally, the presence of a wall sconce provides a touch of modern elegance. Overall, these elements work together to create an inviting and stylish bedroom environment.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Without an image to analyze, I can provide a general description of a few popular decoration styles and the items that typically reflect them.\n\n1. Minimalist Style: This style emphasizes simplicity and the use of basic geometric shapes. Items that reflect this style include:\n   - Clean lines and simple shapes in furniture, such as a sleek sofa or a minimalist coffee table.\n   - Neutral color palette, including white, gray, and black.\n   - Minimal accessories, such as a single pendant light or a small sculpture.\n   - Functional and uncluttered spaces.\n\n2.
