    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To explain the humor in an image, one must analyze the visual and contextual elements that play a role in creating the comedic effect. However, since there is no actual image provided in your request, I'll walk you through a hypothetical example.\n\nLet's assume the image is a cartoon of a cat sitting at a computer with a confused expression, surrounded by a chaotic mess of papers and coffee cups.\n\n1. **Character and Setting**: The cat, a common subject for humor due to its anthropomorphic portrayal, is shown in a human environment, specifically at a desk with a computer. This juxtaposition is amusing because it places a non-human character in a typically human context.\n\n2. **Action**: The cat appears to be working at the computer, which is funny because it's an unexpected and absurd behavior for a feline.\n\n3. **Surrounding Chaos**: The disarray of papers and coffee cups suggests the cat is either a messy worker or has had an accident, both of which are humorous exaggerations of human work habits.\n\n4. **Facial Expression**: The cat's confused expression adds to the humor as it contrasts with the chaotic environment, implying that the cat is bewildered by the mess it has created or is overwhelmed by the task at hand.\n\n5. **Caption or Dialogue**: If the image includes a caption or dialogue, it might add a punchline or further context that increases the humor. For example, a caption reading \"Attempting to multitask: work and make a latte\" would enhance the comedic effect by playing on the absurdity of the situation.\n\nBy combining these elements, the image elicits laughter through surprise, absurdity, and relatability, as many people can empathize with the chaos of a messy workspace.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
