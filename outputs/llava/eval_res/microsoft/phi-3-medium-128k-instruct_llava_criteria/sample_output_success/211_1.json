Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhich parts of the map have the greatest humidity?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the map, the areas with the highest humidity levels are located around the eastern part of China.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To determine the parts of a map with the greatest humidity, you would typically look for regions that are near large bodies of water, at lower altitudes, or in tropical areas, as these factors generally contribute to higher humidity levels. However, without a specific map to reference, I cannot provide exact locations. If you have a particular map in mind, please provide more details or the context of the map, and I can offer a more precise answer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the area with the darkest shade representing the highest humidity range.\n2. Reference the legend to confirm the highest humidity value.\n3. Describe the geographic location of the area with the greatest humidity.",
