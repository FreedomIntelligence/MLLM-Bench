    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image is of dimension 675*900, assume the bottom left corner to be the origin of coordinates (0,0), the coordinates of the top left corner to be (0,900) and the coordinates of the bottom right corner to be (675,0), where approximately would you place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\"?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo place the coordinates of the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in the image, we can consider the middle-left portion of the image, which is approximately at 0.15, 0.23. This placement would make the sign visible and accessible to the customers. The coordinates for this placement would be (0.25, 0.16, 0.45, 0.36), with the sign being slightly to the left of the center of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n To place the sign indicating \"Lemons 6 for $3\" in a visually appealing and understandable location, you can consider placing it near the center of the image. Since the image has dimensions 675x900, you can calculate the center coordinates as follows:\n\nCenter X coordinate = (Width / 2) = (675 / 2) = 337.5\nCenter Y coordinate = (Height / 2) = (900 / 2) = 450\n\nSo, the approximate coordinates for placing the sign would be (337.5, 450). However, depending on the context and design of the image, you may want to adjust the position slightly. For example, if the lemons are displayed at the bottom of the image, you might want to place the sign slightly above the lemons to draw attention to the offer.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Coordinates should approximate (450,600) for the \"Lemons 6 for $3\" sign.",
