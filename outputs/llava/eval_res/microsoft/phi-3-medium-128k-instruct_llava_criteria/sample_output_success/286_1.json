    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEngage in speculation regarding the age group to which the black girl in white in the picture likely belongs, considering the context of the event depicted\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image depicts a group of people, including a black girl in a white shirt, gathered around tables at an event. Since this event appears to be a school function, it is plausible that the black girl in white might belong to a younger age group, such as elementary or middle school students. The presence of multiple people participating in the event, as well as the presence of tables and chairs, further supports the notion that this is a school-related event.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the context of the event depicted in the picture, we can make a few assumptions about the age group of the black girl in white. If the event is a graduation ceremony, she might be in her late teens or early twenties, as this is the typical age range for high school or college graduation. If the event is a wedding, she could be anywhere from a young child to a middle-aged woman, depending on the context and her role in the ceremony. Without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact age, but we can make some educated guesses based on the clothing and setting.\n\nIf the black girl in white is wearing a cap and gown, it is likely she is attending a graduation ceremony, and her age would be between 17 and 22 years old. This is because most high schools and colleges hold graduation ceremonies for students who have completed their studies, which usually takes place when students are in their late teens or early twenties. If the event is a wedding, the age range could be broader, depending on her role in the ceremony. If she is the bride, she could be in her late teens to late twenties, as this is the typical age range for first-time brides. If she is a guest or a relative, she could be any age, but it is more common for guests to be family members of the bride or groom who are in their thirties or older.\n\nIf the event is a religious ceremony, such as a baptism or confirmation, the girl could be a child or a teenager, as these ceremonies are usually performed when children are young or in their early teens.\n\nOf course, these are all assumptions, and without more information, it is impossible to determine the girl's exact age. However, by considering the context of the event and her role in it, we can make some educated guesses about her age group.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer includes speculation on girl's age group: elementary or middle school.",
