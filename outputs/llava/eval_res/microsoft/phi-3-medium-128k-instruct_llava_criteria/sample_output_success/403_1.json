    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that not only describes what is seen but also evokes the other senses, such as the smell of the fresh peaches or the taste of the jam, to create a multi-sensory experience.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a large woven basket filled with a variety of ripe peaches, placed beside a wooden table. Their colors range from vibrant reds to deep oranges, and they appear to be fresh and juicy. The basket, which seems to be handmade, lends a rustic charm to the scene. Next to the basket, there is a white ceramic jar filled with a sweet, homemade jam. The aroma of the peaches entices the senses, while the taste of the jam offers a delightful contrast to the freshness of the fruit. The combination of these elements creates a delightful and nostalgia-inducing experience that captures the essence of a sunny summer day spent outdoors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n \"Savor the sweet aroma of ripe, sun-kissed peaches, their juicy flesh bursting with flavor, transformed into a luscious, homemade jam that tantalizes your taste buds with every spoonful.\"\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes visual description of peaches, jam jar, and setting.\n2. Caption evokes sense of smell (e.g., fresh peaches) and taste (e.g., sweet jam).\n3. Caption is coherent, creates a multi-sensory experience, and aligns with the image.",
