    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDeduce the possible techniques the standing man going to use based on the current stance and gesture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nGiven the current stance and gesture of the standing man holding another man in a chair above his head, it is unlikely that the standing man is going to use any techniques involving physical contact or direct interaction with the man being held. Instead, it seems more likely that the standing man is using his upper body strength and balance to pose the man in the chair above his head, showcasing his ability or demonstrating a particular skill. This could be part of a performance or an exhibition of athleticism, rather than participating in a sports event or combat scenario.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n Based on the current stance and gesture, the standing man may be preparing to perform a few possible actions. Some of these actions might include:\n\n1. Greeting or waving: The man's hand is raised, which could indicate he is about to wave at someone or give a friendly greeting.\n\n2. Pointing: The man might be pointing at something or someone nearby.\n\n3. Signaling: He may be about to use his hand to signal or indicate something specific.\n\n4. Gesturing: The man's hand gesture could be part of a larger non-verbal communication, such as indicating a direction, showing a number, or expressing an emotion.\n\n\n4. Ballroom dancing: If the man is in a dance setting, such as a ballroom, the raised hand could be a part of a specific dance move.\n\n5. The raised hand could be part of a larger sequence of movements, such as in a performance or a choreographed routine.\n\n6. Preparing for a handshake: The raised hand could be a signal to initiate a handshake with another person.\n\n7. Demonstrating: The man might be demonstrating or teaching a dance move or a specific action in a performance or a sport.\n\n8. Sign language: If the man is using sign language, the raised hand could be part of a sign or a sign language expression.\n\nIt is essential to consider the context and the man's body language to make a more accurate deduction.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the current physical stance and gesture of the man standing.\n2. Predict the next likely wrestling move or technique based on stance and gesture.\n3. Ensure the prediction is plausible within the context of wrestling.",
