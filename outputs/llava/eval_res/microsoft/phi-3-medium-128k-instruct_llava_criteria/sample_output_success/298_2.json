    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the size and shape of the center island and the items suspended above it, deduce if this kitchen island can be served as a dining area.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n To determine if the kitchen island can be used as a dining area, we need to consider several factors such as the size and shape of the center island, the items suspended above it, and the available space around it. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. Size and shape of the center island: The island should be large enough to accommodate a dining table and chairs. Ideally, the island should have a length of at least 48 inches (120 cm) and a width of at least 24 inches (60 cm) to provide enough space for seating. A rectangular or square shape is more suitable for a dining area compared to a round one.\n\n2. Clearance space: There should be enough clearance space around the island for people to move around comfortably. A minimum of 36 inches (90 cm) is recommended between the island and other furniture or walls.\n\n3. Height of the island: The height of the island should be at least 30 inches (75 cm) to provide enough legroom for seated individuals.\n\n4. Items suspended above the island: The items suspended above the island, such as lighting fixtures or hanging cabinets, should not obstruct the view or interfere with the dining experience.\n\n5. Surface area: The surface area of the island should be large enough to accommodate a dining table of at least 36 inches (90 cm) in diameter.\n\n6. Countertop material: The countertop material should be durable and easy to clean, as it will be used for both food preparation and dining.\n\n7. Overhead clearance: There should be enough overhead clearance (at least 84 inches or 213 cm) to accommodate a dining table and chairs without causing any inconvenience.\n\nIf the center island meets these criteria, it can be served as a dining area. However, it is essential to consider the overall kitchen layout and the available space around the island. If the kitchen is too small or the island is obstructing the flow of traffic, it might not be suitable as a dining area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the kitchen has a large center island that appears spacious and has a sink positioned towards the right side. Moreover, various items such as pots, pans, and a bowl are hanging above the island. However, the presence of hanging items, pots, and pans over the island instead of a traditional dining table suggests that the kitchen island might not serve as a dining area. Instead, it primarily functions as a workspace for food preparation and cooking.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the island's size and shape accommodate dining functions.\n2. Evaluate the practicality of suspended items for a dining area.\n3. Determine if the island's height is suitable for seated dining.",
