Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the activity taking place and briefly introduce the game rule.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n The activity taking place involves players engaging in a board game called \"Monopoly.\" The game rule is simple: each player starts with a set amount of money and takes turns rolling two dice to move around the board, buying properties, building houses and hotels, and collecting rent from other players. The goal is to bankrupt your opponents and strategically, while managing your finances and properties.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of people, including both children and adults, are playing a game together. They are holding hands and are in a circle while one person stands in the center, possibly trying to break the circle. The name of the game is \"Hot Potato\" or an Indian version of it. The objective of the game is for the person standing in the center to pass the ball or potato to another person without letting it touch the ground, essentially becoming the \"hot\" potato. This game is played for fun, as it tests the players' reflexes, agility, and social camaraderie.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the activity depicted and determine if it aligns with a known children's game.\n2. Explain the basic rule(s) of the game based on the visual cues in the image.",
