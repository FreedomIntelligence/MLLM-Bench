    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the two images closely to identify and compare the differences between them as many as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe two images show a brown and black dog in different poses and settings. The first image features the dog carrying a bottle in its mouth, with one paw on a bowl and the other paw on a cat. The dog appears to be placing the bottle into the bowl. The second image displays the dog with a bone in its mouth, standing next to a house.\n\nIn the first image, the dog is positioned more towards the left side, while in the second image, it is positioned more towards the right side. Although both images show the dog in action, there are some noticeable differences in the objects the dog is carrying and its surroundings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are some differences between the two images:\n\n1. **Dog's Eye**: The left image has a fully colored eye, while the right image has a different shape or shading in the eye.\n2. **Dog's Collar**: The collar color or design may differ between the two images.\n3. **Dog's Tail**: The position or appearance of the dog's tail might be altered.\n4. **Food Bowl**: The contents or design of the food bowl could be different.\n5. **Flower**: The flower in the foreground may have a different number of petals or color.\n6. **House Color**: The color of the doghouse might vary (shade or hue).\n7. **Fence**: The design or number of planks in the fence could be different.\n8. **Grass**: The grass texture or shape might have slight variations.\n9. **Pathway**: The shape or pattern of the pathway could differ.\n10. **Background Elements**: There may be differences in the trees or clouds in the background.\n\nThese differences can be subtle, so careful observation is key!\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately identify differences in dog's eye, collar, posture of the dog's leg, bowl contents, flower, stone, fence knot, grass near the fence, dog house window, and bush.",
