Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHelp me simplify this equation in a clever way\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo simplify the equation, we can follow the steps of cross multiplication and use the distributive property.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the two fractions with common numerators and denominators:\n\n(1/2) x (8/4) = 2/4 = 1/2\n\nSo, we can simplify the equation as:\n\n(1/2) + (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2) = 2/2 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can take the simplified equation to its next level by factoring the numerator and denominator:\n\n(1/2) = 2/4 = (1/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/2 - 1/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\nThis means the equation is already simplified and there are no further steps to take. The final answer is 0.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo simplify the given complex fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{x}{x+1} + 1}{1 - \\frac{x}{x-1}}\n\\]\n\nwe can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Numerator\n\nCombine the terms in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{x+1} + 1 = \\frac{x}{x+1} + \\frac{x+1}{x+1} = \\frac{x + (x + 1)}{x + 1} = \\frac{2x + 1}{x + 1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Denominator\n\nNow simplify the denominator:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{x}{x-1} = \\frac{x-1}{x-1} - \\frac{x}{x-1} = \\frac{x - 1 - x}{x - 1} = \\frac{-1}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Results\n\nNow we can rewrite the complex fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{2x + 1}{x + 1}}{\\frac{-1}{x - 1}} = \\frac{2x + 1}{x + 1} \\cdot \\frac{x - 1}{-1} = \\frac{-(2x + 1)(x - 1)}{x + 1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Simplification\n\nDistributing the negative:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-(2x^2 - 2x + x - 1)}{x + 1} = \\frac{-2x^2 + 3x - 1}{x + 1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of the original complex fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-2x^2 + 3x - 1}{x + 1}\n\\] \n\nThis is the final simplified expression.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. The correct simplification of the given complex fraction equation is (-2*x**2 + x + 1)/(x + 1).\n2. Explanation or steps showing the simplification process.\n3. Final answer should be mathematically equivalent to the original equation.",
