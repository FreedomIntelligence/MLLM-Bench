    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the current motion of the vehicles, predict their trajectories in the next few seconds. What can drivers do to avoid collision?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo predict the trajectories of the vehicles in the image, we can consider the following factors based on their current motion:\n\n1. **Direction of Movement**: The white vehicle appears to be turning left while the blue vehicle is moving straight. If both vehicles maintain their current speed and direction, they may intersect at the intersection.\n\n2. **Speed**: If the vehicles are traveling at a higher speed, the time to collision will be shorter. Slower speeds may provide more time for drivers to react.\n\n3. **Road Conditions**: The snowy conditions can significantly affect traction, making it harder for vehicles to stop or maneuver quickly.\n\n### Predictions:\n- The white vehicle, if it continues turning left, will likely move into the path of the blue vehicle unless it stops or alters its course.\n- The blue vehicle, assuming it continues straight, will likely collide with the white vehicle if no action is taken.\n\n### Avoiding Collision:\nDrivers can take the following actions to avoid a collision:\n\n1. **Reduce Speed**: Slowing down can provide more time to react to other vehicles and obstacles.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Maintaining a safe distance can help in reacting to sudden stops or changes in direction.\n\n3. **Use Indicators**: Clearly signaling intentions can help other drivers anticipate movements.\n\n4. **Brake Gently**: In slippery conditions, sudden braking can lead to loss of control. Gentle braking can help maintain traction.\n\n5. **Stay Alert**: Constantly monitoring the surroundings can help in making quick decisions.\n\n6. **Avoid Distractions**: Keeping focus on the road can aid in quicker reactions to potential hazards.\n\nBy applying these strategies, drivers can significantly reduce the risk of collision in adverse weather conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, one car is driving in front of another car, and they appear to be close to each other. Since the cars are driving in the same direction, it is difficult to predict their exact trajectories in the next few seconds, as they are situated in the middle of a road with buildings lining up. However, it is important for the drivers to be aware of their surroundings, maintain a safe distance from each other, and continuously check their blind spots to avoid any potential collision. To enhance safety, drivers can also slow down based on road conditions, use appropriate lighting (headlights, taillights, and turn signals), and follow any traffic rules or regulations to ensure a safe driving environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Predicted trajectories must consider vehicles' current motion and road conditions.\n2. Recommendations for avoiding collision should be specific and plausible.\n3. Answer must align with the action prediction capability and the given instruction.",
