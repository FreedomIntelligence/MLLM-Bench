    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the activities and reactions of the individuals captured in the photographs, as well as the condition of the surrounding environment, hypothesize the specific natural disaster that this region is currently facing?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a large group of people walking through knee-deep water, carrying luggage and backpacks, as well as wearing clothes suitable for cold weather. This indicates that the region is experiencing a significant flood, possibly triggered by heavy rainfall or a natural disaster leading to the overflow of a river or a large body of water. The situation appears to have forced people to evacuate their homes and seek higher ground, as evidenced by the group of people walking through the water and the presence of various types of bags and belongings. Residents may need to rely on alternative forms of transportation, such as boats or floats, depending on the severity of the flood. The weather seems cold, which can increase the discomfort and risks associated with navigating through flooded areas.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the activities and reactions of the individuals in the photograph, as well as the surrounding environment, it appears that this region is currently experiencing severe flooding. The presence of people wading through water while carrying belongings suggests that they are evacuating or seeking safety from rising water levels. The flooded streets and the condition of the environment indicate significant rainfall or potential overflow from nearby bodies of water, which are common causes of flooding disasters.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the natural disaster as a flood, based on water inundation and people's reactions.\n2. Assess if the answer considers the environment's condition, like submerged paths.\n3. Evaluate the logical reasoning linking the activities in the image to the flood.",
