    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDiscuss how the costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe costume, accessories, and expression of the individual work in harmony to create a comedic character that evokes humor through visual cues and playful elements. \n\nThe costume features bright, mismatched colors and patterns, which immediately draw attention and suggest a lighthearted, whimsical persona. The exaggerated shapes, like the pointed hat with bells, add an element of absurdity, enhancing the comedic effect. \n\nAccessories play a crucial role; the beaded necklaces and playful buttons, such as \"Mostly Harmless\" and \"IDIOT,\" serve as humorous props that contribute to the character's quirky identity. These elements invite laughter by juxtaposing the playful attire with self-deprecating messages.\n\nWhile the expression is not visible, the overall presentation suggests a jovial demeanor, likely characterized by a playful or exaggerated smile. This combination of costume, accessories, and expression creates a character that is approachable and entertaining, embodying the essence of a jester or fool who brings joy and laughter to those around them.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe costume, accessories, and the individual's expression work together to create a comedic character through various elements that contribute to the overall effect. The man is wearing a clown costume, which already has a humorous and exaggerated look. He is also dressed like a jester, further emphasizing the comedic nature of his appearance. Additionally, he is wearing a funny hat and a beard, adding to the overall goofy and lighthearted vibe of the character.\n\nThe individual's expression contributes to the comedic effect of the scene. He is making a funny face, likely indicating that he is posing for a joke or entertaining others. His wide open eyes and the playful pose make the character even more amusing.\n\nLastly, the man is holding a cup or a metal mug, which could be used as a prop for his humorous act or a drink for a celebration.
