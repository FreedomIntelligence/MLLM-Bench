    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCritique the ad's implication of female competence and its potential impact on stereotypes.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a woman opening a bottle of ketchup, with the phrase \"you mean a woman can open it\" in white text, which implies that it is usually associated with men. This kind of stereotype perpetuates the notion that women are not as capable as men in tasks that involve physical strength and dexterity. This can have negative consequences on societal expectations and attitudes towards women, leading to a lack of opportunities, unequality, and limited perception of women's abilities. Such an advertisement may also promote the idea that women need to prove their competence in performing tasks that are typically considered \"manly\", reinforcing gender stereotypes and limiting the potential of women.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe ad presents a problematic implication regarding female competence by suggesting that a woman’s ability to perform a simple task, like opening a bottle, is surprising. This reinforces outdated stereotypes that women are less capable than men in practical matters. \n\nBy framing the message in a way that implies disbelief at a woman’s competence, the ad perpetuates a narrative that women are weaker or less skilled, which can have a detrimental impact on societal perceptions. Such portrayals can contribute to the normalization of gender stereotypes, discouraging women from pursuing roles or tasks traditionally viewed as male-dominated.\n\nAdditionally, this kind of messaging can affect women's self-perception and confidence, leading them to internalize these stereotypes. Overall, the ad reflects and perpetuates a narrow view of gender roles, which can hinder progress toward gender equality and reinforce harmful biases in both personal and professional contexts.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response recognizes the ad's implied message about female competence.\n2. Assess the response's insight on the ad's reinforcement or challenge of gender stereotypes.\n3. Evaluate the response's consideration of the potential societal impact of such stereotypes.",
