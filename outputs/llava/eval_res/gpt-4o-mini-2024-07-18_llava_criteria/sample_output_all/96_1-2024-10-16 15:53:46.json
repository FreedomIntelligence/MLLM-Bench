    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the art movement that the artwork represent and describe the unique stylistic features that could help identify the artist or the school of art it belongs to.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe artwork appears to represent the Cubist movement, known for its unique stylistic features that often include fragmentation and distortion of objects and figures. In this case, the woman's face is depicted through a series of geometric shapes and planes, emphasizing the artistic choices that were characteristic of Cubism. The distorted face and the vibrant palette of colors further emphasize the distinctive approach to representing the subject matter in Cubist art. This style was popularized by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 20th century, and their works often aimed to challenge traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe artwork represents the **Expressionism** movement. \n\nUnique stylistic features that can help identify this art movement include:\n\n1. **Bold Colors**: Expressionist works often use vivid, non-naturalistic colors to convey emotion rather than realism.\n\n2. **Distorted Forms**: Figures and objects may be exaggerated or distorted to express feelings or ideas, rather than to depict them accurately.\n\n3. **Emphasis on Emotion**: The overall mood of the artwork is often intense and emotional, focusing on the artist's subjective experience.\n\n4. **Dynamic Brushwork**: The application of paint is often energetic and spontaneous, contributing to a sense of movement and urgency.\n\n5. **Symbolism**: Elements within the artwork may carry deeper meanings, reflecting the artist's thoughts and feelings about society, politics, or personal experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are indicative of the Expressionist style and can help in identifying works associated with this movement.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identifies the art movement as Cubism.\n2. Describes unique features like geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and fragmented objects.\n3. Mentions stylistic attributes indicating the artist or school of Cubism.",
