    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe animal is a colorful bird with a striking appearance. It has a black and orange body, a white head, blue eyes, and a long beak. The bird's beak is quite large, and it seems to be stretching or yawning its mouth while perched on a tree branch. The bird's vibrant colors and unique features make it easily distinguishable and visually interesting.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis bird has a striking appearance characterized by its vibrant colors and distinctive features. Here are some details to help with recognition:\n\n1. **Beak**: The most notable feature is its large, colorful beak, which is typically long and curved. The upper mandible is often black, while the lower mandible may have shades of blue or yellow.\n\n2. **Head**: The head is adorned with a striking blue coloration around the eyes and throat, contrasting sharply with the darker feathers on the crown.\n\n3. **Body**: The body is predominantly black, with a bright orange or reddish-orange patch on the chest and belly. This coloration adds to its vibrant appearance.\n\n4. **Wings**: The wings are also black and may have hints of iridescence, especially in the sunlight.\n\n5. **Tail**: The tail is long and pointed, often black, matching the overall body coloration.\n\n6. **Legs and Feet**: The legs are relatively short, and the feet are zygodactyl, meaning they have two toes facing forward and two backward, which helps in gripping branches.\n\n7. **Habitat**: This bird is commonly found in tropical forests, often perched on branches where it can easily spot fruits and insects.\n\nThese features make this bird easily recognizable in its natural habitat.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
