Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGenerate a dense caption detailing the various constellations depicted in the historical star map, including their names, the shapes they are associated with, and any notable stars or celestial objects contained within them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe historical star map depicts various constellations in a large circle. These constellations are named after the celestial objects they represent or are associated with. Some of the constellations include Orion, which is known for its prominent hunter figure with a shield and club. Another notable constellation is Cetus, which is shaped like a sea monster and contains the star Mirach. Additionally, there is Lepus, a small constellation situated near Orion, with a hare as its mascot. The diverse shapes and names of the constellations, along with the inclusion of notable stars like Mirach, make this historical star map fascinating and a testament to the rich history of celestial observations and cataloguing.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis historical star map showcases a rich tapestry of constellations, each with distinct shapes and notable celestial objects. \n\n1. **Pisces** - Represented as two fish, this constellation contains the notable stars Alrescha and Fum al Samakah.\n2. **Aries** - Shaped like a ram, it features the prominent star Hamal.\n3. **Taurus** - Depicted as a bull, it includes the bright star Aldebaran and the Pleiades star cluster.\n4. **Gemini** - Illustrated as twin figures, it highlights the stars Castor and Pollux.\n5. **Cancer** - Shown as a crab, it contains the Beehive Cluster (M44).\n6. **Leo** - Represented as a lion, it features the bright star Regulus.\n7. **Virgo** - Depicted as a maiden, it includes the bright star Spica.\n8. **Libra** - Shaped like a set of scales, it contains the star Zubenelgenubi.\n9. **Scorpius** - Illustrated as a scorpion, it features the bright star Antares.\n10. **Sagittarius** - Represented as an archer, it includes the Lagoon Nebula (M8).\n11. **Capricornus** - Depicted as a sea-goat, it contains the star Deneb Algedi.\n12. **Aquarius** - Shown as a water bearer, it features the star Sadalsuud.\n13. **Pisces Austrinus** - Represented as the southern fish, it includes the star Fomalhaut.\n14. **Perseus** - Illustrated as a hero, it contains the famous variable star Algol.\n15. **Andromeda** - Shown as a princess, it includes the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).\n16. **Draco** - Depicted as a dragon, it features the star Thuban, once the pole star.\n17. **Hercules** - Represented as a hero, it includes the Great Hercules Cluster (M13).\n18. **Cygnus** - Shown as a swan, it features the bright star Deneb.\n19. **Lyra** - Illustrated as a lyre, it includes the brilliant star Vega.\n20. **Aquila** - Depicted as an eagle, it features the star Altair.\n\nThis intricate map not only highlights the shapes and names of these constellations but also emphasizes their significant stars and celestial objects, providing a glimpse into the rich history of astronomy.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify constellations by name and describe their shapes accurately.\n2. Mention any notable stars or celestial objects within the constellations.\n3. Ensure the description is detailed, reflecting the historical context of the star map.",
