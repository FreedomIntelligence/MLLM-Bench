    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the damage of the shoe. Is it a safety hazard to keep wearing this shoe?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo evaluate the damage of the shoe, consider the following aspects:\n\n1. **Outsole Wear**: The visible wear on the outsole, especially if there's significant loss of tread, can reduce traction, which may lead to slips and falls.\n\n2. **Structural Integrity**: If there are any cracks or separations in the shoe’s structure, this could affect stability and support.\n\n3. **Comfort**: If the cushioning is compromised, it may lead to discomfort or foot pain during use.\n\n4. **Material Damage**: Any exposed areas may lead to further degradation or potential injury.\n\n### Safety Hazard Assessment\n- **Yes, it can be a safety hazard** if the tread is worn down significantly or if there are structural issues that affect support. \n- If you notice any of the above concerns, it’s advisable to stop wearing the shoe and consider replacing it for safety reasons. \n\nAlways prioritize your safety and comfort when it comes to footwear.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image shows a pink and black shoe with a torn shoe lace, indicating potential wear and tear. While it may not be immediately hazardous, a torn shoe lace can cause discomfort and affect the shoe's functionality. It is advisable to repair the shoe or replace the damaged shoe lace to ensure safety and comfort while wearing the shoe. If left unattended, the shoe lace could break completely, causing the shoe to become loose and increasing the risk of injury.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage to the shoe, including wear, tears, or sole separation.\n2. Assess if the damage compromises the shoe's structural integrity or function.\n3. Determine the potential safety risks of wearing the damaged shoe.",
