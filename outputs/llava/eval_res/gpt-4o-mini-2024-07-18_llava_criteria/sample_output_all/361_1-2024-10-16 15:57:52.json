Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompose a poem about a mountain sunrise, the solitary hiker, and the interplay of dawn light with nature.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the mist, a lone hiker stands\nIn the shadow of the mountain range\nWith the sun rising in the distance,\nHe gazes on the spectacle before him.\n\nThe sky turns shades of purple and red\nAs mountains meet the horizon line\nThe sun peaking from behind its crest\nBringing warmth and life to the scene.\n\nA backpacker, he's made his way to this view\nThrough mountain trails and winding paths\nTo witness the dawn's majestic glow\nOn the peaks and through the valleys.\n\nBut it's not just the sun's golden hue\nThat draws him to the summit's heights\nIt's also the peace and solitude they bring\nThe stillness of the world beneath.\n\nThe hiker embraces the quiet dawn\nAs the sun lifts the mountain's veil\nHe stands in awe, his soul reborn\nAmidst the wonders of nature's tale.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon the crest where silence reigns,  \nA solitary hiker, free from chains,  \nAwaits the dawn with bated breath,  \nAs night retreats, embracing death.  \n\nThe mountains stir in soft embrace,  \nBathed in hues of gold and grace,  \nA canvas stretched, the sky ignites,  \nWith whispers of the coming lights.  \n\nThe sun, a fiery orb on high,  \nPaints shadows long, then bids goodbye  \nTo stars that fade in morning's glow,  \nAs nature wakes from slumber slow.  \n\nEach beam that dances on the stone,  \nReveals the beauty, all alone,  \nThe rustling leaves, the distant streams,  \nAwash in warmth, like waking dreams.  \n\nThe hiker stands, a silhouette,  \nIn harmony with the sun's duet,  \nA moment held, a breath, a sigh,  \nAs day unfolds, the world awry.  \n\nWith every step, the path unwinds,  \nThrough valleys deep and mountains blind,  \nIn dawn's embrace, the spirit soars,  \nA journey born on nature's shores.  \n\nSo let the sunrise guide the way,  \nFor in its light, the heart will stay,  \nIn solitude, a bond we find,  \nWith mountain peaks and the dawn’s kind.  \n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes mountain sunrise, solitary hiker, and dawn light with nature.\n2. Imagery captures the beauty and interplay of light in nature.\n3. Tone conveys the mood and experience of a solitary hike at dawn.",
