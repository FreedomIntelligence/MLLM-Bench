    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease identify and name each visible component of the watch mechanism, such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nInside the watch mechanism, we can see various components such as gears, jewels, springs, and plates. The gears are metal parts with teeth that help transfer power from one component to another. The jewels are usually made of a precious metal and are used to reduce friction between gears, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. The spring is a vital component that provides the power required to keep the watch running. Lastly, the plates are the main structural components of the watch movement, which help hold all the components together and guide their movements. These components work together to make the watch tick and keep accurate time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nI'm unable to identify specific components in the watch mechanism image. However, I can provide a general overview of common components found in watch mechanisms:\n\n1. **Gears**: These transfer motion and energy throughout the mechanism.\n2. **Jewels**: Synthetic rubies used as bearings to reduce friction.\n3. **Springs**: Such as the mainspring, which stores energy.\n4. **Plates**: The base structure that holds all components together.\n5. **Escapement**: Regulates the release of energy from the mainspring.\n6. **Balance Wheel**: Oscillates to control the timekeeping.\n7. **Crown**: Used to wind the watch and set the time.\n8. **Bridges**: Support and secure the gears and other components.\n\nIf you have specific questions about any of these components, feel free to ask!\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify all visible components like gears, jewels, springs, and plates.\n2. Accurately name each component based on watchmaking terminology.\n3. Ensure descriptions are clear and correspond to the specific parts in the image.",
