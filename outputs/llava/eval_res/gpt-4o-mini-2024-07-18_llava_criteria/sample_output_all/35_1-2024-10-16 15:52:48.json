The red devil or angel emblem within the shield is a graphic representation of the club's nickname, \"The Red Devils.\" This symbol has been a part of the team's identity since 1991, when it replaced the old gold lion crest.\n\nThe text of the logo, \"Manchester United,\" emphasizes the club's location and the fact that it is part of the city of Manchester. By including both the name and the iconography, the logo effectively communicates the club's identity as a professional football team from Manchester, with a strong sense of pride and unity among its fans.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe Manchester United logo is rich in color, iconography, and text, all of which reflect the club's identity and heritage.\n\n### Color\nThe primary colors of the logo are red and yellow.

This element connects the club to its roots and the community it represents.\n- **Football**: The inclusion of footballs on either side of the logo emphasizes the sport at its core, reinforcing the club's identity as a football club.\n\n### Text\nThe club's name, \"Manchester United,\" is prominently displayed in a bold, traditional font.
