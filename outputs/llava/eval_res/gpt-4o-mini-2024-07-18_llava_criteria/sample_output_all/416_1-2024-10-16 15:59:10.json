    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wooden piece is carved into an intricate flower pattern, and it features a star shape in the center, giving the impression of a sunburst.

The design is both symmetrical and asymmetrical, with the flower petals following a regular pattern, yet the varying sizes and shapes of the petals make the overall design feel unique and dynamic. The combination of the carved flower and the starburst center make this piece a striking piece of artistry and craftsmanship.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThis exquisite carved wood panel showcases a mesmerizing interplay of intricate patterns, revealing a stunning depth and texture that draws the eye. The symmetrical design unfolds in layers of delicate petals and geometric shapes, each meticulously crafted to enhance the visual rhythm. The rich tones of the wood accentuate the contrasting lines and curves, creating a dynamic surface that invites exploration. Asymmetrical elements subtly disrupt the flow, adding an organic feel to the overall composition, while the harmonious balance between precision and artistry celebrates the beauty of craftsmanship.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
