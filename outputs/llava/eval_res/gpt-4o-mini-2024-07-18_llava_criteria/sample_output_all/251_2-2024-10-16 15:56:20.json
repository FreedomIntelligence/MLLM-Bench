    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the physical features of the twins to identify subtle differences that may distinguish them.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo distinguish between the twins, you can look for subtle differences in their hair, posture, and clothing. \n\n1. **Hair**: One twin may have a slightly different parting or styling, which can affect how the hair falls around their face.\n\n2. **Posture**: Observe their body language; one may be leaning slightly forward or have a different stance, which can create a distinction.\n\n3. **Clothing**: While both may be wearing similar outfits, there could be small differences in fit or how they are styled, such as different sleeve lengths or accessories.\n\nThese subtle variations can help identify each twin even when their facial features are not visible.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe twins have similar physical features; however, there are subtle differences that can be observed. First, one twin has a mole on her face close to the left side of her nose, while the other has a slight gap between her eyebrows. Second, the twin on the left has longer hair, as it extends beyond the other girl's hair. These small distinctions in their features make them stand out despite their similar appearances.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify facial feature differences such as freckle patterns, eye shape, or smile.\n2. Note hair texture, color variation, or hairstyle distinctions.\n3. Describe any other physical differences, like ear shape or skin tone.",
