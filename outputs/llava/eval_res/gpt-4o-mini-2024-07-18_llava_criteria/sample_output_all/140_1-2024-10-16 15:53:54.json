    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the elements of humor in the meme, and identify the type of humor employed in the meme(e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme features a man and a woman riding in a car with a dog in the front seat, seemingly driving it. The humor in the meme comes from the two phrases displayed in the scene - \"look at that dog\" and \"I hate dogs.\" This creates a sense of irony and parody, as the viewers' expectations are subverted by the dog's presence in the driver's seat. The image evokes humor by challenging the conventional roles of humans and dogs, making the viewer question the reality of the situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe meme employs several humorous elements, primarily through the juxtaposition of contrasting opinions and the unexpected presence of a dog character.\n\n1. **Contrasting Opinions**: The humor arises from the stark contrast between the two characters in the car. One expresses excitement about seeing a dog, while the other states a strong dislike for dogs. This creates a comedic tension, highlighting the absurdity of their differing perspectives.\n\n2. **Absurdity**: The presence of the dog character, which seems to represent an authoritative or confident stance with the phrase \"This is the way!\", adds an element of absurdity. This unexpected twist creates a humorous disconnect between the characters' dialogue and the dog's assertive presence.\n\n3. **Exaggeration**: The exaggerated emotions of the characters—one being overly enthusiastic and the other vehemently opposed—enhance the comedic effect, making the scenario feel exaggerated and ridiculous.\n\nThe type of humor employed here can be classified as **irony** and **absurdism**. The irony lies in the conflicting attitudes toward dogs, while the absurdity is accentuated by the dog's confident assertion, which contrasts sharply with the human dialogue.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the type of humor used (e.g., slapstick, irony, parody).\n2. Analyze the contrast between text and imagery for humor elements.\n3. Explain the meme's punchline or humorous aspect within the context.",
