    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, describe the wound and provide some advice\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe wound in the image is a blister or a callus on the back of someone's hand. It appears to be located at the base of a finger. It is noticeable because someone is holding the hand up in the air to show off the injury.\n\nAs for advice, it is essential to keep the blister clean and free from infection. Avoid picking or scratching the blister, as it may become infected, leading to more problems. If the blister is painful or you are unable to use the hand, consider seeking medical attention to determine if it requires treatment, such as a steroid injection or antibiotics in severe cases. For prevention, avoid placing excessive pressure on the affected area and wear appropriate padding or support if necessary. Keeping the area moisturized by applying ointment or petrolatum can also help in preventing infection and reducing the duration of recovery time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe wound appears to be a blister on the palm of the hand. Blisters are typically caused by friction, burns, or irritation, and they contain a clear fluid.\n\n### Advice for Care:\n\n1. **Keep It Clean**: Gently wash the area with mild soap and water to prevent infection.\n\n2. **Do Not Pop**: Avoid popping the blister, as this can lead to infection. The skin over the blister serves as a natural barrier.\n\n3. **Protect the Area**: Cover the blister with a sterile bandage or gauze to protect it from further irritation or injury.\n\n4. **Monitor for Infection**: Watch for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or pus. If these occur, seek medical attention.\n\n5. **Let It Heal**: Allow the blister to heal naturally. Once it has dried up and the skin has healed, you can remove the bandage.\n\nIf you have concerns about the wound or if it doesn't improve, consider consulting a healthcare professional.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately describe the wound's appearance including size, shape, and color.\n2. Provide basic first aid advice relevant to the wound's characteristics.\n3. Mention the importance of cleanliness to prevent infection.",
