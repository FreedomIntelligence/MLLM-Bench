    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the hands of the anime character and briefly describe the use and techniques of this object.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe object in the hands of the anime character is a saxophone. \n\n### Use and Techniques of the Saxophone:\n\n1. **Sound Production**: The saxophone produces sound by the vibration of a single reed, which is attached to a mouthpiece. The player blows air through the mouthpiece, causing the reed to vibrate.\n\n2. **Techniques**:\n   - **Breath Control**: Players must manage their breath to produce a steady tone and control dynamics.\n   - **Fingerings**: Different combinations of keys are pressed to produce various notes. Mastery of fingerings is crucial for fluid playing.\n   - **Articulation**: Techniques like staccato (short, detached notes) and legato (smooth, connected notes) enhance expressiveness.\n   - **Vibrato**: A slight fluctuation in pitch, created by varying air pressure, adds warmth and emotion to the sound.\n\n3. **Genres**: The saxophone is versatile and is used in various music genres, including jazz, classical, and pop, often serving as both a lead instrument and a part of ensembles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe anime character is holding a trombone, which is a musical instrument used to produce sound by vibrating the air inside it. The trombone is made of a long metal tube, with a flared bell at the end, and has a sliding mechanism that allows the player to change notes. The trombone uses brass and slide techniques to produce various tones and notes, making it a versatile instrument in different musical genres such as jazz, classical, and military marching bands.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a saxophone.\n2. Describe the saxophone's use as a musical instrument.\n3. Mention the technique of blowing into it to produce sound.",
