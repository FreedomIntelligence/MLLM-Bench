    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease examine the nuances within the image and provide an analysis of the potential relationship between the two individuals engaged in a handshake.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a man and a woman are sitting across from each other at a wooden dining table, shaking hands. Their handshake could imply a variety of relationships or scenarios, such as the completion of a successful business deal, the beginning of an important negotiation, the conclusion of a job interview, or an acknowledgment of a job well done. Although it's difficult to definitively determine the context, the handshake suggests a formal, professional interaction between the two individuals. The presence of cups and books on the table could also indicate that this is a more informal meeting, such as a casual business lunch, where both parties are discussing ideas or reviewing documents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe handshake between the two individuals suggests a moment of agreement or collaboration. This gesture typically signifies a positive interaction, such as the conclusion of a negotiation, the establishment of a partnership, or the finalization of a deal. \n\nThe setting appears to be a professional environment, indicated by the presence of a table with documents and a glass of water, which further emphasizes the formal nature of the meeting. The individual on the left, with glasses and curly hair, seems engaged and enthusiastic, which could indicate a proactive role in the discussion.\n\nThe other individual, dressed in a light-colored blazer, appears focused on the handshake, suggesting attentiveness and a willingness to engage. The presence of a third person in the background, who seems to be observing, could imply that this interaction is part of a larger discussion involving multiple parties.\n\nOverall, the dynamics of the handshake, combined with the professional context, hint at a constructive relationship between the two individuals, likely grounded in shared goals or mutual interests.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotional cues indicating relationship: facial expressions, handshake firmness, body language.\n2. Assess context: clothing style, setting, and any objects suggesting professional or personal meeting.",
