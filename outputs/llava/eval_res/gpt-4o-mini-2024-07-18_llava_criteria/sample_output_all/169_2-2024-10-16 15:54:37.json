    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the steps to properly open a new book as detailed in the image, and evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the instructions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo properly open a new book, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Place the Book**: Set the book with its back facing down on a table.\n2. **Open the Front Cover**: Let the front cover fall open.\n3. **Open the Back Cover**: Then let the back cover fall open.\n4. **Open Front Leaves**: Open a few pages from the front.\n5. **Open Back Leaves**: Open a few pages from the back, alternating between the front and back.\n6. **Press Down**: Gently press down on the pages until the center is reached.\n7. **Repeat**: Perform these actions two or three times to limber up the binding.\n\n### Evaluation of Clarity and Effectiveness:\n\n- **Clarity**: The instructions are clear and straightforward, using simple language and a step-by-step format. The accompanying illustrations enhance understanding by visually representing each step.\n  \n- **Effectiveness**: The method promotes careful handling of a new book, which is effective in preventing damage to the binding. The warning against forcing the back is particularly useful, as it emphasizes the importance of gentle treatment.\n\nOverall, the instructions are well-structured and effectively convey the proper technique for opening a new book without causing harm.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features various steps on how to open a new book. These instructions can be followed to open the book properly and ensure that the pages will lay flat and be easy to read. The steps include:\n\n1. Place the book on a flat surface (such as a table) with the spine facing down.\n2. Hold the book firmly at the head (top edge), lifting the volume gently.\n3. Holding the book to the left, turn the volume backward with your thumb on top.\n4. Turn the volume backward while holding it firmly.\n5. Hold the book to the left, pressing gently on the head so that it bends slightly.\n6. Hold the book to the left, allowing the head to bend even more.\n7. Hold the book to the left, press the spine against the surface to keep the spine intact, and lift the volume flat with the top facing down.\n\nThe instructions provided are clear and straightforward, which should allow the reader to follow the steps correctly. However, considering that this is an illustrated guide from the 1920s, the modern reader might find the instructions slightly old-fashioned. There might be more efficient ways to open a book today, but the guide still offers a basic method to achieve the desired results.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. List steps to open a new book: place on table, front cover, back cover, alternate leaves, press gently, repeat if needed.\n2. Assess if instructions are clear: sequential order, simple language, easy to follow.\n3. Evaluate effectiveness: steps lead to opening without damaging the book's binding.",
