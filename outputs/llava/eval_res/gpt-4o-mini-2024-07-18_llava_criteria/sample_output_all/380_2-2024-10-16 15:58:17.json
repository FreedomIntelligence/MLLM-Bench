    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the player's current motion and positioning relative to the soccer ball to predict the success of the save, and the consequent positioning of players following the save attempt.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the goalkeeper appears to be in mid-air, reaching for a ball that is likely heading toward the upper corner of the goal. His positioning suggests he is attempting a save, and the success of this attempt will depend on several factors:\n\n1. **Reach and Timing**: The goalkeeper's arm extension and vertical leap indicate he is making a committed effort to intercept the ball. If he can make contact, he may successfully deflect it away from the goal.\n\n2. **Ball Trajectory**: The ball's height and direction will significantly affect the save's outcome. If it is too far above his reach or angled away, he may not be able to make the save.\n\n3. **Positioning of Other Players**: The players in red and white are positioned in a way that suggests they are ready to react depending on the outcome. If the goalkeeper misses or deflects the ball, the players in red (particularly the one wearing number 10) seem poised to capitalize on any rebound, while the white players may be positioned to either defend or counterattack.\n\nIn the event of a successful save, the goalkeeper's momentum might carry him forward, creating an opportunity for the red team to quickly transition into an offensive position as they anticipate a rebound. Conversely, if the save is unsuccessful, the players in red will likely rush toward the goal to follow up on the potential scoring opportunity. Overall, the dynamics following the save attempt will hinge on the immediate reactions of all players involved.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe goalkeeper has stretched his arms out to catch the soccer ball and seems to be in a good position to save it. The ball is still in the air, and the goalkeeper is focused on stopping it. Based on the position of the players on the field, there are a total of 10 outfield players and 3 goalkeepers from both teams.\n\nFollowing the save, the goalkeeper will likely throw the ball back towards the other end of the field, and the outfield players will reposition themselves to recover possession or defend against the opposing team's next attack. The player who shot the ball (number 10) will likely try to move towards the goal area or the center of the field to create a scoring opportunity for his team. Players from both teams are likely to adjust their positions to maintain a defensive or attacking stance, depending on their teammates' actions, the ball's direction, and the momentary game situation regarding possession and scoring opportunities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess goalkeeper's motion and likelihood of reaching the ball for a save.\n2. Predict the ball's trajectory post-save and players' subsequent positions.\n3. Evaluate the positioning and potential actions of nearby outfield players.",
