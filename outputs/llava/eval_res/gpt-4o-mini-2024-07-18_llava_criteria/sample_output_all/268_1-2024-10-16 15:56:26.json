    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThis circuit board seems to be unusable. Please speculate on the reason based on the picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBased on the image, the circuit board appears to be burnt, which suggests that a short circuit or an electrical issue has occurred, causing it to catch on fire and become damaged. The burnt portion of the board indicates that it has been exposed to high temperatures or heat, leading to its current state. The presence of a mouse on top of the damaged board further implies that it might be unusable, as the mouse could inadvertently cause additional damage or even spark a further fire. The reasons for the short circuit could vary, such as an incorrect connection, faulty component, or an external electrical source causing the malfunction.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, several potential issues could render the circuit board unusable:\n\n1. **Burnt Components**: There appears to be a darkened area near some components, suggesting overheating or damage, which could lead to circuit failure.\n\n2. **Damaged Traces**: If any traces on the board are burnt or broken, this can interrupt the flow of electricity, causing the circuit to malfunction.\n\n3. **Corrosion or Contamination**: Any signs of corrosion or debris on the board can impact electrical connections and performance.\n\n4. **Missing or Damaged Components**: If any resistors, capacitors, or other components are missing or damaged, this could prevent the circuit from functioning properly.\n\n5. **Solder Issues**: Poor solder joints or cold solder connections can lead to unreliable electrical connections.\n\nThese factors combined could lead to the circuit board being deemed unusable without repair.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer specifies \"burnt components\" or \"short circuits\" as reasons for unusability.",
