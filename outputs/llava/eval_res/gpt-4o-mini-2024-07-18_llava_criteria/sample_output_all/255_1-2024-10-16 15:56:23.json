    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, examine the illustration of the big cats and articulate the differences in their species-specific features. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features four different big cat species, showcasing their unique features. The tiger has a distinctive black and orange striped pattern across its body, while the lion displays a rich mane of fur along its neck. The panther and leopard share a similar body shape, but the panther is larger and displays a spotted pattern, while the leopard features a more delicate and lighter-colored spotted print on its body. All four species share the common characteristic of having powerful, muscular bodies and strong limbs, which are typical features of their respective natural habitats and behaviors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the illustration of big cats, we can observe distinct species-specific features that help differentiate them:\n\n1. **Tiger**: Tigers are characterized by their striking orange coat with black stripes. They have a robust body, long legs, and a large head. Their facial structure includes prominent whiskers and a strong jaw, adapted for hunting.\n\n2. **Lion**: Lions are notable for their majestic mane, particularly in males, which is unique among big cats. Their body is muscular and stocky, with a broad head and powerful limbs. Lions often exhibit a social structure, living in prides.\n\n3. **Leopard**: Leopards have a more slender build compared to lions and tigers. They feature a golden-yellow coat adorned with rosettes, which provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. Their climbing ability is enhanced by their strong limbs and flexible body.\n\n4. **Cougar (Mountain Lion)**: Cougars have a uniform tawny coat without the distinctive spots or stripes found in other big cats. They possess a long tail and a more agile, elongated body, which aids in their adaptability to various terrains.\n\nThese features not only reflect their adaptations to different environments but also their hunting strategies and social behaviors.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify species-specific features of tiger, puma, male lion, and female lion on aspects such as fur patterns and body size.",
