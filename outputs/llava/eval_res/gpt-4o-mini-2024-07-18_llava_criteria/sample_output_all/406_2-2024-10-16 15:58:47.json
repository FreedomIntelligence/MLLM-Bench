    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the cats and the environment of the image detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a ginger cat lying on a smooth, sunlit surface. Its fur is a warm orange with distinct stripes, and it has large, expressive eyes that seem curious and alert. The cat is positioned comfortably, stretched out with its front paws tucked under its body, which gives it a relaxed appearance.\n\nThe environment surrounding the cat is an urban setting, likely near a building. The background features large windows that reflect the sunlight, suggesting a bright day. The architecture appears modern, with clean lines and a minimalist design. There are also vertical poles and a smooth concrete surface, enhancing the urban feel. The overall atmosphere is calm and inviting, with the warm sunlight creating a cozy spot for the cat to rest.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a very cute and fat orange cat lying on a sidewalk next to a building. The cat is resting comfortably, taking up most of the available space on the sidewalk. The environment includes tall buildings nearby, with a large one prominently visible in the background. Additionally, there is a potted plant located closer to the left side of the scene, adding some greenery to the urban setting.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify cat's features: color, posture, expression.\n2. Describe the immediate environment: flooring, objects nearby, building details.\n3. Mention lighting and time of day if apparent from the image.",
