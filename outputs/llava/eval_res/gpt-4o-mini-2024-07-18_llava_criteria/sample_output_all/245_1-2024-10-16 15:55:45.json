    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the texture of the skin of fruits in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the apple has a smooth, glossy skin, while the orange has a rough, slightly textured skin.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe texture of the skin of the two fruits in the image differs significantly. \n\nThe green fruit typically has a smooth, shiny surface, which can feel firm and crisp to the touch. This texture often indicates freshness and juiciness.\n\nIn contrast, the orange fruit features a dimpled, rough texture with a pebbly surface. This texture is characteristic of citrus fruits and contributes to its thicker skin, which helps protect the fruit inside.\n\nOverall, while one fruit has a sleek and smooth appearance, the other is more textured and rugged, highlighting their distinct characteristics.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Mention apple's smooth, glossy skin and orange's dimpled, pebbled texture.",
