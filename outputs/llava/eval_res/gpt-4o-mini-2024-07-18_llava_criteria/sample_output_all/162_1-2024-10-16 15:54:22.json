    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, analyze the emotive language used in the headlines and its potential impact on readers.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe headlines in the image exude a strong emotional impact on readers by using words like \"come for,\" \"and you come,\" and \"for us all.\" These phrases suggest that the readers are directly involved and have a stake in the matter being discussed in the article. The headlines use bold language to capture the audience's attention and evoke feelings of urgency, unity, or involvement. Such an emotive language can be effective in grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the content, increasing the chances of them being more receptive to the message the article is trying to convey.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe headlines in the image utilize emotive language that aims to evoke strong feelings in the readers. Phrases such as \"brands teacher's murderer ‘evil’\" and \"heart-rending story\" are designed to elicit sympathy and outrage, drawing attention to the severity of the crime and the emotional impact on the victims' families.\n\nThe use of the term \"evil\" is particularly potent, as it not only characterizes the perpetrator in a negative light but also stirs a visceral reaction from the audience. This language reinforces a moral dichotomy, positioning the reader to feel justified anger and sorrow.\n\nIn the second headline, \"COME FOR SUELLA AND YOU COME FOR US ALL,\" the language is confrontational and urgent. It suggests a collective threat, which can foster a sense of solidarity among readers who may feel similarly protective. This type of language can galvanize public opinion and potentially mobilize political action, as it frames the issue as one of communal stakes rather than individual grievances.\n\nOverall, the emotive language serves to engage readers on an emotional level, potentially influencing their perceptions and reactions to the issues presented in the articles.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify emotive language in headlines and specify its emotional tone (e.g., \"evil\", \"heart-rending\").\n2. Explain how the chosen language could influence readers' emotions or perceptions.",
