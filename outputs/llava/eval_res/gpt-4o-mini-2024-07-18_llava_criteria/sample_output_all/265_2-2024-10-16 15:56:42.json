    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat circumstances could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThere are several circumstances that could lead to a person lying on the floor in a public corridor surrounded by papers:\n\n1. **Medical Emergency**: The person might have experienced a medical issue, such as a fainting spell, heart attack, or seizure.\n\n2. **Accidental Fall**: They could have tripped or lost their balance, causing them to fall and scatter papers in the process.\n\n3. **Work-Related Stress**: The individual might be overwhelmed by work or stress, leading to a dramatic collapse or breakdown.\n\n4. **Prank or Performance**: It could be part of a prank, art installation, or performance art where the individual is intentionally lying there.\n\n5. **Exhaustion**: They might be extremely tired or fatigued, possibly from working long hours, leading them to lie down momentarily.\n\n6. **Alcohol or Substance Use**: The person could be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, resulting in them being unable to maintain their balance or composure.\n\n7. **Emergency Situation**: There could be a broader emergency, such as a fire drill or evacuation, causing chaos and resulting in someone lying down in the corridor.\n\nIn any case, if someone is found in such a situation, it would be important to check on their well-being and call for help if needed.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThere could be several circumstances that result in a person lying on the floor in a public corridor, surrounded by papers. Some possible scenarios include:\n\n1. The person might have experienced a sudden, unexpected fall while working or studying, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the floor.\n2. The individual could be overwhelmed with the workload, resulting in the papers spilling and accumulating around them as they lie on the ground, unable to continue.\n3. It's possible that the person is dealing with a physical or mental health issue that has led to them lying on the floor in a disorganized state, causing the papers to spread around.\n4. The person might have been overexerting themselves, causing them to collapse from exhaustion and land on the ground with their papers.\n\nRegardless of the specific cause, this situation highlights the importance of not only maintaining a proper workspace but also taking care of one's health and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference wet floor; evaluate if the answer includes slipping due to wet floor as a cause.\n2. Other reasonable answers such as sudden internal illness of the man are also acceptable.",
