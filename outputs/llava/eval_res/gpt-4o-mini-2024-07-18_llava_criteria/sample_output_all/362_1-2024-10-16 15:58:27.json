Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a winter ballad on the solitude and muffled world under snow, reflecting life's resilience in a monochrome setting.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAmidst the snow-covered scene, a man alone walks\nHis solitary steps echo in the crunchy ground\nSilent, muffled, the world around him hushes\nThe snow-muffled world, a monochrome landscape\n\nThe trees and buildings wear a white shroud\nBare branches stretch, reaching out frozen hands\nThe wind howls through the streets, whipped by the snow\nAs the man walks, his footprints swiftly fade away\n\nIn this frozen world, life's resilience lives on\nAmidst the white and grey, a colorless but persistent hue\nA man, though the snow may cover, continues on his way\nEmbracing the cold, the winter's melancholy song he'll sing\n\nIn the end, the snow will melt, and the world revealed\nThe man may find warmth, and perhaps, a heart to mend\nBut until then, in this solitude, he braves the cold\nA lone figure in a silent, snow-muffled world.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**Winter's Whisper**\n\nIn the hush of falling snow,  \nWhere shadows blend and softly flow,  \nA world wrapped tight in white embrace,  \nEach step a dance, a measured pace.  \n\nThe streets, they wear a muffled shroud,  \nAs whispers of the wind grow loud,  \nYet in this monochrome expanse,  \nLife's quiet pulse begins to dance.  \n\nBeneath the weight of winter's hand,  \nResilience blooms in frozen land,  \nFor every flake that drifts and sways,  \nA promise waits for brighter days.  \n\nThe trees stand tall in silent grace,  \nTheir branches draped in nature's lace,  \nWhile footprints trace a fleeting line,  \nA testament to hearts that shine.  \n\nSo let the snow fall soft and deep,  \nIn solitude, the soul can leap,  \nFor in the stillness, strength is found,  \nA symphony in silence, profound.  \n\nAs winter wraps the world in white,  \nRemember, life ignites the night,  \nIn every flurry, every chill,  \nA spark of warmth, a steadfast will.  \n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Includes imagery of solitude, snow's muffled world, and monochrome setting.\n2. Reflects life's resilience in the context of a winter scene.\n3. Structured as a ballad with appropriate tone and style.",
