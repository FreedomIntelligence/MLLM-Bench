Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf the container in the top left corner in the picture was filled with boiling water at 100°C, will people likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle? \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nYes, if the container in the top left corner is filled with boiling water at 100°C, it is likely that someone holding it could be scalded. Most containers are not designed to insulate against such high temperatures, so the exterior could become very hot to the touch, posing a burn risk. It's important to use insulated containers designed for hot liquids to prevent such accidents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nYes, people are likely to be scalded if they hold the bottle containing boiling water at 100°C without using proper protective measures like oven mitts or a thick towel. The hot water can cause burns to their hands, especially if the bottle is made of a heat-conductive material, such as plastic. It is important to handle hot containers with care and use appropriate protective equipment to avoid accidents and injuries.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Reference the insulated nature of the bottle and the unlikelihood of scalding.\n2. Include reasoning on the physical properties of insulation.",
