    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict the dancer's landing technique, and suggest the next movements that would follow.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe dancer appears to be executing a jump, likely preparing for a landing that emphasizes control and grace. Upon landing, a common technique would involve bending the knees to absorb the impact, maintaining a low center of gravity to ensure stability.\n\nFollowing the landing, the dancer might transition into a series of fluid movements, such as:\n\n1. **Arm Flow**: Extending the arms gracefully to create a visual line and maintain momentum.\n2. **Turn or Spin**: Executing a turn to shift direction, possibly leading into a pirouette.\n3. **Floor Work**: Transitioning into a low position or a roll to add variety and depth to the choreography.\n4. **Dynamic Pose**: Ending with a striking pose to emphasize the completion of the movement sequence.\n\nThese movements would enhance the overall performance, showcasing both technical skill and artistic expression.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the woman in the blue dress appears to be in the middle of a ballet move, with her arms and legs extended. As she appears to be dancing on the pavement in front of a building, she might be performing an outdoor dance or show. Since she seems to be in mid-air, it is likely that she will be performing a controlled landing, which involves bending her knees slightly to absorb the impact of her feet touching the pavement. Once she lands, she might continue her dance, possibly following a specific choreography or improvising her movements. The next movements could include graceful footwork, turns, or even more aerial maneuvers, depending on the style and complexity of the dance being performed.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Accurately predict the dancer's landing technique based on body posture and movement direction.\n2. Suggest plausible next dance movements that could logically follow from the landing position.\n3. Ensure the answer reflects a coherent understanding of dance motion and sequence.",
