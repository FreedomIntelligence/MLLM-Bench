    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInterpret the emotion conveyed by the statue and analyze any symbolism that might be associated with the serenity of the expression.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe statue displays a serene and calm expression, as the woman's eyes are half closed, and her lips are together in a peaceful manner. This peacefulness in the statue could symbolize various aspects such as tranquility, inner peace, contentment, or even enlightenment. The statue's serene expression is likely meant to evoke a sense of calmness and harmony, encouraging viewers to connect with their own inner peace and quiet reflection. The decorative headpiece and the overall design of the statue further emphasize the harmony and balance that the figure represents.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe statue conveys a profound sense of serenity, characterized by a calm and composed expression. This tranquility often symbolizes inner peace, wisdom, and compassion, reflecting a state of enlightenment or spiritual fulfillment. \n\nThe serene expression may evoke feelings of comfort and reassurance, suggesting a protective presence. The intricate details of the statue, such as the ornate crown and attire, can symbolize authority and divinity, indicating the figure's elevated status in spiritual or cultural contexts. \n\nAdditionally, the colors and accessories may carry specific meanings—such as the use of orange, which often represents warmth and compassion, while cooler tones can signify tranquility and balance. Overall, the statue serves as a reminder of the importance of inner peace and the pursuit of enlightenment in one's life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the emotion of the statue's expression as serene, peaceful, or similar.\n2. Analyze symbolism related to the statue's serenity, like attire or objects held.",
