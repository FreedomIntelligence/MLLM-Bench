    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a story on the freedom and metaphor of an open, foggy road, symbolizing new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nOn a crisp morning, the world lay draped in a thick blanket of fog, transforming the familiar into a dreamlike landscape. The road stretched ahead, a solitary ribbon of asphalt winding into the unknown. Its yellow line flickered like a beacon, urging the brave to venture forth. \n\nSam stood at the edge, heart racing. Life had been a series of predictable paths, each day blending into the next. But today was different. The fog whispered promises of new beginnings, each wisp a reminder of possibilities yet to be explored. \n\nWith a deep breath, Sam stepped onto the road. The cool air filled his lungs, invigorating him. Each stride felt lighter, as if the weight of past decisions was shedding with every step. The fog wrapped around him, both a shroud and a shield, concealing the distractions of the world behind him.\n\nAs he ran, the sound of his footsteps echoed against the stillness, a rhythmic beat that matched the pulse of his newfound freedom. The road ahead was uncertain, but that uncertainty was exhilarating. It was a canvas, blank and waiting, inviting him to paint his journey with bold strokes.\n\nWith each leap, Sam felt the fog lifting, revealing glimpses of what lay ahead—hills to conquer, valleys to traverse, and perhaps even a few unexpected turns. He embraced the unknown, no longer afraid of where the road would lead. \n\nThis was not just a physical journey; it was a metaphor for life itself. The fog symbolized the fears and doubts that often clouded his mind, while the open road represented the courage to push through, to leap into the possibilities that awaited. \n\nIn that moment, Sam realized that every journey begins with a single step, and every leap into the unknown is a testament to the spirit of adventure that resides within. With the fog as his companion, he ran on, ready to embrace whatever came next.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIt was a misty morning, and the man found himself standing on the side of the road, gazing at its endless possibilities. He was contemplating whether to embark on a new journey, to explore the unknown, or to continue down the familiar paths of his life. As the sun peeked through the fog, he made his decision. Jumping into the air, the man felt the freedom that comes with making that leap, symbolizing his willingness to change, grow, and follow his dreams.\n\nAmidst the foggy road, the man's action serves as a metaphor for the thrill of new beginnings, the excitement of venturing into the unknown, and the courage it takes to leave behind the familiar in search of something greater. As he runs towards the end of the road, he embraces the journey ahead, feeling the adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of taking a leap towards change and personal growth. The road, with its endless possibilities, becomes a blank canvas where his story unfolds, painting a picture of hope, perseverance, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes elements of freedom and metaphorical interpretation of foggy road.\n2. Describes the open road as a symbol of new beginnings or unknown journeys.\n3. Incorporates the visual of the person jumping as part of the narrative.",
