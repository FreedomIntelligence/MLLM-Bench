    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThrough the lens of primate behavior and communication, what might the facial expression and gaze of the gorilla in the image suggest about its current state or intentions?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the gorilla has a somewhat pensive expression on its face, looking upwards with its eyes wide open. This facial expression might suggest that the gorilla is experiencing curiosity, contemplation, or interest in something it sees in the distance. Given their typically gentle and intelligent nature, gorillas are known to exhibit various emotions and facial expressions, and this particular expression could be interpreted as the gorilla trying to understand its environment or engage with its surroundings. It is important to note that as a visual AI assistant, I can only provide descriptions of the gorilla's facial expression based on the available image data, and cannot accurately interpret emotions or intentions without more context.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn primate behavior, facial expressions and gaze can provide significant insights into an individual's emotional state and intentions. For a gorilla, a relaxed facial expression, possibly with a slight openness of the mouth or soft eyes, may indicate calmness or contentment. Conversely, a tense face, narrowed eyes, or a fixed gaze could suggest alertness, discomfort, or even aggression.\n\nThe direction of the gaze is also crucial; direct eye contact in gorillas can be perceived as a challenge, while looking away may demonstrate submission or a non-threatening demeanor. Thus, the combination of facial expression and gaze can reveal whether the gorilla is feeling secure, curious, or potentially threatened, influencing its interactions with others in its environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify specific facial features indicating emotion (e.g., eyes, mouth) related to primate behavior.\n",
