    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the phase of the hunting sequence the eagle is in.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe eagle is in the phase where it is either preparing to catch its prey or has just captured it. In the image, the eagle is in flight and has its wings fanned out, which indicates that it is actively engaged in its hunting process. The eagle could be in the initial stage where it is scanning the surroundings, or it might be in the final stage where it has successfully grabbed its prey and is preparing to return to its nest or another safe location. Eagles typically have exceptional eyesight and precision, making them highly adept at capturing their prey during these flying sequences.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe eagle in the image is likely in the \"capture\" phase of the hunting sequence. It appears to be diving down and has extended its talons, suggesting it is attempting to catch prey from the water.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm eagle has caught prey, based on talon-prey contact and relative position.\n2. Describe the eagle's action, indicating the hunting sequence phase.",
