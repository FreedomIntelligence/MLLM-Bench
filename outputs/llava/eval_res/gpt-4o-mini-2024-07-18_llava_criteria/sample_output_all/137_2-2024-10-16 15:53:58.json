    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the machinery and materials being used by the individual to deduce the artisanal or trade profession\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe individual is using a sewing machine, which indicates they are likely involved in tailoring or garment making. The presence of fabric pieces and a measuring tape suggests they are engaged in creating or altering clothing. This points to a profession in the textile or fashion industry, specifically as a tailor or seamstress. The setup, including the use of a traditional sewing machine, further emphasizes an artisanal approach to their craft.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe individual in the image is using a sewing machine and surrounded by a variety of clothing items. From these observations and the fact that the person is wearing glasses, it is highly probable that they are a tailor, a dressmaker, or someone engaged in the trade of sewing and crafting clothing items. The presence of the numerous garments and hand-crafted items in the background further supports this conclusion.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the trade profession using visible machinery (sewing machine) and materials (fabric).\n2. Assess the context of the setting to support the profession deduced.",
