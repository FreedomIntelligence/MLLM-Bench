    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare and contrast the atmospheric conditions and surface features of the two planets as shown in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the Earth and the red planet, Mars, are displayed side by side in a way that highlights their differences. From the Earth's perspective, we can observe that Mars is much smaller than the Earth, and it has a noticeably distinct color. The surface features of both planets also differ significantly. The Earth showcases a diverse array of features such as continents, oceans, and natural land formations. In contrast, Mars features a more barren and rugged terrain, with fewer distinguishing landmarks. The two planets have different atmospheric conditions, with Earth's atmosphere being rich and diverse, containing water, oxygen, and a variety of gases, while Mars' atmosphere is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide and much thinner, which can be attributed to the absence of a protective ozone layer.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nWhen comparing Earth and Mars based on their atmospheric conditions and surface features, several key differences and similarities emerge:\n\n### Atmospheric Conditions:\n\n**Earth:**\n- **Composition:** Primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases.\n- **Pressure:** Average atmospheric pressure is about 101.3 kPa at sea level.\n- **Temperature:** Average surface temperature is around 15°C (59°F), with a range influenced by weather systems.\n- **Weather:** Dynamic weather patterns, including rain, storms, and varying climates due to its water-rich atmosphere.\n\n**Mars:**\n- **Composition:** Mostly carbon dioxide (95.3%), with nitrogen and argon making up most of the remainder.\n- **Pressure:** Much lower atmospheric pressure, about 0.6 kPa, which is less than 1% of Earth's.\n- **Temperature:** Average surface temperature is about -63°C (-81°F), with significant variations between day and night.\n- **Weather:** Thin atmosphere leads to less dynamic weather; dust storms can occur but are less varied than Earth's weather systems.\n\n### Surface Features:\n\n**Earth:**\n- **Water:** Approximately 71% of the surface is covered by water, with oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n- **Landforms:** Diverse landscapes including mountains, forests, deserts, and plains, shaped by tectonic activity and erosion.\n- **Biodiversity:** Rich ecosystems support a wide variety of life forms.\n\n**Mars:**\n- **Water:** Evidence of past water flows; currently, water exists mainly as ice at the poles and possibly as brines.\n- **Landforms:** Features include the largest volcano (Olympus Mons), the deepest canyon (Valles Marineris), and vast plains of dust and sand.\n- **Biodiversity:** No known life forms; surface conditions are harsh and inhospitable.\n\n### Summary:\nEarth's atmosphere supports a diverse range of life and dynamic weather, while Mars has a thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere with extreme temperatures and limited weather phenomena. Surface features on Earth include abundant water and varied landscapes, whereas Mars features dry, rocky terrain with evidence of past water activity.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify Earth's robust, life-supporting atmosphere and contrast with Mars' thin CO2 atmosphere.\n2. Contrast Earth's continents, oceans and ice caps with Mar's dry and barren surface.",
