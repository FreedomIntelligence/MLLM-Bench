    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, assess the floor plan's design in terms of privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to the communal areas.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe floor plan presents a balanced approach to privacy for the bedrooms and accessibility to communal areas. Here’s an assessment:\n\n### Privacy for Bedrooms:\n1. **Location**: The bedrooms are situated on one side of the house, away from the communal areas (kitchen, dining, living), which enhances privacy.\n2. **Bathrooms**: Each bedroom has access to a nearby bathroom, reducing the need for guests or family members to traverse through private spaces.\n3. **Master Bedroom**: The master bedroom is slightly separated from the other bedrooms, providing additional privacy.\n\n### Accessibility to Communal Areas:\n1. **Open Layout**: The living, dining, and kitchen areas are centrally located, promoting easy movement and interaction among these spaces.\n2. **Proximity**: The layout ensures that communal areas are easily accessible from all bedrooms, allowing for convenient access without compromising privacy.\n3. **Prayer Room**: The prayer room is adjacent to the communal areas, providing a quiet space while remaining accessible.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Balance**: The design effectively balances privacy and accessibility, making it suitable for families or groups who value both.\n- **Flow**: The open flow between communal areas encourages social interaction while maintaining designated private spaces for rest and relaxation. \n\nThis design is functional and well-considered for both privacy and communal living.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the floor plan of a house displays a simple design with distinct bedrooms and other functional areas, such as a kitchen, living room, and dining room. Privacy in the bedrooms is ensured as they are separated into two different rooms, providing an appropriate level of seclusion for each occupant. The layout allows for easy access to the communal areas, which may include the dining room and living room, as they are relatively open and connected to the main living spaces. Moreover, the presence of a dining table in the living area promotes the convenience and accessibility of the space for everyday use. Overall, the floor plan appears to be designed in a way that offers comfortable and functional living spaces while maintaining privacy and easy accessibility for the occupants.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Evaluate if bedrooms are isolated from communal areas to ensure privacy.\n2. Assess ease of movement from bedrooms to communal spaces like kitchen and living.",
