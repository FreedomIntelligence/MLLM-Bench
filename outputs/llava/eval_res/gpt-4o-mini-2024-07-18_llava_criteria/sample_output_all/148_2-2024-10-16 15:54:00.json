    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain the humor in the image by identifying the elements that contribute to the joke. \n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe humor in the image primarily comes from the combination of the cat's posture and the text \"MONDAYS...\" Here are the key elements that contribute to the joke:\n\n1. **Cat's Posture**: The cat is curled up with its head resting on its paws, which gives the impression of frustration or defeat. This body language is relatable for many people who feel overwhelmed or tired, especially at the start of the week.\n\n2. **Text**: The word \"MONDAYS...\" is a common expression of dread or reluctance associated with the beginning of the work week. The ellipsis suggests a trailing off of thought, implying that the feeling is universally understood and perhaps even a bit dramatic.\n\n3. **Relatability**: Many people can relate to the idea of feeling sluggish or unmotivated on Mondays, making the image resonate with a wide audience. This connection enhances the humor.\n\n4. **Anthropomorphism**: By attributing human-like feelings of exhaustion or despair to the cat, the image becomes more humorous. It creates a playful scenario where a pet is expressing a very human emotion.\n\nOverall, the combination of the cat's expression and the text captures a common sentiment in a light-hearted way, making it both funny and relatable.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe humor in the image can be attributed to the cat sitting on a piece of pizza crust, making it look like the cat is sleeping on the pizza. This situation is a play on the common phrase \"Mondays are the worst,\" which is used to express a negative sentiment about the beginning of the week. The inclusion of the phrase \"Mondays . . .\" above the cat adds to the humor since it subtly implies that the cat is taking a nap on pizza crust on a Monday, making the situation seem amusing and relatable to viewers who may feel the same way about Mondays.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the cat's posture as resembling a person dreading Mondays.\n2. Explain the humor in anthropomorphizing the cat with human-like workweek blues.\n3. Relate the text \"MONDAYS...\" to the cat's defeated body language.",
