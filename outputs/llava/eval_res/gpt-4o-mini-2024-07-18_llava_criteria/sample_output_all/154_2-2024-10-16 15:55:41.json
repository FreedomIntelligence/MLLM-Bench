    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe in English the elements of discipline and ceremony visible at the event.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe event showcases a strong sense of discipline and ceremony, evident in the precision and uniformity of the marching soldiers. Dressed in striking red tunics and tall black bearskin hats, the guards exhibit a coordinated movement, reflecting rigorous training and attention to detail. The soldiers maintain a straight posture and synchronized steps, creating a visually impressive display.\n\nThe presence of a flag bearer adds to the ceremonial aspect, symbolizing tradition and national pride. The backdrop of Buckingham Palace enhances the grandeur of the event, reinforcing its historical significance. The gathered crowd, observing in silence, further emphasizes the respect and reverence associated with this formal occasion. Overall, the combination of military precision, traditional attire, and the iconic setting contributes to a powerful atmosphere of discipline and ceremony.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, a group of British soldiers, specifically Scottish soldiers, are performing a ceremonial march on a road next to a brick building, likely the palace. The soldiers are in uniform and showcase signs of discipline and ceremony. They are holding flags and playing instruments while marching in a neat and organized formation. This display of professionalism and pride in their uniforms and the synchronization of their movements during the ceremony are indicative of a well-trained and disciplined military unit. Such ceremonies often hold significant meaning or historical significance, serving as a display of honor, patriotism, and unity among the soldiers.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
