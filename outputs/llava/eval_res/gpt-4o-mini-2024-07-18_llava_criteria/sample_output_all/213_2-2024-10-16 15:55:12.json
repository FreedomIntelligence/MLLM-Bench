    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat is the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023 shown in the chart?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo find the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023 based on the chart:\n\n1. **April 2023**: Approximately 990\n2. **May 2023**: Approximately 1485\n3. **June 2023**: Approximately 1237\n4. **July 2023**: Approximately 742\n\nNow, add these values together:\n\n\\[ 990 + 1485 + 1237 + 742 = 3454 \\]\n\nNext, divide by the number of months (4):\n\n\\[ \\frac{3454}{4} \\approx 863.5 \\]\n\nSo, the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023 is about **864**.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart shows the number of meets in the last 12 months, but it also provides specific months such as April, May, and June. However, the chart does not average the number of meets across these months. Therefore, we cannot determine the approximate average number of meets from April 2023 to July 2023.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Recognize the approximate number of meetings for each month as: {\"April\": around 990, \"May\": around 1485, \"June\": around 1237, \"July\": between 742 and 990}.\n2. The result is the average of the recognized number of each month. An acceptable range for the final answer is 1100 ~ 1200.",
