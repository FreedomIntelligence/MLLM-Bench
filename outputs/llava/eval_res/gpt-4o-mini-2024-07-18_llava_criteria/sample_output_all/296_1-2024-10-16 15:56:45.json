    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease point out the most suitable location for an office space in the picture and provide a rationale for your choice.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is the small bedroom area with a black desk and chair. It has a computer monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse on the desk, which indicates that it is set up to be used as a workspace. The small bedroom setting provides a cozy and more personalized atmosphere compared to a dedicated office space away from the main living spaces. This location can be more suitable for people working from home or those running small businesses that require a dedicated workspace within their living area.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe most suitable location for an office space in the picture is at the desk against the wall with the window. \n\n### Rationale:\n1. **Natural Light**: The desk is positioned next to a window, allowing for ample natural light, which can enhance productivity and improve mood.\n\n2. **Ventilation**: Being near a window can also provide better ventilation, making the workspace more comfortable.\n\n3. **Organization**: The desk has built-in storage, which helps in keeping office supplies organized and within reach.\n\n4. **Quiet Corner**: This location appears to be more secluded from the rest of the room, potentially reducing distractions.\n\n5. **Aesthetics**: The view outside the window can create a pleasant atmosphere, making the workspace more inviting.\n\nOverall, this setup promotes a conducive working environment.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify desk as the most suitable location for an office space.\n2. Provide rationale related to functionality, such as lighting or space.",
