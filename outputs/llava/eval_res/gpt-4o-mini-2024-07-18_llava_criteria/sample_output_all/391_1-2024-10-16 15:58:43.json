    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInfer future automotive design evolution from current design trends.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nBy looking at the presidential automobiles showcased in the infographic, we can infer that there has been significant evolution in automotive design over the years. The early automobiles have been noticeably smaller and less refined, with simple interiors and fewer features. Over time, the design of these cars has evolved to be more sophisticated, incorporating advanced technologies, and larger, more comfortable interiors. This evolution can be attributed to advancements in automotive engineering, materials, and design aesthetics that aim to improve overall performance, durability, and luxury. As automotive design continues to progress, we can expect to see even more innovative styles, technologies, and features in future vehicles.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe evolution of automotive design, particularly in the context of presidential automobiles, reflects broader trends in technology, aesthetics, and societal values. Here are some key trends and potential future directions based on the current design trajectory:\n\n### 1. **Sustainability and Electric Vehicles**\n   - **Current Trend:** The inclusion of electric models like the 1912 Baker Electric highlights a shift towards more sustainable technologies.\n   - **Future Direction:** Expect a significant increase in electric and hybrid vehicles, with designs emphasizing energy efficiency, lightweight materials, and renewable resources.\n\n### 2. **Technological Integration**\n   - **Current Trend:** Modern vehicles increasingly feature advanced technology, including infotainment systems, driver assistance, and connectivity.\n   - **Future Direction:** Future designs will likely incorporate more autonomous features, smart connectivity, and advanced safety systems, making vehicles more interactive and user-friendly.\n\n### 3. **Luxury and Customization**\n   - **Current Trend:** Presidential cars have always been symbols of luxury, with bespoke designs and high-end materials.\n   - **Future Direction:** Customization options will expand, allowing for personalized interiors and exteriors that cater to individual tastes while maintaining luxurious standards.\n\n### 4. **Aerodynamic and Futuristic Aesthetics**\n   - **Current Trend:** Recent designs showcase smoother lines and aerodynamic shapes for efficiency and style.\n   - **Future Direction:** Expect a shift towards even more futuristic aesthetics, with sharp angles, innovative materials, and a focus on minimizing drag.\n\n### 5. **Safety and Security Features**\n   - **Current Trend:** Security has always been paramount in presidential vehicles, with reinforced structures and advanced security systems.\n   - **Future Direction:** Future designs will likely incorporate even more advanced security measures, including biometric access, drone surveillance, and enhanced armor.\n\n### 6. **Cultural and Historical Significance**\n   - **Current Trend:** Each presidential vehicle reflects the era's cultural and technological context.\n   - **Future Direction:** Future designs may draw inspiration from historical models while integrating modern elements, creating a blend of nostalgia and innovation.\n\n### 7. **Urban Mobility Solutions**\n   - **Current Trend:** As cities evolve, there's a growing focus on compact, efficient vehicles.\n   - **Future Direction:** Designs may shift towards smaller, multifunctional vehicles suitable for urban environments, incorporating features for shared mobility or micro-mobility solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe future of automotive design, especially for presidential vehicles, will likely blend sustainability, advanced technology, luxury, and security, reflecting the evolving needs and values of society. As these trends continue to develop, we can expect vehicles that are not only functional but also serve as symbols of progress and innovation.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify design trends from the historical vehicles shown in the image.\n2. Predict how these trends might evolve in future automotive designs.\n3. Answer must be specific to automotive design, not general transportation trends.",
