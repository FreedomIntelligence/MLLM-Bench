    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a caption that not only describes what is seen but also evokes the other senses, such as the smell of the fresh peaches or the taste of the jam, to create a multi-sensory experience.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a large woven basket filled with a variety of ripe peaches, placed beside a wooden table. Their colors range from vibrant reds to deep oranges, and they appear to be fresh and juicy. The basket, which seems to be handmade, lends a rustic charm to the scene. Next to the basket, there is a white ceramic jar filled with a sweet, homemade jam. The aroma of the peaches entices the senses, while the taste of the jam offers a delightful contrast to the freshness of the fruit. The combination of these elements creates a delightful and nostalgia-inducing experience that captures the essence of a sunny summer day spent outdoors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn this inviting still life, a basket brimming with sun-kissed peaches glistens with morning dew, their sweet, fragrant aroma wafting through the air, reminiscent of a warm summer day. Nearby, a jar of rich, amber peach jam sits patiently, its glossy surface reflecting the soft light, promising a taste that bursts with the essence of freshly picked fruit. The gentle crunch of a peach skin gives way to the juicy flesh, while the velvety sweetness of the jam dances on the tongue, evoking memories of lazy afternoons spent savoring the simple pleasures of life. The rustic wooden table beneath adds warmth, grounding this delightful scene in the heart of a cozy kitchen.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Caption includes visual description of peaches, jam jar, and setting.\n2. Caption evokes sense of smell (e.g., fresh peaches) and taste (e.g., sweet jam).\n3. Caption is coherent, creates a multi-sensory experience, and aligns with the image.",
