    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf I intend to pack a sandwich of the dimensions matching a grown man's hand, which container from the picture should I select?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo pack a sandwich that matches the dimensions of a grown man's hand, you should select a container that is flat and wide enough to accommodate the size of the sandwich comfortably. Based on the image, a flat container or plate would be the most suitable option.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image and considering the size of a grown man's hand, I would recommend using the largest cup available. It is located towards the right side of the image and seems to be a good fit for the sandwich. However, it is important to keep in mind that cups are typically designed for beverages and not for housing food items like a sandwich. Therefore, you might need to use a more suitable container or wrap the sandwich securely before placing it in the cup.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify container size suitable for a grown man's hand-sized sandwich.\n2. Justify container choice based on dimensions and shape.",
