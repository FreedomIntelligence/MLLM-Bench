    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend to be represented in such a graph and predict what the next stage will be?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe graph represents the evolution of humans from primates to modern humans. The image depicts several stages of human evolution, starting with a monkey, followed by a primitive human, a caveman, and finally a modern man. Each of these stages is shown holding a tool, like a weapon or a tool for digging, which reflects the progress in cognitive and physical abilities that humans have undergone throughout their evolution.\n\nBased on this graph, it is plausible that the next stage in the evolution of humans will be characterized by enhancements and advancements in technology or communication, such as the invention of writing, advanced tools, and the development of complex societies. This is evident from the increasing complexity of the tools and weapons held by each stage, reflecting the development of humans' intelligence, social structure, and communication capabilities.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe graph illustrates a progression of human evolution, showcasing a transition from primitive beings to modern humans. This trend reflects advancements in physical development, tool use, and social interaction over time.\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n1. **Evolutionary Stages:** The figures depict a clear evolution from a crouched, primitive form to a more upright, modern human posture.\n2. **Tool Development:** The progression includes the use of increasingly sophisticated tools, indicating advancements in technology and problem-solving.\n3. **Social Interaction:** The final figure represents a modern individual engaged with technology, suggesting a shift in social dynamics and communication methods.\n\n**Predictions for the Next Stage:**\nThe next stage could involve further integration of technology into daily life, possibly emphasizing virtual or augmented reality interactions, advanced AI integration, or even bioengineering enhancements. This may lead to new forms of communication and social structures, reflecting an ongoing evolution in human experience and capabilities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the evolution trend depicted in the image.\n2. Predict the next stage in the sequence, maintaining logical consistency.\n3. Ensure prediction aligns with technological or societal advancements.",
