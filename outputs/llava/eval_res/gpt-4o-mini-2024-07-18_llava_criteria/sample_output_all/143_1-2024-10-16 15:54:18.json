    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the elements of the cowâ€™s expression and pose that lend this image a comedic effect.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe comedic element in the image is the cow's pose and facial expression, which appears to resemble a person sticking out their tongue. This gives the impression of the cow playfully licking its nose or sticking its tongue out, creating a light-hearted and amusing effect. Additionally, the cow is standing in a grassy field, which contributes to its casual and relaxed demeanor in the scene.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe comedic effect in the cow's expression and pose can be attributed to several elements:\n\n1. **Close-up Perspective**: The image is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the cow's face, particularly its large nose and tongue, which creates a humorous, exaggerated effect.\n\n2. **Tongue Out**: The cow's tongue sticking out can evoke a playful or silly demeanor, often associated with light-heartedness in animals.\n\n3. **Facial Expression**: The cow's eyes and the way its mouth is positioned can suggest curiosity or a goofy expression, enhancing the comedic aspect.\n\n4. **Background Context**: The blurred background of other cows and greenery adds to the scene without distracting from the main subject, making the cow's antics stand out.\n\n5. **Natural Setting**: The relaxed rural environment contrasts with the cow's playful pose, creating a humorous juxtaposition between the serene setting and the cow's silly behavior. \n\nThese elements combine to create a lighthearted and amusing portrayal of the cow.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify exaggerated facial features: tongue out, close-up angle, wet nose.\n2. Note the cow's playful, intrusive pose into camera space.\n3. Mention the humorous human-like expression of curiosity or mischief.",
