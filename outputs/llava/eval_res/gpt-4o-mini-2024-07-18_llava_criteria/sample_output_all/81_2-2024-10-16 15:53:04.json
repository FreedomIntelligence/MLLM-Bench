    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nwhat are the cooking methods that turn the food in the image from ingredients to dishes?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe cooking methods that likely transform the ingredients in the image into dishes include:\n\n1. **Frying**: Many items, such as the skewers and fritters, are likely deep-fried to achieve a crispy texture and golden color.\n\n2. **Grilling**: The skewered meats may be grilled, which adds flavor through char and smoke.\n\n3. **Baking or Steaming**: The buns might be steamed or baked to achieve a soft texture.\n\n4. **Sautéing**: Ingredients could be sautéed to develop flavors before being assembled into dishes.\n\n5. **Assembling**: Combining cooked ingredients into the buns to create sandwiches or other dishes.\n\nThese methods work together to create flavorful and appealing street food dishes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the food is being prepared through a combination of grilling and roasting methods. The sandwiches and meats are placed on a grill, and it appears that they are being cooked or grilled to achieve the right texture, browning, and flavor. The cooking process involves high heat from the grill, which causes the surfaces of the food to cook evenly, creating a desirable crust and enhancing their overall taste. Additionally, there are water bottles in the scene, suggesting that they may be used to keep the grill clean, cool, and hydrated during the cooking process.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible foods: fried chicken, grilled skewers, stuffed sandwiches.\n2. Describe the cooking methods for these foods and transformation from raw ingredients to the final dish.\n3. Mention the use of heat and any visible seasoning or coating.",
