    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPredict which watch characteristics will dominate in the next decade.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the next decade, several watch characteristics are likely to dominate based on current trends and technological advancements:\n\n1. **Sustainability**: Eco-friendly materials and sustainable manufacturing practices will become increasingly important, driven by consumer demand for environmentally responsible products.\n\n2. **Smart Features**: The integration of smart technology, such as health monitoring and connectivity features, will continue to evolve, appealing to tech-savvy consumers.\n\n3. **Durability and Functionality**: Robust designs with high water resistance and shock resistance will remain popular, especially for outdoor and sports watches.\n\n4. **Customization**: Personalized options, including interchangeable straps and customizable dials, will attract consumers looking for unique pieces.\n\n5. **Vintage Aesthetics**: The retro trend in watch design will persist, with brands revisiting classic styles and incorporating modern technology.\n\n6. **Hybrid Movements**: A blend of traditional mechanical movements with modern quartz or smart technology will gain traction, offering the best of both worlds.\n\n7. **Minimalist Design**: Clean, simple designs with fewer complications will appeal to a broader audience, focusing on elegance and functionality.\n\n8. **Heritage and Storytelling**: Brands will emphasize their history and craftsmanship, creating narratives that resonate with consumers seeking authenticity.\n\nThese trends reflect a blend of innovation, sustainability, and consumer preferences that will shape the future of watchmaking.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, which features a timeline of various tuna types, it is difficult to predict which watch characteristics will dominate the next decade. However, since the timeline represents different types of tuna and their developments, it is more likely to focus on the evolution of tuna species or their attributes, such as size, taste, and health benefits. Therefore, the expected trend would be to promote healthier and more sustainably sourced tuna options rather than focusing on watch features or characteristics that do not relate to the primary subject of the timeline.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify historical trends in watch features from the timeline.\n2. Predict future trends in materials, technology, or design elements.\n3. Answer must be plausible and reflect evolution from past to future.",
