    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the structural remnants and damage pattern in the image, deduce the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nFrom the image, it can be inferred that the disaster has caused significant damage to the buildings and infrastructure. The presence of a large group of rescue workers in blue work outfits indicates a well-organized and coordinated response to the disaster. The fact that many people are working together and wearing matching outfits suggests that they have been there for some time and are likely dealing with a substantial damage situation. The presence of several people with shovels working on the debris also supports the idea that the cleanup is underway and will be a long-term effort. The overall context and visual evidence from the image suggest that the disaster has been intense and its duration is likely significant, requiring a substantial cleanup and recovery effort.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nI'm unable to analyze images directly. However, I can help you understand how to deduce the duration and intensity of a disaster based on structural remnants and damage patterns.\n\n1. **Damage Extent**: Look for the level of destruction in buildings. Complete collapses indicate a high-intensity event, while minor damage suggests a lower intensity.\n\n2. **Debris Distribution**: A wide spread of debris can indicate a longer duration or more powerful event, while concentrated debris may suggest a more localized impact.\n\n3. **Structural Integrity**: Analyze how buildings are damaged. Severe structural failures (e.g., walls buckled, roofs collapsed) indicate significant force, while superficial damage suggests lower intensity.\n\n4. **Response Teams**: The presence and organization of response teams can indicate the scale of the disaster. A large number of responders usually suggests a serious event requiring extensive recovery efforts.\n\n5. **Environmental Impact**: Look for signs of landslides, flooding, or other environmental factors that can provide clues about the disaster's nature and severity.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can make informed deductions about the disaster's duration and intensity.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify key structural damage and debris distribution to infer disaster intensity.\n2. Assess damage to buildings and surroundings for estimating disaster duration.\n3. Exclude rescue team presence as an indicator of duration or intensity.",
