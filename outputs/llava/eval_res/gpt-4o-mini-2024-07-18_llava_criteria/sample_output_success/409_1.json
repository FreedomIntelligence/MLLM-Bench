    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the human movement and environment in the picture detailedly.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, a person is skillfully riding a bicycle down a rocky, dirt hillside.

The rider displays impressive balance and control as they navigate through the challenging landscape. This captivating scene showcases the adventurous aspect of mountain biking and the rider's ability to adapt to unpredictable, rocky terrain.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe scene captures an exhilarating moment of a mountain biker navigating a rugged, rocky terrain. The biker is positioned on the edge of a steep cliff, showcasing a dynamic posture as they lean forward, suggesting speed and control. The bright orange shorts contrast sharply with the earthy tones of the landscape, adding a vibrant touch to the image.\n\nDust is kicked up from the ground, highlighting the intensity of the ride as the bike’s tires grip the rocky surface. The surrounding environment features dramatic geological formations, with layered cliffs and deep canyons that emphasize the rugged beauty of the landscape. The sunlight casts sharp shadows, creating a sense of depth and highlighting the textures of the rocks.\n\nIn the background, the expansive view of the canyon stretches out, with ridges and valleys that seem to go on indefinitely, contributing to the feeling of adventure and the thrill of outdoor sports.
