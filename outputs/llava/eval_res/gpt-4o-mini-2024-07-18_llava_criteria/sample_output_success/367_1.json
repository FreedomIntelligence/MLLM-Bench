    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIf one of the person in the image wants to post this picture on social media, please help write an small article which narrates the entire scene from his/her perspective and include their sensory experiences - what they see, hear, smell, and feel - as well as their inner thoughts and emotions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nAs I stand on the beach with my family and friends, our hands entwined in a chain, I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and happiness. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow on the waves, and the sky is adorned with clouds that add to the picturesque scene. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore and the gentle sea breeze create a calming atmosphere. The smell of the saltwater and the cool sand beneath my feet remind me of the carefree days of childhood spent on the beach.\n\nAs I look at the people around me - our family and friends, young and old, I feel a sense of togetherness and gratitude. This moment captured, with the backdrop of a beautiful sunset, is a memory that will be cherished for years to come. It is a reminder of the importance of spending quality time with loved ones, enjoying the simple pleasures of life, and appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\n\nWith my cellphone in hand, I snap a photo to capture this precious memory. The image not only shows the chain of people on the beach but also the vibrant colors of the sunset and the ocean waves. I share it on social media, along with a caption that expresses my emotions and thoughts about this beautiful moment. The picture spreads joy, and many people like and share it, highlighting the significance of such moments in our lives.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\n**A Sunset to Remember**\n\nAs I stand on the soft, warm sand, the gentle waves lap at my feet, sending a refreshing chill that contrasts with the fading warmth of the sun. The sky is painted in shades of orange, pink, and purple, a breathtaking canvas that seems almost unreal. I take a deep breath, inhaling the salty sea air mixed with the faint scent of sunscreen and the sweet aroma of nearby snacks. \n\nAround me, my family stands hand in hand, a beautiful tapestry of love and connection. I glance at their silhouettes against the vibrant sunset, each figure a reminder of shared laughter and cherished memories. The sound of laughter fills the air, mingling with the rhythmic crash of the waves, creating a symphony of joy that resonates within me.\n\nAs I look out at the horizon, I feel a surge of gratitude. This moment, this scene, is a snapshot of happiness that I want to hold onto forever. The warmth of my loved ones beside me brings a sense of belonging, a feeling that no matter where life takes us, we are anchored together in these precious moments.\n\nI close my eyes for a moment, letting the sounds and scents wash over me. The gentle breeze brushes against my skin, a soft caress that whispers promises of future adventures. I can’t help but smile, knowing that this isn’t just a sunset; it’s a celebration of our bond, a reminder of the beauty found in togetherness.\n\nAs the sun dips lower, casting its final golden rays, I feel a rush of emotions—love, nostalgia, and hope. I can’t wait to share this moment on social media, to capture the essence of this evening and let others feel the warmth of our togetherness. This sunset isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a symbol of everything we hold dear.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
