    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the upper side and lower side and find 5 differences in the picture\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the upper side of the image, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones, whereas in the lower side, there are three people sitting around a table with laptops and cell phones. However, the differences between the two images include the poses of the people and the layout of the table. The people in the upper image are in different poses and are not all in the same positions as in the lower image. There is also a bottle visible in both images, but its placement on the table is different. Additionally, the presence of a dining table and chairs is common to both images, but the design or style of the table and chairs may differ.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are five differences between the two images:\n\n1. The hair color of the girl with pigtails is different; it's darker in the top image.\n2. The drink in front of the girl in the orange dress is a different color in each image.\n3. The guy on the left has a different posture in the two images.\n4. The laptop on the table has a different logo in the two images.\n5. The footwear of the character on the right is a different color in each image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
