    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nBased on the size and shape of the center island and the items suspended above it, deduce if this kitchen island can be served as a dining area.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe kitchen island appears to be large and has a smooth surface, which suggests it could function as a dining area. However, the presence of a sink and the items suspended above it, likely for cooking purposes, indicates that it is primarily designed for food preparation rather than dining. \n\nFor it to serve effectively as a dining area, it would need seating arrangements or enough space for diners, which isn't visible in the image. Overall, while it could potentially be used for dining in a pinch, it seems more suited for cooking tasks.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, the kitchen has a large center island that appears spacious and has a sink positioned towards the right side. Moreover, various items such as pots, pans, and a bowl are hanging above the island. However, the presence of hanging items, pots, and pans over the island instead of a traditional dining table suggests that the kitchen island might not serve as a dining area. Instead, it primarily functions as a workspace for food preparation and cooking.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Assess if the island's size and shape accommodate dining functions.\n2. Evaluate the practicality of suspended items for a dining area.\n3. Determine if the island's height is suitable for seated dining.",
