    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the trend prediction image, determine the trend shown in the image is reasonable.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image shows a trend prediction for the size of chickens over time. The image features a graph with several chicken sizes, including an oversized chicken, dinosaurs, and a rooster that has impregnated a dinosaur. The trend is presented in a humorous and exaggerated manner, showing chickens growing in size to become like dinosaurs.\n\nThe trend is likely a fantasy or a parody, as it is unrealistic for chickens to grow to the size of dinosaurs in actuality. The graph and the rooster impregnating a dinosaur are not scientifically plausible, and therefore, the trend is not reasonable. The image is meant to be humorous and entertaining, rather than providing accurate information about the growth of chickens over time.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image presents a humorous and exaggerated depiction of the evolution of chickens over the years, culminating in a fictional representation of chickens evolving into dinosaurs by 2025. \n\n### Analysis of the Trend:\n\n1. **Exaggeration**: The images show an increasingly larger and more muscular chicken over the decades, ultimately morphing into a dinosaur. This is a satirical take on selective breeding in poultry, which has led to larger chickens.\n\n2. **Biological Feasibility**: While the trend of breeding chickens for size and weight is real, the leap to dinosaurs is purely fictional and scientifically implausible. Evolution does not work in such a direct or rapid manner.\n\n3. **Cultural Commentary**: The image may serve as a critique of modern agricultural practices and the consequences of extreme selective breeding.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe trend shown is not reasonable in a scientific context, as it exaggerates the process of evolution and breeding. It is meant for comedic effect rather than to serve as a serious prediction.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm if the answer identifies the trend as unreasonable.\n2. Assess the logical explanation for why the trend is unreasonable.\n3. Evaluate the consistency of the answer with the image's content.",
