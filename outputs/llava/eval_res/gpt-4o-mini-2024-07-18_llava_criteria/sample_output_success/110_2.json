    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease interpret the facial expressions and body language of the subjects, providing insights into their possible emotions or roles in the context of the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, the subjects are dressed in traditional attire, which suggests a cultural or ceremonial context. The central figure, seated at the table, appears to exude a sense of authority or leadership, indicated by their posture and the way they are positioned. Their hands resting on the table convey confidence and a welcoming demeanor, while the slight forward lean may suggest engagement or readiness to interact.\n\nThe two figures standing on either side of the seated individual seem to adopt supportive roles. Their postures are upright and attentive, with one individual slightly turned towards the central figure, indicating a connection or alignment with their authority. Their expressions, though not visible, can be inferred to reflect respect or admiration, given their positions and attire.\n\nOverall, the body language of the subjects suggests a formal gathering, possibly for a significant event or discussion, where the seated figure holds a central, commanding role, while the others provide support and solidarity.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, there are three men dressed in traditional Asian attire, likely Chinese. One of the men is sitting on a throne-like chair with a large moon above him, while the other two men stand on either side of him. All three men appear to be wearing funny hats, which might indicate that they are participating in a cultural performance, ceremony, or a festive event.\n\nThe man sitting on the chair seems to be in a position of authority or importance, possibly as the leader, judge, or central figure in the event. The two men standing by his side seem to be his assistants, advisers, or possibly competitors in a contest. Their facial expressions are serious, which further emphasizes the importance of their roles in the context of the image. Overall, the scene seems to depict a formal, organized, and culturally significant event involving these three men.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if smiles are present on subjects' faces, indicating happiness or friendliness.\n2. Describe subjects' body language to suggest their confidence or comfort level.\n3. Assess the context to infer subjects' possible roles or social dynamics.\n",
