    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze how the visual metaphor in the right image exaggerates the challenge of the situation depicted in the left image and why this hyperbole is humorous.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe visual metaphor in the right image dramatically exaggerates the challenge of caring for a baby by depicting the situation as if the caregiver is handling a bomb instead of a sleeping child. This hyperbole highlights the intense pressure and anxiety that can accompany parenting, especially for new parents who may feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe humor arises from the absurdity of comparing a peaceful moment, like putting a baby to sleep, to a high-stakes scenario involving explosives. This juxtaposition creates a comedic effect, as it transforms an everyday task into a life-or-death situation, amplifying the stress in a playful way. The exaggerated imagery allows viewers to relate to the feelings of anxiety while also finding amusement in the exaggerated comparison.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the right image, a toy gun is placed on the baby lying on the bed, while the left image shows the baby sleeping peacefully without any danger. The visual metaphor in the right image exaggerates the challenge of the situation by presenting an exaggerately harmful item, the toy gun, which suggests a level of danger that is far from the actual situation depicted in the left image. This hyperbole is humorous as it creates a contrast between the calm and peaceful scenario in the left image and the imaginary, exaggerated dangers in the right image. This contrast emphasizes the fact that the baby's situation in the left image is benign and not a cause for concern, while the right image uses over-the-top elements to create humor by juxtaposing two vastly different scenarios in a single image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the contrast between the normal task (left) and its exaggerated version (right) as a metaphor for difficulty.\n2. Explain why the exaggeration (dynamite as a diaper) creates humor in the context of the challenge.\n3. Assess the effectiveness of the visual metaphor in conveying the hyperbolic sense of challenge.",
