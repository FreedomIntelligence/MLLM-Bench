Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the exercise in the image and briefly introduce the technical essentials of this excercise.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a man performing a weighted bench press, which is a strength training exercise. The man is lifting a weight (barbell) above his head and lowering it behind his chest, pressing it down and then pushing it up again, working on his upper body muscles. The technical essentials of the bench press include maintaining proper form, engaging the correct muscle groups, and lifting the weight with a controlled motion, while keeping the focus on safety and avoiding excess strain on the body.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe exercise depicted in the image is the **bench press**. \n\n### Technical Essentials of the Bench Press:\n\n1. **Setup**: Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Lower the barbell to your chest, ensuring your elbows are at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Keep your wrists straight and aligned with your forearms.\n\n3. **Execution**: Press the barbell upward until your arms are fully extended. Engage your core throughout the movement to maintain stability.\n\n4. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the barbell and exhale as you press it back up.\n\n5. **Safety**: Use a spotter or safety bars if lifting heavy weights to prevent injury. Always ensure the weights are securely fastened.\n\nThis exercise primarily targets the pectoral muscles, shoulders, and triceps, making it a fundamental movement for upper body strength training.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the exercise as \"bench press.\"\n2. Briefly describe the technical essentials of bench press including lowering and pressing up a weight, breathing techniques etc.",
