    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyzing the pairwise relationships between all characters in the diagram.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are several characters interacting with each other, each holding a different animal mask. Here’s an analysis of the pairwise relationships:\n\n1. **Child on the left and the adult in the center**: The child appears to be leaning towards the adult, suggesting a close relationship, possibly familial. The child is engaged in the fun by holding a mask and seems to look up to the adult.\n\n2. **Adult in the center and the child on the right**: The adult is positioned between the two children, indicating a protective or guiding role. The child on the right is holding a mask and is likely enjoying the moment, reinforcing a playful atmosphere.\n\n3. **Child on the left and child on the right**: The two children are positioned closely together, which suggests camaraderie and shared enjoyment. They both hold masks that contribute to the festive mood, indicating they are likely friends or siblings.\n\nOverall, the relationships depicted are characterized by playfulness, support, and familial or friendly bonds, enhanced by the festive setting and props they are using.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image, three people are standing together, possibly celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. The woman and two kids are holding up cow-shaped and possibly horse-shaped hats, which could be part of a party theme or decoration. The pairwise relationships between the characters are as follows:\n\n1. The woman is standing in the middle.\n2. The two kids are on either side of her, with one on her left and the other on her right.\n\nThese three people create a cohesive group, likely enjoying a fun and memorable event together.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the relationship in a pairwise fashion.\n2. Use social cues like body language, attire, and props for reasoning.\n3. Avoid definitive statements of the relationships.",
