    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease carefully examine the design of the bed and inform me of all its possible uses.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe bed design in the image appears to have several potential uses:\n\n1. **Sleeping**: The primary function of the bed is for sleeping and resting, providing comfort with its cushioned surface.\n\n2. **Reading or Relaxing**: The design allows for comfortable seating, making it suitable for reading, relaxing, or enjoying leisure time.\n\n3. **Decorative Element**: The bed's aesthetic contributes to the overall decor of the room, enhancing the visual appeal and style.\n\n4. **Multi-functional Space**: Depending on its height and design, the bed could also serve as a low seating area or a space for meditation.\n\n5. **Storage Option**: If the bed has built-in storage (not visible in the image), it could be used to store bedding, clothes, or other items.\n\n6. **Social Space**: The bed could serve as a casual gathering spot for conversations or activities, especially in a larger room.\n\n7. **Workspace**: In a pinch, it could be used as a workspace for light tasks, especially if paired with a lap desk or similar setup.\n\nOverall, the bed's design promotes versatility beyond just sleeping, making it a key feature in the room's functionality.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe bed in this image is an oddly shaped or square design made of wood and white. It features multiple pillows, giving it a cozy and comfortable appearance. Additionally, there are two benches in the room, one located near the foot of the bed and the other placed farther away. The room also contains other decorative elements, such as two vases situated on the floor.\n\nThis unique bed design, combined with the presence of benches, suggests that the room may serve multiple purposes other than just a bedroom. The benches can be used as seating for activities such as reading, watching television, or even as a place for guests to sit while conversing. The room could be a versatile space where guests can relax, socialize, or even work on a laptop or perform other tasks while enjoying the comfortable and inviting atmosphere created by the bed and benches.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify primary function of the bed (e.g., sleeping/resting) based on design.\n2. List additional functions (e.g., storage, seating) suggested by bed features.",
