    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nAnalyze the possible emotional dynamics of the coupleâ€™s interaction based on their seating posture and orientation towards each other.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe couple's interaction suggests a playful and affectionate dynamic. The woman is positioned behind the man, which often indicates a sense of closeness and comfort. This posture can imply trust, as she is in a position that requires vulnerability. Her arms wrapped around him further emphasize intimacy and connection.\n\nThe flower she holds adds a romantic touch, suggesting that the moment is special or celebratory. The man's relaxed posture, with her arms around him, indicates that he is comfortable and receptive to her presence. Overall, their body language reflects a strong emotional bond characterized by warmth and joy.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the man is holding the woman in his arms while she is smiling. The woman is sitting on the man's shoulders with pink flowers in her hand. The couple's interaction suggests a sense of joy, closeness, and affection between them. Their seating posture and orientation towards each other indicate a playful and intimate connection, possibly indicating that they are enjoying a special moment together, such as a romantic outing, a celebration, or simply spending quality time with one another. The presence of pink flowers adds a touch of warmth, love, and happiness to the scene, further emphasizing the positive emotions and bond between the couple.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
