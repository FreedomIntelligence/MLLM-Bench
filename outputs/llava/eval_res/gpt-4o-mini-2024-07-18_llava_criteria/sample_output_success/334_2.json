    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nInspect the damage of the racquet and give some suggestion to repair it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIt looks like the racquet has some damage, particularly around the handle area where the grip appears to be frayed or coming off. Here are some suggestions for repair:\n\n1. **Replace the Grip**: \n   - Remove the old grip by peeling it off carefully.\n   - Clean the handle surface to remove any adhesive residue.\n   - Purchase a new grip tape that suits your preference (thickness, texture).\n   - Wrap the new grip tape around the handle, ensuring it overlaps slightly for better cushioning.\n\n2. **Reinforce the Handle**:\n   - If the handle is structurally compromised, consider using a small amount of epoxy or strong adhesive to reinforce it before applying the new grip.\n   - Make sure the adhesive is suitable for the materials of the racquet.\n\n3. **Check for Other Damage**:\n   - Inspect the shaft and head for any cracks or breaks. If there are significant structural issues, it might be worth consulting a professional for repair or considering a replacement.\n\n4. **Regular Maintenance**:\n   - After repairs, maintain the racquet by storing it properly and avoiding extreme temperatures to prolong its lifespan.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to restore the racquet to a playable condition.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe racquet in the image is broken, with the strings exposed and a piece missing from the handle. To repair the racquet, one should replace the broken string with a new one, ensuring the correct size and tension. Since the racquet is exposed to the elements, it is essential to check for any damage to the frame, such as cracks or bends, and address them appropriately. If the frame is damaged, consulting a professional or a tennis store might be necessary to examine and repair the frame. It is also a good idea to replace the handle with a new one to ensure proper grip and safety. Regular maintenance and inspection of the racquet can prevent future damage and improve performance.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the grip is broken and irreparable; answer: change the grip.\n2. Evaluate the extent of racquet damage beyond the grip.\n3. Suggest repair solutions, prioritizing grip replacement.",
