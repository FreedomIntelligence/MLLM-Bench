    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the sentiment expressed in the interaction between the two foxes, taking into account the use of brushstrokes and color choice to convey emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe interaction between the two foxes, with one kissing or rubbing its nose against the other's, conveys a sense of affection, love, and closeness.

The soft lines and watercolor style of the painting further emphasize the gentle and intimate nature of their interaction. In this image, the artist effectively uses the visual elements to create a sense of emotion and convey the depth of the relationship between the two foxes.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe interaction between the two foxes in the artwork conveys a strong sense of affection and tenderness. The use of warm colors, primarily shades of orange and yellow, evokes feelings of warmth, joy, and intimacy. \n\nThe brushstrokes are soft and fluid, enhancing the gentle nature of their interaction.
