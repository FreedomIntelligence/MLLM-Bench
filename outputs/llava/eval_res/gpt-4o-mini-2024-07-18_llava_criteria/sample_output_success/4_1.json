    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the objects in the image and determine the functionality of each socket.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there is a small box with several sockets displayed on it. One socket appears to be a USB plug, which can be used for charging or connecting devices like smartphones or external hard drives to a computer. Another socket is a microSD card slot, which is designed to provide a secure and convenient method for storing and accessing data on a removable, high-capacity memory card. A third socket is a headphone jack, which typically allows for the connection of headphones or speakers to a device for audio output, with the ability to play or listen to sound without disturbing others.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image depicts a compact device, likely a docking station or hub, with various ports and functionalities. Here’s a breakdown of the identified objects and their functionalities:\n\n1. **USB Ports (2)**: \n   - **Functionality**: Used for connecting peripherals such as keyboards, mice, or external storage devices. They may also support data transfer and charging.\n\n2. **USB-C Port**: \n   - **Functionality**: This port can be used for data transfer, charging devices, or connecting to displays. It often supports faster data rates and power delivery.\n\n3. **Audio Jack**: \n   - **Functionality**: Used for connecting headphones or speakers for audio output.\n\n4. **SD Card Slot**: \n   - **Functionality**: Allows for the insertion of an SD card, enabling data transfer from cameras or additional storage.\n\n5. **Power Button**: \n   - **Functionality**: Used to turn the device on or off.\n\n6. **LED Indicators**: \n   - **Functionality**: Provide visual feedback on the device's status, such as power on/off or data transfer activity.\n\nThis device likely serves as a multifunctional hub, enhancing connectivity for laptops or tablets, such as the iPad shown in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly identify the object as a docking station.\n2. Accurately list all visible sockets: USB ports, Type-C port, Microphone Jack, SD Card Slot.\n3. Describe the functionality for each identified socket.",
