    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the authenticity of the badge by comparing its design elements with standard badges from the specified region (e.g., Mayberry), including text font and arrangement, symbols, and material appearance.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo assess the authenticity of the badge, consider the following design elements:\n\n1. **Shape and Structure**: Authentic badges typically have a specific shape and structure. The star shape with a central circle and additional decorative elements is common in sheriff badges.\n\n2. **Text Font and Arrangement**: Examine the font style used for \"SHERIFF\" and \"MAYBERRY.\" Authentic badges usually have a consistent font that matches official designs. The arrangement of text should also follow standard formats, often with \"SHERIFF\" prominently displayed at the top.\n\n3. **Symbols**: The presence of a star symbol in the center and any additional insignia or decorative elements should be compared with known authentic badges from Mayberry or similar regions.\n\n4. **Material Appearance**: Authentic badges are often made from specific metals or materials that give them a certain weight and sheen. Look for signs of quality craftsmanship, such as engraving details and finish.\n\n5. **Color and Finish**: The color (usually silver or gold) and finish (polished or brushed) should align with known examples. Authentic badges usually have a consistent finish that reflects their official status.\n\n6. **Overall Quality**: Inspect the badge for any signs of wear, manufacturing defects, or inconsistencies that might indicate it is a replica rather than an authentic piece.\n\nBy comparing these elements with verified examples of Mayberry sheriff badges, you can determine the authenticity of the badge in question.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the badge appears to be a Sheriff badge from the Mayberry region. The badge is shiny, possibly made of metal, and it has a star symbol on it, which is a common feature in law enforcement badges. The text \"Sheriff Mayberry\" is written on the badge, indicating that it is specifically from the Mayberry region. However, without more detailed information or a point of reference, it is challenging to determine the authenticity of the badge.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Verify the badge as a prop.\n2. Provide evidence showing the badge is a prop, such as text font, symbols and arrangement.",
