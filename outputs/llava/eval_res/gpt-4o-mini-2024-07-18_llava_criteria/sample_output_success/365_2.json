Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCraft a narrative poem on political activism's fervor and the spectrum of public opinion in cityscape demonstrations.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the heart of the city, where the streets converge,  \nVoices rise like thunder, a fervent surge.  \nBanners wave high, colors bold and bright,  \nA tapestry woven of hope and fight.  \n\n“Stop!” they cry, with passion ablaze,  \nEach word a spark in the smoky haze.  \nFrom young hands reaching, to elders’ wise eyes,  \nA spectrum of voices beneath the gray skies.  \n\nThe rhythm of footsteps, a march in unison,  \nEchoes of anger, of love, of vision.  \nEach face a story, each sign a plea,  \nIn the dance of dissent, they seek to be free.  \n\nYet shadows linger where opinions collide,  \nSome cheer in support, while others deride.  \nThe cityscape pulses with fervor and fear,  \nIn the clash of ideals, the truth feels unclear.  \n\n“Change is our anthem!” the crowd chants loud,  \nWhile whispers of doubt loom beneath the crowd.  \nIn this vibrant mosaic of voices and dreams,  \nHope intertwines with the tear of seams.  \n\nAs the sun dips low, casting long shadows,  \nThe city breathes life into the fervor that grows.  \nIn unity fractured, yet strong in its plight,  \nThey gather together, igniting the night.  \n\nFor in this moment, the world holds its breath,  \nIn the heart of the struggle, they dance with death.  \nYet still they rise, with courage to stand,  \nIn the city of dreams, united they band.  \n\nSo let the banners fly, let the voices resound,  \nIn the pulse of the city, true change can be found.  \nFor every heartbeat echoes a call to be heard,  \nIn the fervor of activism, they rise undeterred.  \n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the heart of the city, on a bustling street,\nA crowd gathered, with protesters in retreat.\nTheir fervor for change, their voices united,\nIn the name of justice, they stood all conspired.\n\nOn the corner of a downtown intersection,\nA Trump placard waved with strong affliction.\nAmidst the crowd, a man raised his hand,\nWith the sign, he stood as a bold champion.\n\nIn the image, some with Trump placards in hand,\nOthers with signs, voicing their dissent.\nA diverse group of people, opinions vast,\nIn the city landscape, their voices never past.\n\nThe intersection became a platform for the clash,\nA space for voices that couldn't be rushed.\nWith traffic lights above, the scene unfolded,\nA reflection of the nation's deeply rooted.\n\nVarious viewpoints, perspectives, and beliefs,\nThe city's vibrant colors, a canvas for griefs.\nThe people's voices, like a symphony,\nEchoing throughout the bustling reality.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem includes city demonstration with a \"STOP TRUMP\" sign, reflecting political activism.\n2. Narrative captures the fervor of activism and spectrum of public opinion.\n3.
