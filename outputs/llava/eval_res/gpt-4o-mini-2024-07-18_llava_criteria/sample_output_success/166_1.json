    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDetermine the main point of the headline and use external knowledge to explain the broader context of the event or issue discussed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe main point of the headline is that two anti-Israel activists are ripping down a poster, which sparks a discussion about the reasons for their actions and the reactions to it. The headline also refers to the activists as \"not a shred of decency,\" suggesting a negative opinion about their behavior.\n\nIn the image, there are two people, and one of them appears to be a female activist tearing down a sign. It is not clear what the content of the sign is, but it seems to be related to the anti-Israel movement or actions. The phrase \"not a shred of decency\" implies that the behavior of the activists is considered unethical or disrespectful by the creator of the headline. This could signify a disagreement about the methods being used to express protest or activism.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe main point of the headline is to criticize anti-Israel activists for their actions of tearing down hostage posters, framing these acts as lacking decency and compassion. \n\nThe broader context involves heightened tensions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly following recent escalations in violence. Since the Hamas attacks in October 2023, there has been a surge in both pro-Israel and anti-Israel sentiments globally. This has led to protests, counter-protests, and an increase in incidents of vandalism and hate speech. The tearing down of hostage posters is seen as part of a larger pattern of hostility against Jewish communities and support for Hamas, which has made alarming statements about targeting Jews. This reflects a growing polarization and the complexities of public opinion regarding the conflict, highlighting how social media and public demonstrations can influence perceptions and actions in real time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify headline's main point: anti-Israel activists' behavior and the newspaper's stance.\n2. Explain context: broader historical or current events related to anti-Israel activism.\n3. Assess relevance and accuracy of external knowledge used in explanation.",
