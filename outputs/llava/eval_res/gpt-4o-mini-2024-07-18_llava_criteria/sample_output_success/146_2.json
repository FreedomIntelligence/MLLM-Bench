    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the exaggeration in the cat's expression and discuss how this hyperbole contributes to the meme's humor.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe meme contrasts two exaggerated expressions of a cat to humorously illustrate the effects of coffee. \n\n1. **Before Coffee**: The cat appears grumpy and lethargic, with narrowed eyes and a flat mouth, conveying a sense of annoyance or fatigue. This expression is hyperbolic, as it amplifies the common feeling of being tired or unmotivated before caffeine kicks in.\n\n2. **After Coffee**: In stark contrast, the cat's expression is wildly enthusiastic, with wide eyes and a big, open-mouthed grin. This hyperbole captures the sudden surge of energy and excitement many people feel after consuming coffee.\n\nThe humor arises from this exaggerated transformation, relatable to anyone who has experienced the drastic change in mood and energy levels associated with coffee consumption. The stark visual difference between the two states highlights the comedic effect, making it a playful commentary on daily routines and caffeine dependency.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the meme, the cat's expression has been exaggerated with captions showing the cat after consuming coffee, and then again after consuming caffeine. This hyperbole amplifies the humorous effect of the image by making the cat appear to be in a state of extreme stimulation and excitement. This exaggerated behavior is contrasted to the cat's natural state, which is typically more calm and relaxed. This exaggeration triggers a reaction in the viewer, as it is difficult to imagine a cat experiencing such strong effects from coffee or caffeine. By using this imaginative and humorous twist, the meme creator successfully generates laughter and engagement from the audience.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe the exaggerated facial expressions of the cat in both images.\n2. Explain how the change in expression from \"before\" to \"after\" coffee creates humor.\n3. Assess the use of hyperbole in linking the cat's expressions to the effects of coffee.",
