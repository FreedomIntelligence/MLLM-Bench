    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCompare the visual design elements of the monsters, such as texture, coloration, and body structure.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, both monsters have a menacing appearance, with a combination of rough texture and bold colors. They are closely facing each other, emphasizing the visual impact of their respective features. The first monster, located on the left, has a large, spiky, and clawed body structure, with a dark, almost gray-blue hue. On the other hand, the second monster is more towards the right and has a noticeably different appearance. This monster has a more prominent spiky head and is colored a mix of dark gray, black, and a few orange or red tones, giving it a more intimidating appearance. Although the two monsters have different body structures and colors, their overall visual design elements contribute to the action and intensity of the scene, making it an exciting and eye-catching image.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the image of the monsters, the visual design elements showcase distinct differences in texture, coloration, and body structure.\n\n### Texture:\n- **Godzilla**: The texture appears rugged and scaly, resembling reptilian skin. This gives it a formidable and ancient look, emphasizing its monstrous nature. The scales are detailed, creating a sense of realism and weight.\n- **Kong**: In contrast, Kong's texture is fur-covered, providing a softer and more organic appearance. The fur adds depth and a sense of warmth, contrasting with Godzilla's cold, hard scales.\n\n### Coloration:\n- **Godzilla**: The coloration is primarily dark, with shades of green and gray, accented by hints of blue or black. This palette enhances its intimidating presence and aligns with its portrayal as a destructive force.\n- **Kong**: Kong features a lighter, earthy color scheme, with browns and tans dominating. This choice evokes a more natural and relatable creature, emphasizing its connection to the primal aspects of nature.\n\n### Body Structure:\n- **Godzilla**: Godzilla has a bulky, robust body with a strong, muscular build, designed to convey power and dominance. Its elongated tail and spiky dorsal fins add to its imposing silhouette.\n- **Kong**: Kong has a more humanoid structure, with a broad chest and powerful limbs, suggesting agility and strength. Its posture is more upright, reflecting its intelligence and ability to interact with its environment in a more nuanced way than Godzilla.\n\nOverall, these visual design elements create a stark contrast between the two monsters, highlighting their unique characteristics and roles within their narratives.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and compare textures of Godzilla and King Kong.\n2. Describe and contrast the coloration of both monsters.\n3. Compare the body structures, focusing on distinguishing features.",
