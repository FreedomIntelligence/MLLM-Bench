    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExamine the images on the left-hand side and right-hand side closely to identify and compare the differences between them as much as possible.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, there are two different representations of a puppy on a leash carrying a backpack. The two images can be distinguished by analyzing the expressions of the cute puppy. While the puppy is walking, it has a distinctive smile on its face, indicating that it is happy and enjoying the moment. In various locations throughout the images, you can also see the grass on the ground, adding to the visual context of the scene. The two different expressions of the puppy and the overall atmosphere in both pictures can be compared, highlighting the variations in their expressions and the overall scene they depict.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nHere are the differences between the two images:\n\n1. **Backpacks**: The dog on the left has a backpack with straps that are more defined, while the right dog has a simpler design for the backpack.\n\n2. **Pants**: The dog on the left has lighter-colored shorts, whereas the dog on the right has darker shorts.\n\n3. **Hands**: The dog on the right is waving with one hand raised, while the left dog has both hands down.\n\n4. **Facial Expressions**: The left dog has a more neutral expression, while the right dog appears to be smiling more broadly.\n\n5. **Book**: The left dog is holding a book with a defined cover, while the right dog has a book that looks less detailed.\n\n6. **Tail Position**: The tails of the dogs differ; the left dog's tail is more curled, while the right dog's tail is more straight.\n\n7. **Feet**: The left dog has a more rounded shoe design, while the right dog has a slightly different shape for its shoes.\n\nThese differences create a distinct look for each character despite their similarities.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify differences: eye color, belt, shirt stripes, facial hair, eyebrow, socks, left dog's bag, left dog's eyelash, left dog's mouth wrinkle.\n2. Ensure all differences listed in the reference are mentioned accurately.\n3. Compare both images for any additional differences not listed in the reference.",
