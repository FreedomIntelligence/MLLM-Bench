    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nUtilize the numbers within the hexagon (you can use each number more than once) and the operators contained within the rounded square set to derive the numerical number found in the upper-left corner of the image. Provide one possible combination.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo achieve the target number of 221 using the numbers 3, 7, 1, 9, 5, and 2, along with the operators +, -, ×, ÷, one possible combination is:\n\n\\[\n(7 \\times 3 \\times 9) + (2 \\times 5) = 189 + 10 = 199\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't reach 221, so let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 5 \\times 5) - (7 \\times 3) = 225 - 21 = 204\n\\]\n\nStill not correct. \n\nAfter some trials:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 5 \\times 5) - (3 \\times 1) = 225 - 3 = 222\n\\]\n\nStill not quite there. \n\nFinally:\n\n\\[\n(7 \\times 3 \\times 9) + 2 = 189 + 2 = 191\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 5 \\times 5) - 3 = 225 - 3 = 222\n\\]\n\nFinally:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 5 \\times 5) - 2 = 225 - 4 = 221\n\\]\n\nSo, one possible combination to reach 221 could be:\n\n\\[\n(9 \\times 5 \\times 5) - 4 = 221\n\\]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe number in the upper-left corner of the image is 21. This can be derived by using the numbers in the hexagon and the operators found in the rounded square set. One possible combination is:\n\n(2)(1) + (9)(9) = 21\n\nThis can be achieved by multiplying the two numbers 2 and 9 and then adding the result to itself, yielding 21.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer must correctly calculate to 221 using numbers in hexagons and operators in rounded square.\n2. All numbers and operators used should be present in the image.\n3. Provide one valid mathematical expression that equals 221.",
