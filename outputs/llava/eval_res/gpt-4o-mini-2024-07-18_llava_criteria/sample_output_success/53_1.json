    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nPlease describe the architectural style and possible design concept of the architect of the landmark in this picture.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe architectural style of the landmark in the image is a modern, futuristic design, featuring large, curved surfaces and a strong emphasis on lighting. The building appears to be a large, illuminated museum or a significant public structure located near the ocean. The design concept may have been inspired by the surrounding natural environment, focusing on the interplay between organic shapes and clean, minimalist lines. The use of vibrant colors, such as red and green, along with the integration of the building façade with the water's edge, adds an artistic and visually striking element to the structure. This design approach creates a memorable and unique landmark that captures the essence of the modern architectural movement, while also providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe landmark depicted in the image is the Sydney Opera House, which is renowned for its distinctive architectural style characterized by its unique shell-like forms. \n\n### Architectural Style:\n- **Modernist Architecture**: The Sydney Opera House is a prime example of modernist architecture, emphasizing innovative forms and structures.\n- **Expressionist Design**: Its design embodies expressionism, focusing on bold, sculptural forms that evoke emotion and a sense of movement.\n\n### Design Concept:\n- **Sailing Ship Inspiration**: The design, conceived by architect Jørn Utzon, draws inspiration from the sails of boats, reflecting Sydney's maritime culture.\n- **Organic Forms**: The use of organic, flowing shapes creates a sense of harmony with the surrounding environment, particularly the harbor.\n- **Light and Reflection**: The structure interacts beautifully with natural light, creating dynamic reflections on the water, enhancing its visual appeal.\n\nOverall, the Sydney Opera House is celebrated not only for its striking appearance but also for its innovative engineering and integration with its scenic surroundings.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
