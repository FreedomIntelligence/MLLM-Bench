Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nRecognize the text in the image and the implicit message conveyed.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe text in the image reads: \"LIFE IS A STRAIGHT ROAD TO SUCCESS.\"\n\nThe implicit message conveyed here suggests that life is straightforward and that achieving success is a clear and direct path. However, the surrounding artwork, which features smiling faces and a vibrant background, might contrast with this notion, hinting at the complexities and challenges of life that often complicate the journey to success. This juxtaposition invites viewers to reflect on the reality that while success may seem straightforward, the journey is often filled with obstacles and nuances.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe text in the image is a saying or a motivational quote, which reads \"Life is a Straight Road to Success.\" The message conveyed by this quote is that success is a direct and clear pathway, and that with determination and effort, one can achieve success in life. The red background and bold lettering emphasize the importance and positivity of the message.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1.
