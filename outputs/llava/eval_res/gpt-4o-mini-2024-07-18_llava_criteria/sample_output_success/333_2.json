    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the extent of damage on the phone and examine if the phone is usable without repair.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe phone in the image shows significant damage, particularly on the back cover, which is cracked and appears to be coming apart at the edges. Here are some points to consider regarding its usability:\n\n1. **Physical Damage**: The cracks on the back may not affect the phone's functionality directly, but they can compromise the structural integrity and expose internal components to dust and moisture.\n\n2. **Camera and Ports**: If the cracks extend to the camera or ports, this could affect their functionality. It’s important to check if the camera lens is damaged or if the charging port is accessible.\n\n3. **Screen Condition**: The front screen is not visible in this image, but if it is intact and functioning properly, the phone may still be usable for basic tasks.\n\n4. **Performance**: If the internal components are unharmed and the phone powers on, it may still be usable for calls, messaging, and apps.\n\n5. **Repair Considerations**: While it might be usable as is, repairing the back cover would enhance durability and protect internal components.\n\nIn summary, the phone may still be operational, but the extent of damage suggests that it would benefit from repair for optimal use and protection.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nBased on the image, the back of the iPhone is cracked, which indicates that the phone has sustained some damage. The cracked screen might still be functional and usable, but the structural integrity of the phone is compromised. It is highly recommended to seek repair for the cracked iPhone to avoid further damage or risk to the electronic components. Additionally, a cracked screen may affect the aesthetics of the phone, and having it repaired would restore the original appearance and functionality of the device.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify visible damage, such as cracks or breaks, and assess impact on phone functionality.\n2. Confirm if the phone's damage renders it unusable without repair, as the answer is that the phone is not usable.\n3. Evaluate if any part of the phone appears intact, suggesting possible usability.",
