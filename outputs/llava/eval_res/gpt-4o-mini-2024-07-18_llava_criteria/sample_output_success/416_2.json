    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a dense caption that describes the intricate patterns, the depth and texture of the carved wood, and any symmetrical or asymmetrical elements.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThis exquisite carved wood panel showcases a mesmerizing interplay of intricate patterns, revealing a stunning depth and texture that draws the eye.
