    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nHow can you improve the quality of the image?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe quality of the image can be improved by reducing the background noise and increasing contrast. Since the image is a nighttime shot of a home with lights on, the primary focus should be on the house and the illuminated features. To enhance the contrast, it's advisable to tweak the exposure settings or use a lens with a higher aperture to capture more light in the shot. Additionally, consider using a tripod to steady the camera, adjusting white balance settings to ensure accurate colors, and applying noise reduction techniques to minimize background noise and create a clearer, more detailed picture of the illuminated house.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo improve the quality of the image, consider the following techniques:\n\n1. **Adjust Brightness and Contrast**: Increase the brightness to make the details more visible, and adjust the contrast to enhance the difference between light and dark areas.\n\n2. **Use Noise Reduction**: Apply noise reduction filters to minimize graininess, especially in low-light areas.\n\n3. **Sharpen the Image**: Use sharpening tools to enhance the edges and details, making the image appear clearer.\n\n4. **Color Correction**: Adjust the color balance to ensure that the colors appear more natural, especially if the image has a color cast.\n\n5. **Crop and Straighten**: If needed, crop out any unnecessary parts of the image and straighten it for better composition.\n\n6. **Enhance Highlights and Shadows**: Use tools to bring out highlights in the lights and details in the shadows, ensuring a balanced exposure.\n\n7. **Use Editing Software**: Programs like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom offer advanced tools for all these adjustments.\n\n8. **Consider Filters**: Applying a subtle filter can enhance the overall look of the image.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can significantly enhance the quality and visual appeal of the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Suggest increasing brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.\n2. Recommend noise reduction to improve image clarity.\n3. Advise on sharpening to define edges and details better.",
