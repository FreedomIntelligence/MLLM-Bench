    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the primary structure in the image and describe its architectural style and features.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe primary structure in the image is the **Manhattan Bridge**, which is an iconic suspension bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City. \n\n### Architectural Style:\n- **Suspension Bridge**: The Manhattan Bridge features a classic suspension design, characterized by its large main cables, which are anchored at either end and support the bridge deck through vertical suspender cables.\n\n### Features:\n- **Steel Framework**: The bridge is constructed from steel, giving it a robust and industrial appearance.\n- **Art Deco Elements**: The bridge includes Art Deco design features, especially noticeable in the decorative elements and the towers.\n- **Wide Span**: It has a significant main span, allowing for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n- **Viewpoint**: The perspective in the image frames the bridge between the surrounding buildings, highlighting its prominence in the urban landscape.\n\nOverall, the Manhattan Bridge is a vital transportation link and a notable example of early 20th-century engineering and design.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe primary structure in the image is the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge in New York City, built in 1883. It spans over the East River, connecting the borough of Brooklyn with Manhattan. The bridge has a distinctive twin-tower design, with two towers at the abutments on each end of the bridge. These towers house the cable supports and carry the weight of the suspended bridge deck, which is suspended from them. The bridge's architectural style is a blend of Gothic and Romanesque influences, making it an important historical and cultural landmark.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the response correctly recognizes the primary structure as a bridge.\n2. Describe the architectural style of the bridge (e.g., suspension, cable-stayed).\n3. Mention specific features of the bridge (e.g., towers, cables).",
