    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat would be the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image? The image size is 1300*1300\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n[0.41, 0.05, 0.76, 0.28]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nTo determine the bounding box coordinates for the strawberry in the image, you would typically identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of the strawberry's area. \n\nGiven that the image size is 1300x1300 pixels, you can visually inspect the strawberry's position. For example, if the strawberry is located approximately at:\n\n- **Top-left corner**: (600, 200)\n- **Bottom-right corner**: (750, 350)\n\nThe bounding box coordinates would be:\n\n- **Top-left**: (600, 200)\n- **Bottom-right**: (750, 350)\n\nAdjust these coordinates based on the actual position of the strawberry in the image.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correct identification of the strawberry's bounding box coordinates.\n2. Bounding box should tightly enclose the entire strawberry.\n3. Coordinates must be accurate relative to the image's dimensions.",
