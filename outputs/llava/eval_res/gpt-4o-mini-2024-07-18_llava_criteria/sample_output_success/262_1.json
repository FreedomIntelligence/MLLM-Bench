    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nExplain why these people in the picture are covering their faces with veils and analyze the reasons for this weather occurrence.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe people in the picture are covering their faces with veils to protect themselves from the dust, sand, and wind in the arid environment. The windy day, likely sandstorms, is causing sand to be blown around and lifted into the air, creating a challenging environment for the people in the scene. The veils serve as a barrier to shield them from the dust and debris, as well as from the harsh conditions of the sandstorm. The reason for this weather occurrence could be attributed to various factors, such as climate change, human activities, and natural weather patterns; for instance, deforestation, overgrazing, or soil degradation can contribute to arid environments and increased sandstorms.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe individuals in the picture are covering their faces with veils primarily to protect themselves from harsh environmental conditions, likely due to a sandstorm or dust storm. These weather events occur when strong winds lift sand and dust particles into the air, reducing visibility and creating hazardous conditions. \n\nCovering the face helps to shield against inhalation of dust particles, which can cause respiratory issues, and protects the skin from irritation. Additionally, the veils can help to keep the face and eyes shielded from the abrasive particles carried by the wind.\n\nDust storms often occur in arid and semi-arid regions, especially during dry seasons when soil is loose and winds are strong. Factors such as drought, land degradation, and climate change can exacerbate the frequency and intensity of these storms, making protective measures even more crucial for those living in affected areas.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify sandstorm as the reason for people covering faces with veils.\n2. Describe protective function of veils against sand inhalation and eye irritation.\n3. Explain sandstorms as a weather occurrence caused by strong winds lifting sand.",
