    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nIdentify the object in the image and point out the difference between it and the general fan.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe image features a portable space heater, often referred to as a small stove, sitting next to a black control panel. The heater has a circular fan next to it that can be used for direct heating of a small area. This is different from a general fan, as the heater is designed for providing warmth and comfort instead of just circulating air or cooling. The heater and the fan are both black and compact, making them suitable for personal use and travel. However, the heater is specifically designed for heating purposes and is not a general appliance like a regular fan.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe object in the image is a space heater. \n\n### Differences Between a Space Heater and a General Fan:\n\n1. **Functionality**:\n   - **Space Heater**: Generates heat to warm up a room.\n   - **Fan**: Circulates air to create a cooling effect.\n\n2. **Heating Element**:\n   - **Space Heater**: Contains heating elements (like coils or ceramic) to produce warmth.\n   - **Fan**: Does not have heating elements; it simply moves air.\n\n3. **Temperature Control**:\n   - **Space Heater**: Often has adjustable temperature settings and may include a thermostat.\n   - **Fan**: Typically has speed settings but does not control temperature.\n\n4. **Usage Context**:\n   - **Space Heater**: Used primarily in colder months for heating.\n   - **Fan**: Used in warmer months for cooling.\n\n5. **Design**:\n   - **Space Heater**: Usually enclosed with a front grille and may have a remote control.\n   - **Fan**: Generally has an open design with blades visible.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the object as a heater, not a fan.\n2. Note the heater's heat emission, contrasting with a fan's air circulation.",
