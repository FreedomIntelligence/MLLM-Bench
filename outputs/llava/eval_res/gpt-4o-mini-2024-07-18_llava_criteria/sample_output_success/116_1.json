    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nProvide a detailed description of the emotion being expressed and propose several contexts or situations that could be causing the emotion.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the image is exhibiting an emotion that can be interpreted as sadness or disgust. She is covering her nose with her hand, perhaps indicating that she is experiencing an unpleasant odor or feeling overwhelmed by her surroundings.\n\nThere could be several situations or contexts that might cause or contribute to her emotional state. For instance, she may have encountered an unpleasant smell in the environment, such as a strong odor or an unclean area. Alternatively, she could be reacting to a troubling event, like witnessing a crime, experiencing a personal problem, or feeling distressed by the actions of someone around her. It's also possible that the girl is just reacting to a simple distraction or discomfort, such as a loud noise or an overpowering smell, and her emotional expression might be an exaggeration or an overreaction to a minor situation.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe emotion being expressed appears to be one of discomfort or distress. The gesture of raising a hand, possibly in a stop or defensive manner, suggests a desire to create distance or to signal that something is unwanted or overwhelming. This could indicate feelings of anxiety, frustration, or a need for personal space.\n\nSeveral contexts or situations that could be causing this emotion include:\n\n1. **Social Overwhelm**: The individual might be in a crowded or noisy environment where they feel overwhelmed by too much sensory input, prompting a need to retreat or signal discomfort.\n\n2. **Conflict or Confrontation**: They could be experiencing a tense interaction with someone, leading to feelings of anxiety or the instinct to protect oneself from potential conflict.\n\n3. **Personal Boundaries**: The gesture may arise in a situation where someone is feeling their personal boundaries are being violated, whether physically or emotionally, prompting a defensive response.\n\n4. **Emotional Overload**: The person might be dealing with a stressful situation, such as receiving bad news or facing an emotional challenge, leading to an instinctive reaction to shield themselves.\n\n5. **Self-Protection**: They could be in a situation where they feel threatened or unsafe, whether due to a person’s behavior or a specific circumstance, causing them to physically express a desire to disengage.\n\nThese contexts highlight the complexity of human emotions and the various triggers that can lead to such expressions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Confirm the emotion matches 'shy' with facial cues like averting gaze or a slight smile.",
