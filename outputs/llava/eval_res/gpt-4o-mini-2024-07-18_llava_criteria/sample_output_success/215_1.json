    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWhat does this chart imply?\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe chart implies that global mean temperature has steadily risen since the 1800s, as the line trends upwards. This suggests that there has been an increase in the average global temperature, which is consistent with the idea of climate change. The data showcases the long-term temperature trend and highlights the significance of addressing environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, to mitigate the impact of climate change on our planet.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe chart shows the global mean temperature compared to the average from 1850-1900, indicating a significant upward trend over time. Key implications include:\n\n1. **Rising Temperatures**: There is a clear increase in global temperatures since the late 19th century, with a marked acceleration in recent decades.\n\n2. **Variability**: While there are fluctuations year-to-year, the overall trend is upward, suggesting long-term climate change.\n\n3. **Data Consistency**: Multiple datasets (HadCRUT5, NOAA, GISTEMP, etc.) show similar trends, reinforcing the reliability of the findings.\n\n4. **Climate Change Awareness**: The data underscores the urgency of addressing climate change, as rising temperatures can lead to severe environmental impacts.\n\nOverall, the chart illustrates the reality of global warming and its potential implications for the planet.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Answer identifies the chart implies an increase in global mean temperature, suggesting global warming.\n2. Answer explains the upward trend observed in the temperature datasets from 1850 to 2023.\n3. Answer interprets the consistency across multiple datasets in supporting the implication of global warming.",
