    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nThe image shows a series of figures in chronological order. What is the trend of change in the predicted graph? Explain the reasons for this trend of change.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe figures depict a trend of change in body composition over time for both male and female representations. \n\n1. **Male Figures**: The trend shows a progression from a fit, muscular physique to a more rounded and heavier appearance. This change may represent factors such as lifestyle changes, decreased physical activity, or dietary habits leading to weight gain.\n\n2. **Female Figures**: Similarly, the female figures transition from a fit and toned look to a fuller figure. This could indicate similar lifestyle changes, stress, hormonal factors, or changes in metabolism that contribute to weight gain over time.\n\nOverall, the trend reflects common patterns of weight fluctuation, which can be influenced by various factors such as lifestyle choices, aging, and health conditions.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe trend of change in the predicted graph is that the waistline of the figures gradually increases from one figure to the next. This represents the accumulation of extra fat over time, which is a common concern in the context of obesity. The series of figures, each showing a person wearing blue shorts and a spaghetti-string top, are used to explain the consequences of poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in obesity and its related health problems. This sequence is a visual representation of the potential health risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the answer recognizes the trend of increasing body weight.\n2. Assess the explanation for the rising trend, relating to the figures' changes.\n3. Confirm the answer follows a chronological analysis of the figures.",
