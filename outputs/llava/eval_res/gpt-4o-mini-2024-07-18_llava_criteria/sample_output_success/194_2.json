    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nGiven the image, determine the different parts of the ECG waveform and identify abnormalities in the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\ncompound\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the ECG waveform, the key components are:\n\n1. **P Wave**: Represents atrial depolarization.\n2. **QRS Complex**: Represents ventricular depolarization.\n   - **Q Wave**: Initial downward deflection.\n   - **R Wave**: The upward deflection.\n   - **S Wave**: The downward deflection following the R wave.\n3. **T Wave**: Represents ventricular repolarization.\n4. **U Wave**: Sometimes seen, representing repolarization of the Purkinje fibers.\n\n### Identifying Abnormalities\n\nTo identify abnormalities in the ECG:\n\n1. **P Wave Abnormalities**: Look for changes in shape or height, which may indicate atrial enlargement.\n2. **QRS Complex**: \n   - Prolonged QRS may suggest bundle branch block or ventricular hypertrophy.\n   - Abnormal Q waves can indicate previous myocardial infarction.\n3. **T Wave Changes**: \n   - Inverted T waves can indicate ischemia.\n   - Tall, peaked T waves may suggest hyperkalemia.\n4. **Rhythm**: Check for regularity. Irregular rhythms may indicate atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias.\n5. **ST Segment**: Elevation or depression can indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n\n### Observations\n\nWithout specific details on the waveform, look for:\n\n- Regularity of the rhythm.\n- The morphology of P, QRS, and T waves.\n- Any significant deviations from normal intervals (PR, QRS, QT).\n\nIf you have specific abnormalities in mind or need further analysis, please let me know!\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image displays an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform with several parts, including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave. These parts represent the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. The P-wave is a small waveform that represents atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex is the largest waveform and signifies ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n\nIn the provided image, there is a red line drawn across the center of the ECG, which could be a lead wire. The ECG waveform shows some abnormalities, such as a long QT interval, which is visible in the QT segment of the waveform. A long QT interval may result in increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. It is important to evaluate the specifics of the ECG waveform and any potential abnormalities as part of a medical assessment in such cases.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe P wave, QRS complex, T wave as per reference.\n2. Detect any deviations from the normal ECG waveform pattern.\n3. Comment on rhythm regularity, wave amplitude, and intervals between waves.",
