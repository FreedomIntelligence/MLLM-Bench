    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a CT report for this image as a brain specialist.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\n**CT Report**\n\n**Patient Information:**\n- Name: [Patient Name]\n- Age: [Patient Age]\n- Gender: [Patient Gender]\n- Date of Examination: [Date]\n\n**Clinical History:**\nThe patient presents with [symptoms, e.g., headaches, seizures, neurological deficits]. A CT scan of the brain was ordered to evaluate for possible intracranial pathology.\n\n**Technique:**\nNon-contrast CT scan of the brain was performed in axial sections.\n\n**Findings:**\n\n1. **Lesion Identification:**\n   - A well-defined, hyperdense mass is noted in the [specific location, e.g., right frontal lobe]. The lesion measures approximately [size] cm in diameter.\n   - Surrounding edema is present, with a significant hypodense area indicating associated edema.\n\n2. **Midline Shift:**\n   - There is a mild midline shift of the brain structures towards the [left/right] side, suggesting increased intracranial pressure.\n\n3. **Ventricular System:**\n   - The ventricular system appears [normal/dilated/compressed], with no evidence of hydrocephalus.\n\n4. **Cerebral Sulci:**\n   - The cerebral sulci are [normal/effaced], indicating possible mass effect from the lesion.\n\n5. **Other Findings:**\n   - No acute hemorrhage is identified.\n   - No other focal lesions or significant calcifications are observed.\n\n**Impression:**\n- The findings are suggestive of a [possible diagnosis, e.g., glioma, meningioma, metastasis]. Further evaluation with MRI is recommended for better characterization of the lesion and to assess for any additional abnormalities.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Consider MRI of the brain.\n- Neurology/Oncology referral for further management.\n\n**Radiologist:**\n[Name]\n[Title]\n[Date of Report]\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nUpon examining the black and white image of a brain slice, I notice a benign-looking abnormality. The focal point of this image is an irregularity, possibly a cyst or fluid-filled sac within the cerebellum. I recommend further investigation to determine the nature and potential implications of this finding.\n\nThe rest of the cerebral tissues, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar hemispheres, appear relatively normal in the image. However, the presence of the irregularity in the cerebellum may warrant additional imaging techniques or consultation with a neurosurgeon to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify and describe any abnormalities visible in the brain CT image.\n2. Use appropriate medical terminology related to brain anatomy and pathology.\n3. Provide a structured report format, including observations and conclusions.",
