Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nSolve the problem in the image and provide a detailed explanation.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nclose-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nTo solve the problem, we need to break down the information given step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Number of People**: \n   - At 9:00 AM, there are **5 people** at the zoo.\n\n2. **People Arriving at 11:00 AM**: \n   - At 11:00 AM, **4 more people** arrive.\n   - To find the total number of people at this point, we add the initial number of people to the number of people who arrived:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ (initial)} + 4 \\text{ (arrived)} = 9 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n3. **People Arriving at 12:00 PM (Noon)**: \n   - Finally, at noon, **7 more people** come.\n   - We add this to the current total:\n     \\[\n     9 \\text{ (current total)} + 7 \\text{ (arrived)} = 16 \\text{ people}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Count**: \n   - Therefore, the total number of people at the zoo now is **16 people**.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"How many people are at the zoo now?\" is **16**.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe image features a piece of paper with handwritten text describing the movements of people at a zoo. It appears to be a timeline or a summary of people's visits to the zoo. The paper contains several times, such as 11:30 and 7:30, along with numbers of people visiting at these times. Additionally, there is a question at the end of the text that appears to be related to the overall content. Based on the information available, it's difficult to provide a more detailed explanation without additional context.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Correctly transcribe the handwritten text, including numbers and words.\n2. Accurately solve the arithmetic problem presented in the text, whose answer is 16.\n3. Provide a clear explanation of the steps taken to reach the solution.",
