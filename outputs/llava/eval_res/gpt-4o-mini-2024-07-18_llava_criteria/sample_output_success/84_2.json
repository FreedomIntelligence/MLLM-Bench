    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nDescribe the feature of the animal as detail as possible to help other people to recognize it.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe animal in the image appears to be a fish, likely a type of wrasse. Here are some detailed features to help with identification:\n\n1. **Body Shape**: The fish has an elongated, somewhat cylindrical body typical of wrasses, which allows for agile swimming.\n\n2. **Coloration**: The predominant color is a vibrant green, with hints of yellow and blue. This coloration can help it blend into the coral reef environment.\n\n3. **Head Structure**: It has a slightly flattened head with a pronounced snout, which is characteristic of many wrasses. The mouth is prominent and may appear slightly rounded.\n\n4. **Fins**: The fish has a pair of pectoral fins that are relatively large and positioned towards the front of the body. The tail fin is forked and appears to be robust, aiding in swift movements.\n\n5. **Eyes**: The eyes are relatively large and positioned on the sides of the head, providing a wide field of vision.\n\n6. **Behavior**: If observed in an aquarium, it might be seen swimming actively or hovering near the substrate, which is typical behavior for wrasses as they search for food.\n\n7. **Habitat**: This type of fish is commonly found in coral reefs, where it can be seen among rocks and coral structures.\n\nThese features can help others recognize this fish in both natural and aquarium settings.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe animal in the image is a colorful fish with a blue and yellow body, which stands out in the blue underwater environment. It is swimming in a tank with a see-through wall, allowing observers to get a clear view of the fish up close. The fish has an elongated body, with long fins, making it appear elegant and unique. Its vibrant colors make it a visually appealing and interesting sight for those who appreciate aquatic life.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify the animal in the image as parrotfish.\n 2.Accurately describe the coloration, patterns, and any distinctive markings of the animal.\n3. Mention visible textures or features such as scales, eyes, and mouth shape.",
