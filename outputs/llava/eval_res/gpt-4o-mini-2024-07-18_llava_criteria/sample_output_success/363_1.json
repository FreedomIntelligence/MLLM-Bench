Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nCapture the city's night life, the interplay of darkness and lights, and the tranquil urban mood by the water in a poem.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the dark city night,  \nTall buildings stand illuminated,  \nGlowing with golden lights,  \nLike a starry sky above.\n\nThe ocean wind, it howls and sighs,  \nA melancholic tune that resonates,  \nAs the waves crash on the shore,  \nAnd the world falls into a state of slumber.\n\nAmidst this serene scene,  \nThe city's lights shine bright,  \nIntermingling with the darkness,  \nA dance of contrast and harmony in night.\n\nThe buildings, they seem to rise,  \nDefying the laws of gravity,  \nA testament to the urban dream,  \nA world of possibilities and aspirations.\n\nAnd yet, as the night unfolds,  \nThe cityscape takes a backseat,  \nAs the gentle lapping of the ocean waves,  \nEchoes the heartbeat of the city's rest.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nIn the hush of night, the city breathes,  \nWhere shadows dance with flickering lights,  \nA symphony of whispers on the breeze,  \nAs stars peek through the velvet heights.  \n\nThe water shimmers, a silver thread,  \nReflecting dreams in its gentle sway,  \nWhile laughter mingles with the soft tread,  \nOf souls who wander, lost in the play.  \n\nBuildings rise like sentinels bold,  \nTheir windows aglow with stories untold,  \nEach light a heartbeat, each shadow a sigh,  \nIn the tranquil embrace of the night sky.  \n\nBy the water's edge, the world slows down,  \nAs waves kiss the shore with a tender grace,  \nThe city wears its nocturnal crown,  \nBathed in a glow, a serene embrace.  \n\nSo let the night unfold its tale,  \nIn the interplay of darkness and light,  \nFor in this urban dream, we set sail,  \nFinding peace in the heart of the night.  \n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Poem reflects contrast between city lights and night darkness, capturing the urban atmosphere.\n2. Includes elements of tranquil mood by the water, suggesting peacefulness amidst city life.\n3. Evokes the essence of night life without directly describing people or specific activities.",
