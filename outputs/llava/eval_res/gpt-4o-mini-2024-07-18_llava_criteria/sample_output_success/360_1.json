    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nWrite a story based on the image.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nIn the image, we see a dog sitting on a mat, surrounded by an airplane and airplane toys. The dog seems to be resting and enjoying the cozy airplane-inspired bed. There are books scattered around the room, indicating that this space might be used for play, relaxation, or learning.\n\nIt's possible that the dog's owner is nearby, engaged in some activity or enjoying a meal, as there are two carrots visible on the floor, likely meant for sharing with the dog. A cup can also be seen on the floor, suggesting that the person might be having a drink while spending time with the dog.\n\nAs we look closer at the scene, we notice that the dog is carrying a book, adding a playful touch to the scene. The books' presence, along with the airplane toys, creates an imaginative and creative environment for the dog and its owner to enjoy.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nOnce upon a time in a cozy little room, a boy named Max lay in bed, his mind swirling with thoughts of school. The moonlight streamed through his window, illuminating his colorful room filled with toys and books. Max had a big math test the next day, and the numbers danced in his head like playful fireflies.\n\nAs he stared at the ceiling, he began to worry about the multiplication tables. “What if I forget?” he murmured to himself. Suddenly, his loyal dog, Bingo, trotted over, sensing Max’s unease. With a gentle nudge, Bingo encouraged him to relax.\n\nMax closed his eyes and imagined a classroom where Bingo was the teacher. In this dream, Bingo wore a tiny pair of glasses and stood at the front of the class, confidently writing on the chalkboard. “7 times 5 equals 35!” he barked, wagging his tail proudly. The other kids giggled and cheered, and Max felt a wave of relief wash over him.\n\nIn the dream, Max raised his hand, excited to answer questions. With Bingo’s encouragement, he solved problems and helped his classmates. “Math can be fun!” he exclaimed, and the room erupted in applause.\n\nAs the dream continued, Max felt a sense of confidence growing inside him. He realized that with practice and a little help from his furry friend, he could tackle anything that came his way.\n\nWhen Max woke up the next morning, he felt ready for the test. With Bingo by his side, he knew he could face whatever challenges lay ahead. Together, they dashed off to school, ready to conquer the day, one multiplication problem at a time.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Story includes boy dreaming about math, dog attending school, and bedroom setting.\n2. Narrative coherence; beginning, middle, and end structured around the image.\n3. Creative elements that enhance the visual elements without altering them.",
