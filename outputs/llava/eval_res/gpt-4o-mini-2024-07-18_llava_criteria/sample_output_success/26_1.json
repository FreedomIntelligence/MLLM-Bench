    "prompt": "### You are an excellent evaluator.\n### Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.\n### Each evaluation consists of *an image*, *a question*, a *question type*, and *two corresponding answers*. Your task is to discern which answer is superior based on the **quality** and its alignment w.r.t the image.\n### There are only two situations where you may choose 'unable to decide':\n#### Situation one: The question type is 'close-ended' and both answers are correct or wrong. \n#### Situation two: Both answers contain considerable factual errors or ethical issues.\n### Otherwise, you should always choose a better answer by responding 'Answer1' or 'Answer2'.\n### You should ONLY output your vote 'Answer1', 'Answer2', 'unable to decide: situation one', or 'unable to decide: situation two' in the last line.\n\n~~~Question\nEvaluate the writing posture of the girl in the picture and make some suggestions.\n~~~\n~~~Question Type\nopen-ended\n~~~\n~~~Answer1\nThe girl in the photo appears to have her elbow resting on the desk while writing. While this posture may provide additional support and comfort, it is not ideal for maintaining a proper and healthy writing posture. For better posture, the girl should consider adopting one of the following suggestions:\n\n1. Hold the pen or pencil in both hands and use a firm grip to minimize strain on the wrist and fingers.\n2. Place the notebook or book on a flat surface, like a desk or a lap, allowing the writing surface to be easily accessible.\n3. Keep the elbows slightly bent and maintain a relaxed, neutral position while writing.\n4. Maintain a comfortable position for the wrists and avoid bending them excessively while writing.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the girl can improve her writing posture, reduce the risk of strain or discomfort, and maintain a healthy and efficient writing experience.\n~~~\n~~~Answer2\nThe writing posture observed suggests that the girl may be leaning forward, which can lead to discomfort over time. Here are some suggestions to improve her writing posture:\n\n1. **Sit Up Straight**: Encourage her to keep her back straight and shoulders relaxed. This helps reduce strain on the back and neck.\n\n2. **Feet Flat on the Floor**: Her feet should be flat on the ground or supported by a footrest to promote stability and comfort.\n\n3. **Table Height**: Ensure the writing surface is at an appropriate height, allowing her elbows to rest comfortably on the table while writing.\n\n4. **Wrist Position**: Encourage her to keep her wrist straight while writing to prevent strain. A slight elevation of the paper can help with this.\n\n5. **Take Breaks**: Remind her to take short breaks to stretch and relax her muscles, which can help maintain comfort during longer writing sessions.\n\nBy implementing these adjustments, she can enhance her writing posture and overall comfort.\n~~~### Please refer to the given criteria when you making the judgement\nCriteria: 1. Identify if the girl's posture is ergonomically correct for writing.\n2. Assess the angle of the girl's neck and back in relation to the desk.\n3. Suggest improvements for a healthier writing posture.",
